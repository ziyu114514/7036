CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Weichai Power (000338 CH)
Impressive 1Q23 earnings UG to BUY More
Weichais 1Q23 net profit growth of 68% YoY is above our expectation We
believe the impressive earnings growth was driven by the strong operating
leverage of the HDT engine segment We are turning more positive on Weichais
LNG price (down 40% since Dec) that will boost the sales of LNG
trucksengines where Weichai has strong presence on (2) the easing supply
chain pressure that will help KION achieve strong-than-expected margin
recovery All these together with the continuous growth of engines for
agricultural machinery and HDT through rising penetration in LOVOL and
Sinotruk (3808 HK) prompted us to revise up our earnings forecast in
2023E24E by 30%28% Our SOTP-based TPs for Weichai AH are revised up
to RMB138HK158 Given that the HA discount (currently 11%) has been
narrowed and is close to the historical average of 12% we upgrade Weichai-
A to BUY from Hold and maintain BUY on Weichai-H
 1Q23 results highlights Weichais revenue of RMB534bn in 1Q23
represented 30%18% YoY growth respectively beforeafter restatement
of 1Q22 figures (Note LOVOL was a JV in 1Q22 as the consolidation took
place in Jun 2022) We believe the revenue growth in 1Q23 was driven by
the strong HDT engine sales volume and operating leverage Gross margin
was largely stable at 187% in 1Q23 With both SGA and RD expense
ratio reduced in 1Q23 net profit surged 77%68% YoY (beforeafter
restatement) to RMB186bn Based on our calculation the pretax profit
(excluding KION) surged 16x YoY in 1Q23 Operating cash flow in 1Q23
substantially improved to -RMB471mn (1Q22 -RMB32bn)
 Weichais engine sales outpaced industry in 1Q23 According to
CICEIA Weichais multi-cylinder sales grew 6% YoY to 183k units in 1Q23
(vs the industry average of a decline of 3%) with a market share of 16%
 Decline in LNG price positive to Weichai LNG price in late Apr has
declined 40% from the peak in Dec 2022 We believe it will potentially
boost the sales of LNG trucks given the lower operating cost to truck
owners We expect Weichai to be a key beneficiary as we estimate Weichai
has 40% market share in HDT gas engine
 Higher earnings guidance for KION Group KION (452% owned by
due to higher net finance expense In the 1Q23 report KION revised up the
full year adjusted EBIT target to EUR615mn from EUR500mn due to
improving supply chains
