CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Hikvision (002415 CH)
Taking time to recover
HOLD (Down)
Hikvision delivered a weaker than expected FY1Q23 with revenue of
RMB162bn (-2% YoY) and net profit of RMB181bn (-21% YoY) Sequential
improvement in top-line (vs -9% YoY in FY4Q22) and GPM (14 ppts YoY)
were the bright spots Hikvision will focus on quality growth in FY23E with better
control on project profitability headcount (10% YoY in FY22 stable in FY23E)
and opex We think recent share price rebound has reflected the positives in
earnings recovery and the RMB20bn share repurchase Downgrade to HOLD
 FY1Q23 miss although revenue decline narrowed and GPM improved
Hikvision reported in-line FY22 with revenue of RMB8317bn (2% YoY)
and net profit of RMB1284bn (-24% YoY) The weakness in net profit was
due to 1) GPM erosion (-2 ppts YoY to 423%) and 2) higher opex (17%
YoY) as headcount grew 10% YoY to 58280 FY1Q23 results remained
muted with revenue of RMB162bn (-2% YoY) and net profit of RMB181bn
(-21% YoY) A sequentially narrowed decline in top-line (-2% YoY vs  -9%
YoY in FY4Q22) and GPM improvement (14 pct pts YoY) were yet to
offset the higher opex (16% YoY)
 Positive on the innovative businesses growth prospect but yet to see
a rebound in PBG SMBG overseas segments Post-COVID recovery
was slower than expected that only EBG (Large Enterprise-focused)
resumed positive growth in FY1Q23 Rebound in PBG (Public Security)
SMBG (SME) and overseas business is not in sight yet That said we are
positive on the revenue diversification with innovative businesses (eg
Smart Home AIoT Robotics etc) revenue contribution rose to 18% in FY22
vs 10% in FY20 Non-surveillance business will remain as the core growth
driver (FY22 revenue grew 228% YoY to RMB1507bn)
 Focus on quality growth in FY23E Management believes Hikvision
business has bottomed out from the pandemic with FY4Q22 being the
trough We expect to see sequential improvement in top-line and margin as
project profitability headcount and opex We estimate Hikvision net margin
to improve from 154% in FY22 to 177% in FY23E
 Lack near-term catalysts downgrade to HOLD We trimmed FY23-24E
net profit by 7-9% to reflect a slow recovery from COVID Share price has
rebounded by 66% since its bottom in Oct 2022 We think the existing price
level has reflected the near-term positives (earnings recovery and the
target price of RMB4729 based on higher 27x (prior 20x) FY23E PE in-
line with 3-year mean as business bottomed out from COVID
