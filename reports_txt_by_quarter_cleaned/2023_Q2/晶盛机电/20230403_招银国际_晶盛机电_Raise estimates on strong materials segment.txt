Zhejiang Jingsheng (JSG)s net profit in 2022 surged 71% YoY to RMB29bn in
line with the pre-announced profit released in mid-Mar Net profit in 4Q22 grew
52% YoY to RMB915mn As of end-2022 total backlog (as of Jun) reached
RMB254bn (solarsemiconductor 87%13%) We estimate this offers good
will remain a key beneficiary of the tight supply of crucibles We therefore revise
up our earnings forecast in 2023E24E both by 9% due to higher revenue and
margin assumptions on the materials segments We raise our TP to RMB99
based on 33x 2023E PE on the back of 33% earnings growth in 2023E Longer
term import substitution through continuous breakthrough in semiconductor
equipment including SiC will offer upside to our current estimates Maintain BUY
 Strong growth of materials segment Revenue grew 78% YoY to
RMB106bn in 2022 By segment equipment revenue (solar  semiconductor)
grew 70% YoY RMB847bn Materials revenue (crucibles diamond wire saw
 sapphire) surged 27x YoY to RMB146bn implying 45x YoY growth in
2H22 Materials gross margin sharply expanded by 145ppt YoY to 39% in
2022 which partially offset the 18ppt contraction of equipment segment (to
408%) Blended gross margin in 2022 was therefore largely stable at 396%
 Operating expense largely under control SGA ratio dropped 07ppt YoY
to 31% in 2022 while RD expense ratio increased 16ppt YoY to 75% which
we believe is essential given the continuous development of new technology
JSC recognized RMB538mn (85% YoY) gains in 2022 which came mainly
from government subsidies
 Substantial increase in customers downpayment As at Dec 2022
contract liabilities (an indicator of down-payment from customers) surged 91%
YoY to RMB947bn We believe this suggests strong bargaining power of JSG
 Decline in operating cash flow should be temporary Operating cash flow
dropped 24% YoY to RMB13bn in 2022 due to large increase in inventory
(up RMB6bn YoY) That said 75% of the total inventories as of end-2022
(RMB123bn) belonged to goods in transit We expect the cash flow to see
improvement in 1H23E
 Risks 1) Slowdown in solar power capex 2) lower-than-expected gross
margin (3) risk of semiconductor business expansion
