Resilient FY221H23 despite industry headwinds
Luxshare posted FY22 revenueNP growth of 39%30% YoY largely in-line with
expectations and it also pre-announced 1H23 earnings growth of 10-20% YoY
which we believe is resilient given weakness in smartphone consumer
electronics market Given challenging macro headwinds Luxshare delivered
impressive operating efficiency and cost synergies Looking forward following
multiple strategic MAs in 202021 we believe Luxshare is well-positioned to
opportunities in automobile tier-1 biz and ARVR product cycle We adjusted
FY23-25E EPS by -2%2% to reflect macro headwinds and accelerated auto
segment The stock now trades at 152x FY23E PE close to 1-sd below 5-yr
average PE Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB480 based on lowered 28x

Reiterate BUY with new TP of RMB 480 (84% upside)
We derived our new 12m TP of RMB 480 based on lowered 28x FY23E PE (vs 30x prior for soft consume electronics
market) We believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver strong earnings growth market share gain and
product expansion to capture Apple and NEV opportunities in next 3-5 years
weaker iPhoneAirPods demand weaker yield improvement and slower integration of acquired businesses
