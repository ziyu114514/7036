China Consumer  Positive
takeaway from FB distributors
but sectors bull-run could take a
breather from here  31 Jan 2023
CR Beer (291 HK)  Another
positive year for 2023 our
preferred pick for Chinas re-
opening  22 Jan 2023
China Feihe (6186 HK)  Looks to
be a beta play within 1H23 when
birth rate likely starts inflecting

UpDownside
 Moutai released its 1Q preliminary financial data that beat expectation with
revenue net profits growing by 1819% respectively The data tracked above
the 15% management guidance given for the numbers for the full year of
2023 We attribute the strength mainly to the incremental sales growth from
iMoutai and a strong premiumization effort
 We view this positively and we think this shall help dispel concern on a
weak March sales momentum that spread out from the recent Wine Fair
(糖酒会) Of note the news triggered sector share prices to down by c3%
last Monday (10 April)
 Our recent channel check with distributors indicated that wholesales
pricing for sealed Feitian Moutai per bottle has recovered to about
RMB2950 (from the low of RMB2900 in March) Going forward we see
scope for pricing to recover further as channel inventory should ease
over a more festive 2Q which clusters with the 51 and the Dragon Boat
 Earnings change We maintain our forecasts for now
 Moutai is our strong Buy that benefits from Chinas reopening theme
within our FB coverage universe
 Valuation Our TP is based on 410x end-23E PE which represents long-term
average since 2019 Our methodology reflects our relative optimism (vis-a-vis
other FB diversified of which target multiples are based on -1sd below long
term average) that Moutai is one of the core beneficiaries standing at the
forefront of Chinas reopening with high certainty in earnings support
