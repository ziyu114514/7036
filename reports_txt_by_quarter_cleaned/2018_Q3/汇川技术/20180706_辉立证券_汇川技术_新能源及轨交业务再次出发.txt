收入快速增長，淨利穩定提升的良好態勢正在持續
匯川技術2017 年營業收入為4777 億元，同比增長305%，歸屬股東淨利潤同比增長
138%至 1060 億元，實現 EPS 064 元，業績略低於我們預期，主要因為新能源客車市
場受政策調整影響程度大於預期；綜合毛利率4512%，同比下滑3 個百分點，主要系
業務結構變化、市場競爭加劇及部分原材料價格上漲等原因。期間費用率上升23 個
百分點，主要由於加大新業務的研發和建設。
2018 年一季度，公司營業收入同比增長 247%至 975 億元，歸屬股東淨利潤同比增長
139%至 1965 億元，實現 EPS 012 元。毛利率方面，公司通過不斷加大核心技術研發
力度，持續推出高毛利率新品以及行業深度解決方案，以保持公司產品綜合毛利率的
穩定，毛利率下降程度減緩至1 個百分點，為4554%。
從產品結構來看，公司各業務進展情況不一：
根據工控網資料，2017 年中國工業自動化市場規模同比增長 165%，其中變頻器類產
品同比增長 13%左右，PLCHMI 產品同比增長超過 20%，運動控制類產品同比增長超
過 25%。受益於中國設備製造業和專案型市場的結構性復蘇，公司的工業自動化業務
在 2017 年憑藉出色的解決方案與品牌影響力，取得了高品質的市場表現，變頻器類
伺服類控制技術類2017 年的營收分別同比增長34%86%96%，毛利率分別同比提升-
27-06095 個百分點。

2017 年全球機器人產業呈高速發展態勢，產業規模與市場空間不斷擴大，中國
市場工業機器人銷量 136 萬台，同比增長達到 60%。公司的工業機器人產品在
手機製造等行業均已實現批量銷售，工業機器人、南京匯川（工業視覺）、上
海萊恩（高精密絲杠）合計實現收入 083 億元，同比增長 184 倍。
我們預計2018 年中國的工控行業高增長勢頭有望繼續，同時我們認為，中國工
業機器人應用市場潛力正逐漸步入快速釋放階段，2018 年工業機器人市場同比
增速可達40%，公司的工業自動化業務有望繼續快速增長。2017 年公司智慧裝
備機器人的新簽訂單達到456 億元，同比增長434%，2018 年一季度，公司
新簽訂單 1158 億元，同比增長 297%。
公司的新能源軌交類業務2017 年收入同比下滑6%，毛利率降低8 個百分點，
主要由於新能源客車補貼政策調整，2017 年中國的新能源客車市場大幅下滑
14%。受累于主要客戶宇通客車銷量下滑74%，公司的新能源客車收入因而出
現下滑，但公司的新能源物流車業務開始批量銷售，抵消了部分負面影響。我
們預計隨著補貼政策過渡期結束，匯川的新能源客車業務將步出穀底，而新能
源物流車業務將迎來爆發。
由於地鐵項目建設週期和收入確認原因，2017 年公司軌道交通業務僅確認收入
1 億元，同比下滑 56%。目前公司在手軌交訂單超過13 億，隨著項目的交付和
確認收入，預計公司未來三年軌交業務收入將達到53、63、7 億元左右，強力
