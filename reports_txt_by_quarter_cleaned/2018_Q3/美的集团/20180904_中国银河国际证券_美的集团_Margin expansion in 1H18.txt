MIDEA GROUP 000333CH Margin expansion in 1H18
Midea reported a strong set of interim results with topbottom line growing by
150%  197% respectively led by strong results in air conditioning While
interim results were strong investors are focused on potential deterioration in
top line AC and consumer appliances during 2H18 We have cut our 2018  2019
EPS by 37%  104% and reduce our target price from RMB 63 to RMB 53 to
account for softening top line growth and lack of near term positive catalysts
Investment Highlights
Upgrade trend intact Mideas gross margins increased from 255% in 1H17 to
expanding gross margins in a rising raw material price environment (Figures 2-4)
Midea expects gross margins to further improve in 2H18
Strong 1H but deteriorating momentum Midea Gree and Qingdao Haier all
experienced slipping AC sales growth in July due to high base effect and
with our channel checks Overall however we think weak July air conditioner
sales and Little Swans Q3 2018 sales guidance for flat YoY growth may be a
Low channel inventory Mideas AC inventory remains well controlled with 1-2
million units In other appliance segments Midea also reports that channel
inventory is near historical lows While we believe there is a high probability of
revenue deceleration in 2H18 we dont believe AC industry channel inventory
levels are reminiscent of 2015 levels when destocking led to price wars
Presently all three major appliance manufacturers report low channel
inventories
Inexpensive valuation While we cannot discount a slowdown in consumer
demand in 2H18 and 2019 Midea is best positioned among all home
manufacturers to weather a downturn With 35% sales from international
sources (ex KUKA) and lower ASPs relative to Gree and Qingdao Haier Midea
remains well situated to ride out a slowdown in Chinas home appliance market
Currently trading at 119x 2019E PER we expect Midea to post 20%11% EPS
growth in 20182019 down from our former estimates of 25%19% EPS growth
Our 20182019 earnings have been reduced by 37%104% respectively Our
new TP is based on a valuation of 15x 2019 EPS which we believe is justifiable
for a business with a diversified franchise stable market share and teens
