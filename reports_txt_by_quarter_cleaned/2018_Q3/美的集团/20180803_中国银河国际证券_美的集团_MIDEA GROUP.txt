MIDEA GROUP 000333CH
2018 H1 sales should be in line with full-year expectations in view of strong
domestic demand for ACs refrigerators and washing machines Slower
growth is expected for KUKA and kitchen appliance sales Notwithstanding
new US tariffs we expect Midea to see some improvement in export sales in
2018 H2 and into 2019 due to RMB weakness We reduce our target price
from RMB67 to RMB63 to account for a softening macro backdrop and the
delayed product launch of Mideas high-end brand
Investment Highlights
AC sales expected to support 2018 H1 We expect Mideas HVAC to grow
40% YoY with refrigerator and washing machines growing 20% YoY
Kitchen appliance growth is tracking in the single digits as Midea prudently
withheld shipments to distributors with high inventory levels in H1 KUKA is
also experiencing lower-than-expected growth in Q2 because of the weak
auto market but is expected to deliver better results in H2
Trade war concerns overblown In 2017 Midea exported US2bn of
goods to the US or approximately 5% of overall sales Of the Companys
US2bn in exports only US200-250m may be affected by Trumps first
we understand an additional US400m of Midea exports would be affected
Mideas exports to benefit from RMB depreciation As one of Chinas
larger exporters of home appliances the recent RMB weakness will support
However the impact will be moderated by the fact that a significant portion
of Mideas international sales are produced in Brazil Vietnam and other
countries We estimate that 5% RMB depreciation will benefit Mideas 2019
PBT by 4%
Net Forex assets imply potential translation gain As of Dec 2017
Midea held RMB4bn of net USD exposure and RMB32bn of Euro debt
exposure We understand that most of its Euro debt is hedged and estimate
that single digit RMB depreciation from Dec 2017 levels would result in
minimal translation gain
Inexpensive Valuation Currently trading at 118x 2019E PER Midea is on
track to deliver 10-15% revenue growth in 2018 H1 versus our full-year
expectation of 14% growth We trim our 2019 earnings by 6% on account
of i) the delayed launch of Mideas high-end brand and ii) a weaker macro
backdrop which may negatively impact 2019 estimates Our new TP of
RMB63 is based on 16x 2019 EPS which we believe is justifiable for a
business with a diversified franchise and earnings growth above 20%

Net impact of Mideas Forex Liabilities can be Material
As of Dec 2017 Mideas forex cash and debt amounted to RMB134bn and RMB356bn respectively
Much of this debt was Euro-denominated debt inherited from the KUKA acquisition which we
understand was mostly hedged We estimate that Midea has forex exposure of RMB25bn
Consequently Midea will be positively affected by weakness in the RMB exchange rate though this
reported earnings Fluctuation in the EURUSD exchange rate will also affect the gain
Nevertheless as Figure 1 shows a 5% depreciation of the RMB against the USD Euro and other
currencies since the beginning of the year will result in a translation loss of RMB 130m or less than 1%
of Mideas 2018 PBT Fluctuation in the EURUSD exchange rate will affect the sensitivity

Exports to Benefit from RMB Depreciation
In 2017 Midea booked RMB104bn out of 241bn of sales in international markets This figure
included KUKAs sales as well as sales from Mideas factories outside of China Midea operates
manufacturing plants in Brazil Argentina Italy Belarus Egypt India Thailand Vietnam and Japan
Direct sales to the US are only 5% of Mideas overall revenue with most products going to the local
markets in which they are produced
To adjust for these factors we subtracted the impact of Kukas sales and adjust for the fact that the
remaining international sales are either local sales or priced in currencies which may not benefit from
USD strength According to our estimates we see RMB depreciation of 5% from Dec 2017 levels
benefiting Mideas 2019 PBT by 4%
