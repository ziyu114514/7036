把握云5G资本开支机遇的光通信收发模块龙头企业 
中际旭创是领先的光通信收发模块（可令数据通过光缆传输的设备）
企业，2017年在全球拥有约5%的市场份额。目前公司已成为谷歌、
亚马逊、阿里巴巴和腾讯等云方案提供商的主要供应商，并将于2019
年率先推出下一代400G产品。同时，公司还将积极参与5G移动通信
市场，其产品已经获得华为和中兴通讯的认可。我们预计云和5G双
重资本开支引擎将推动行业增长，而中际旭创将凭借强大的研发能
力、领先的封装技术以及产品的快速更新继续扩大市场份额。
但关税不确定因素令我们将该股评为中性
由于美国客户对中际旭创总收入的贡献为60%左右，我们认为如果美
国加征关税，则公司盈利将受到重大影响。尽管我们的预测中尚未计
入任何关税因素，但根据我们的情景分析（其中对中际旭创主要供应
商进行了压力测试），我们估算：
关税加征10%将令公司20181920年每股盈利减少
12%16%2%；
关税加征25%将令公司20181920年每股盈利减少
18%30%12%
12个月目标价人民币46元，体现了关税不确定因素
鉴于关税不确定性，我们以中际旭创历史谷底估值倍数20倍乘以
2019年预期每股盈利人民币229元，得出12个月目标价人民币为46
元。我们还进行了不同的情景分析，包括根据高盛美国宏观经济团队
的预测，对加征25%关税的情景赋予70%的概率，并对不加征关税的
情景赋予30%的概率，这一方法得出的估值为人民币43元。

PM Summary Waiting for the light
Founded and headquartered in Suzhou in 2008 Innolight researches designs builds
and markets high-speed optical transceiver modules - devices that enable the
transmission of data via optical fiber cable With c5% global market share as of 2017
Innolight is already a top supplier to cloud providers like Google Amazon Alibaba and
Tencent and will be one of the first to provide next generation 400G products in 2019 At
products already qualified by Huawei and ZTE
With US exports accounting for c60% of current total revenue and all of its
manufacturing facilities in China we believe potential US tariffs would have a material
impact on earnings While we dont incorporate any tariffs into our estimates based on
our scenario analysis that includes stress-testing Innolights top suppliers we see
a 10% tariff to reduce EPS by 12%16%2%(18E19E20E)
a 25% tariff to reduce EPS by 18%30%12%(18E19E20E)
Competitive Advantages
1 Superior RD strength
Stable management team with rich experience in RD
Industry-leading packaging technologies
2 Fast decision making and product refresh cycle
Concentrated RD focus on packaging technology
Industry-leading manufacturing facilities and experienced production personnel
Strategic relationship with upstream chip makers and sub-module suppliers
Trust building with key customers
3 Best-in-class operational efficiency
Lower RD and SGA costs vs overseas peers
Higher gross profit margin vs domestic peers
fixed-line network transport network and access network (FTTH) and wireless network
(eg 4G 5G)
中际旭创 (300308SZ)
The main drivers of the growth are (1) increasing demand for data center services (2)
continued penetration of fiber used in new-built data centers and (3) optical transceiver
data rate upgrade in the newly built data centers
at a 39% CAGR from 2018 to 2022 arriving at 17 billion (1) We forecast that the
global 5G base station will reach around 12 million units in 2027 (the end of the 5G
cycle) double the number of the total 4G base stations due to shorter coverage area (2)
25G and 100G optical transceiver modules will be the mainstream choice for the 5G
fronthaul transmission network vs 10G modules for 4G network
We believe Innolights 100G and 400G transceiver modules will be the key growth
rate transceiver modules Going forward 100G and 400G transceiver modules will be
the mainstream choice in our view for the data center accesscore layer networks and
5G fronthaulbackhaul networks
Innolight also has superior ROE than the majority of its global peers below industry
average cash conversion cycle with low and stable financial leverage We see healthy
and growing free cash flow over the next three years
Given uncertainty around tariffs we apply Innolights trough multiple of 20X to 2019E
EPS of Rmb229 to arrive at 12-month target price of Rmb46 implying 9% upside and
therefore we initiate at Neutral We also explore different scenarios with the potential
tariff and different multiples (detailed further inside) and a probability weighted
theoretical value Scenarios
No tariff Rmb69 (based on 30X PE on 2019E EPS of Rmb229) 64% upside
10% tariff Rmb48 (based on 25X PE on 2019E EPS of Rmb193) 14% upside
25% tariff Rmb32 (based on 20X PE on 2019E EPS of Rmb161) 24% downside
Our US macro team assigns a 70% chance of tariff implementation with 25% on
non-consumer products and an eventual deal to be reached in 12 months time
Based on this for one scenario we apply a 70% probability to a 25% tariff scenario (20X
PE)  a 30% probability to no tariff scenario (30X PE) to derive an implied value of
Stronger or weaker demand from cloud and 5G capex

Scenario Analysis Potential US tariff impact and stress-testing the
With US exports accounting for around 60% of Innolights current total revenue and all
of its manufacturing facilities located in China we believe potential tariffs on US imports
from China as proposed by the White House would have a material impact on earnings if
enacted as optical transceiver modules are subject to the proposed tariff Therefore we
conduct a scenario analysis and stress-testing on Innolights top suppliers to better
understand the potential change in estimates should the White House move forward with
tariffs although note we do not incorporate any tariffs into our actual estimates given
tariffs have not been implemented
We conduct one scenario assuming tariffs are 25% in line with our US macro team
which assigns a 70% chance of tariff implementation with 25% on non-consumer
products and an eventual deal to be reached in 12 months time
We also conduct a scenario assuming tariffs are 10% given this was the original
proposed tariff before the White House lifted the proposal to 25%

1 Among COGS 65% of the value is for optical and electrical chips which are
hard to find alternative suppliers
of its tariff to its suppliers
3 We analyzed Innolights top 5 suppliers in 2014-2016 and estimate 3 out
of 5 are able to sustain a 5%-10% price cut
Scenario 2 25% tariff
In this case because it would be more severe we believe Innolight would need to
use a non-China OEM to manufacture their US shipments to avoid the tariffs similar
to some of its global peers
in 2018E2019E2020E due to the costs of outsourcing
Assumptions
1 Revenue will be unchanged since Innolight would use a non-China OEM to
manufacture their US shipments
1 Innolights US demand are mostly 100G modules with c28% gross
2 Assume OEM produced gross margin will be 5% lower (ie 23%) and OEM
will add a 10% cost margin
3 Gross margin for 100G modules will be lowered to 15% when outsourced
Stress-testing Innolights top suppliers
We analyzed the gross margin and net margin sensitivity for Innolights top 5
suppliers over 2014-2016 (supplier names for 2017 not disclosed by Innolight) to
estimate if Innolight could theoretically pass on some of the tariff pressure to its
Mitsubishi Electric (covered by Ikuo Matsuhashi) Suzhou Agix (838112OC traded
(covered by Mark Delaney) Using this historical data we believe 3 out of 5 of these
suppliers in theory could sustain a 5%-10% price cut based on our sensitivity
analysis below meaning Innolight could past on tariff pressure to those in our view
By using simple maths and historical data and holding everything else steady we
a 15%-35% net margin even after a 5% price cut and those margins would still be
hand have relatively thinnegative margins and thus would probably be less likely to
be able to take price cuts

growth reaching Rmb 277 mn in 2017 Innolight had an RDsales ratio of 7% in
2017 trailing that of its global peers thanks to lower personnel costs in Mainland
China Innolights RDsales ratio was in line with its domestic peers in 2017 but
was ahead most of them in terms of absolute values (only Accelink spent more in
RD than Innolight among domestic firms as Accelink is vertically integrated)
Industry-leading packaging technologies
According to the management Innolight is the first in the industry to introduce
non-hermetic packaging technology (COB) in data center optical transceiver
modules Compared with hermetic packaging non-hermetic packaging enables cost
reduction lower production precision requirement and less physical space which is
ideal for data center applications
and specifically its free space coupling technology According to a patent filed in
increase its coupling error tolerance from 02um to around 1um significantly
leading-edge solutions require expertise and intellectual property across numerous
disciplines including active and passive optical device design systems-level analog
and mixed-signal integrated circuit design and optical device integration and

than 8 years of experience and over 5 years experience in the optical
production management and efficiency Innolight has also invested heavily in
automated production and testing lines Currently Innolight has 16 production lines
and 160 fully automated testing systems Combining its main RD and
quickly to market changes
Strategic relationship with upstream chip makers and sub-module suppliers
partnerships with major upstream chip and sub-module suppliers in various locations
including North America Japan and mainland China In addition Innolight has a
joint-design-manufacture collaboration with Google for 100G data center optical
transceiver modules As part of the collaboration Google purchases customized
chips from a third party supplier and sells the chips to Innolight The collaboration will
also help to stabilize chip supply as Google has an aligned interest with Innolight
and much higher bargaining power in the industry
Trust building with key customers
Innolight has overseas branches and distribution partners in multiple worldwide
locations including US EU Japan South Korea Russia and Israel The local
presence helps Innolight to better understand its customer needs and thus allows
transceiver module supplier to Google Amazon Alibaba Huawei and Tencent and
tested and certified by Huawei and ZTE enabling Innolight to tap into the 5G mobile
technology market once the construction cycle starts
3 Best-in-class operational efficiency
Lower RD and SGA costs vs overseas peers
(ex RD) and RD cost ratios From 2013  2017 Innolights RD cost ratio and
its SGA (ex RD) cost ratio is cc 8% and cc 5% lower than its overseas peers
This is largely attributable to much lower personnel cost in China vs US Based on
around Rmb 850000 per annum based in the US while it will only cost around Rmb
500000 for Innolight
中际旭创 (300308SZ)
Higher gross profit margin vs domestic peers
Unlike most of its domestic peers Innolights product portfolio is relatively
high-end with 40G100G optical transceiver module products accounting for 89% of
players Therefore the pricing pressure on the low end is relatively high putting
pressure on the GP margin Due to technology barriers most of Innolights
domestic peers do not have the mass production capability for 100G transceiver
modules with a high yield rate as Innolight does enabling Innolight to achieve a
intense As Innolights SGA level is in line with its domestic peers its net profit
margin outperforms most of its peers

sector to grow at 20% CAGR between 2018 and 2022 reaching 58 billion The main
drivers of the growth are (1) increasing demand for data center services (2) continued
penetration of fiber used in new-built data centers and (3) optical transceiver data rate
upgrade in the newly built data centers
(1)  According to the Cisco Global Cloud Index the global data center traffic will reach
206 Zettabytes by 2021 representing a 25% CAGR from 2016 to 2021 The trend is
mainly driven by new applications such as 4K8K streaming ARVR and autonomous
driving which have high bandwidth requirements The increase of data traffic triggers a
higher demand for optical fiber connections which can transmit data at a higher speed

(2)  In 2016 around 90% of the DCs in China used the traditional three-layer structure
which hardly requires fiber connections at the access layer (between servers and
top-of-rack switches) However starting in 2013 with the advent of the two-layer
increasing west to east (between-server) traffic within data centers will start to use
all-fiber connections in the access layers significantly boosting data center optical
transceiver usage (4 vs 0 per server) To cope with the increasing demand data center
service providers like Google Amazon Apple Facebook Microsoft and Alibaba are
also steadily increasing their investment in hyperscale data centers According to Cisco
the number of global hyperscale data centers will increase from 338 in 2016 to 628 in
(3)  Lastly we noticed that in new generation data centers 10G25G40G transceivers
are replacing 125G transceivers that were used between servers and switches and
connections In the future data centers are planning to adopt 400G and even higher
data rate optical transceivers driving the ASP growth

CAGR from 2018 to 2022 arriving at 17 billion The growth is mainly driven by the
use in 2020 in China We forecast that the global 5G base station will reach around 12
million units in 2027 (the end of the 5G cycle) double the number of the total 4G base
stations due to shorter coverage area This will significantly push up the volume demand
In the 5G era data transmission speed will be greatly increased According to China
Mobile 5G data transmission speed will reach 15Gbps 10X that of 4G The data rate
increase is achieved by using higher speed transceiver modules 25G and 100G optical
transceiver modules will be the mainstream choice for the 5G fronthaul transmission
network vs 10G modules for 4G network while 100G 200G and 400G will be widely

Valuation 12-month target price of Rmb46 reflects tariff
We believe PE is the key valuation metric investors focus on for Innolight as it takes
into account all the revenue and cost elements affecting earnings (cost structure capital
structure effective tax rate FX etc) and also reflects profit making ability This is also in
line with our valuation methodology for the A-share tech space
We forecast 34% revenue and 47% EPS CAGR for Innolight over 2018E-2020E and
apply a 20X PE multiple on 2019E EPS of Rmb229 to reflect our cautious view amid
trade uncertainties Our 12-month target price of Rmb46 implies 9% upside and
therefore we initiate at Neutral
Potential positive catalysts over the next twelve months include
Volume shipment of 400G products in 2019 Innolight is already shipping in small
volumes to Google and Amazon
passed Huawei and ZTEs testing and is shipping in small volumes to them now
average of 30X since 3Q17 when it was acquired by Zhongji Equipment Considering
Innolights above industry revenueearnings CAGR we believe 30X is reasonable
under normal circumstances vs current global peer average of 23X while we choose
25X for our 10% tariff scenario as this is the midpoint multiple between our No tariff
(30X) and 25% tariff (20X) scenarios
We also explore different scenarios with the potential tariff and a probability weighted
theoretical value
No tariff Rmb69 (based on 30X PE on 2019E EPS of Rmb229) 64% upside
10% tariff Rmb48 (based on 25X PE on 2019E EPS of Rmb193) 14% upside
25% tariff Rmb32 (based on 20X PE on 2019E EPS of Rmb161) 24% downside
Our US macro team assigns a 70% chance of tariff implementation with 25% on
non-consumer products and an eventual deal to be reached in 12 months time
Based on this we assign a 70% probability to 25% tariff scenario  a 30% probability to
no tariff scenario to derive an implied value of Rmb2970%Rmb6930%Rmb43 In
terms of forecasts we use the no tariff scenario given there has been no
implementation to date and will adjust to the tariff level should the tariffs actually be
implemented
Quotes from US macro team
While a number of details are uncertain to Trump Administrations proposed
US200bn in additional tariffs on China our Washington team expects the White
中际旭创 (300308SZ)
House to move forward with these tariffs imposing a rate of 10% on consumer
goods and 25% on other (industrialintermediate) products
While the outlook is uncertain we expect the White House to move forward with
tariffs on the majority of the next round of 200bn in imports proposed in July (70%
chance) We expect that the recently proposed 25% tariff rate (up from the earlier
proposed 10% rate) will be applied to a subset of the 200bn of targeted imports
However the decision here is likely to rest in part on whether the recent CNY
depreciation has reversed or continued by the time the decision is made likely in
September
We now see USDCNY weakening further past the psychologically important level of
700 towards 690 and 710 in 3 and 6 months respectively but a reversion to 660
in 12 months as an eventual deal still seems to us as a reasonable base case
assumption

Key risks demand tariff and Silicon Photonics
1 Stronger or weaker demand from cloud and 5G capex
Our 34% revenue CAGR (2018E-202E) forecast for Innolight is based on resilient
demand from both datacenter expansion and 5G rollout starting in 2H19 If the global
datacenter spending accelerates due to fast growth of global data traffic demand or
slowdown in certain markets Innolight may experience a faster or slower growth
trajectory than what we expect same is true if China or global 5G rollout progress is
domestic customers demand and 70% from overseas Innolight now has very little
customers
2 Uncertainties around tariff implementation
Amid the uncertainties around ongoing trade war between the United States and China
the US has announced a second batch of US200bn tariff plans at a rate of either 10%
or 25% which may take effect later this year Optical transceiver modules will be subject
to the second batch of tariffs On Sep 7th the Wall Street Journal reported Trump
ready to roll with yet more tariffs hitting 267bn in Chinese goods On Sep 12th the
Wall Street Journal reported US Proposing New Round of Trade Talks With China
before the US200bn tariff goes into effect Whether the tariffs will be implemented
eventually and at what rate will they be implemented pose both upside and downside
risks to Innolights fundamental business as well as share price For more details

Silicon Photonics is an emerging technology that uses semiconductor-grade silicon as
the platform for the integration of active and passive photonic circuits along with
using existing semiconductor fabrication techniques resulting in high-volume production
invest into the space and made visible progress
Advantages of Silicon Photonics
System integration Silicon photonics IC integrates waveguides modulator detector
and demux onto one single chip According to Finisar over 84% of the functions are
integrated with high yield at wafer level in a Si fab As silicon photonic chips are
addition the small size of a silicon photonic chip also leads to improved chip density
Low cost Conventional VCSEL DML and EML chips use InP or GaAs as raw
material  Per inch InP costs around 88 and GaAs costs around 55 In
from sand which only costs around 25 per inch
Low power consumption The first generation of CFP2 100G transceiver modules
module using silicon photonic chip only uses around 35 watts an 85% improvement
from the conventional module mainly driven by the high level of integration and
Scalability  Silicon photonics chips have the capability to incorporate Wavelength
Division Multiplexing (WDM) optics Currently 100G data rate is achieved by using 4
channels of 25G lasers at different wavelengths With WDM Silicon photonics
optical transceiver can transmit up to 40 channels of light at different wavelengths
coupling to a single strand of optical fiber
Major challenges faced in the 100G optical transceiver market
In 2015 Luxtera unveiled its 100G PSM4 optical transceiver module supporting
transmission distance of up to 2km In 2016 Intel for the first time announced the
transceiver module products in both PSM4 and CWDM4 specifications with transmission
beginning Silicon Photonics 100G products face several challenges from conventional
For very short reach links (100m) VCSEL materially outperforms Silicon Photonics
in all performance metrics (costpower consumptiondensity)
with conventional DML products in both PSM4 and CWDM4 specifications
Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 transceiver module is a relatively mature
product taking up around 50% of the overall 100G PSM4 market share
中际旭创 (300308SZ)
However as PSM4 structure uses 70% more fibers than CWDM4 structure
the overall market share for PSM4 products is shrinking with CWDM4
For 100G CWDM4 products Silicon Photonics transceiver module still has not
achieved volume production due to production yield and product reliability
issues (coupling error separate laser problem low economies of scale for
CMOS and immature upstream supply chain)
MA rank for Innolight
Across our global coverage we examine stocks using an MA framework considering
both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and
acquisition target 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low
rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target and
may or may not be discussed in research
We have previously examined our Asia Pacific technology coverage using an MA
framework (see Navigating the noise (6) Introduce MA framework update
targets and rank them from 1 to 3 based on our assessment of three key factors
Firstly we look at whether there are any impediments such as shareholder
structurepreferences industry regulationsgovernment policies and takeover defense
strategies that could prevent a transaction from occurring We then consider four
qualitative factors  attractiveness of technology attractiveness of customers cost
synergy potential and otherintangible value  and two quantitative factors  market
cap and valuations
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
When assessing potential impediments we take into consideration
       Major shareholder preferences (we assume that shareholders with a 20% or
greater stake have significant influence or a blocking stake) and take into account any
potential actions by major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third
party (including whether they would likely be receptive or if they may be opposed to
中际旭创 (300308SZ)
       Regulatory and or government policy impediments and
       Possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill
We assign a No qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are
applicable and a Yes qualification if these considerations do not apply
Four qualitative assessment criteria
capable of generating future value as well as its technological capabilities and
intellectual property rights We assign a rank of 3 if its technology is unattractive
2 if it is moderately attractive and 1 if it is very attractive
base and product applications We also take customer retention and end-market
exposure (including sales channels) into account We assign a rank of 3 if its
customer base and product applications are unattractive 2 if they are moderately
attractive 1 if they are attractive
       Cost synergies We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for
rank of 3 if there is low possibility of synergies 2 if there is some possibility 
1 if there is high possibility
including brand strength outstanding managementemployees and intangible assets
We assign a rank of 3 if they are unattractive 2 if they are moderately
attractive 1 if they are attractive
Two quantitative assessment criteria
easier it is to acquire We also take regional qualities (such as differing market cap
ranges between regions) into account
EVDACF are below the industrypeer average for the same period as we believe
peer group 2 if its valuation is in line with the peer average 1 if its valuation
is discounted We take into account differing valuation multiple ranges between the

投资摘要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与其行业和市场相比较来评价该股的投资环境。所描述的四个主要指标包括增长、回报、估值倍数和波动性。增
长、回报和估值倍数都是运用数种方法综合计算而成，以确定该股在地区研究行业内所处的百分位排名。
每项指标的准确计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法如下：
增长是下一年预测与当前年度预测的综合比较，如每股盈利、EBITDA 和收入等。 回报是各项资本回报指标一年预测的加总，如CROCI、平均运用资本
回报率和净资产回报率。 估值倍数根据一年预期估值比率综合计算，如市盈率、股息收益率、EVFCF、EVEBITDA、EVDACF、市净率。 波动性根据
12个月的历史波动性计算并经股息调整。
在我们的全球覆盖范围中，我们使用并购框架来分析股票，综合考虑定性和定量因素（各行业和地区可能会有所不同）以计入某些公司被收购的可能性。
然后我们按照从1到3对公司进行并购评分，其中1分代表公司成为并购标的的概率较高(30%-50%)，2分代表概率为中等(15%-30%)，3分代表概率较低
(0%-15%)。对于评分为1或2的公司，我们按照研究部统一标准将并购因素体现在我们的目标价格当中。并购评分为3被认为意义不大，因此不予体现在
