GREE ELECTRIC 000651CH
Gree is benefitting from recent strong domestic demand for air conditioning
and we expect the Company to report a strong performance for 2018H1
Recent RMB weakness also benefits Gree We remain cautious on Gree
however due low visibility on AC sales in 2018H2 its single-product single-
market focus the lack of new discernible earnings drivers and an
inconsistent growth strategy
Investment Highlights
Anticipating strong 2018H1 performance Due to hot weather lean
inventory levels and a resilient property market all AC manufacturers in
China are seeing strong sales growth Gree is guiding revenue of RMB
200bn in 2018 versus consensus estimates of RMB 177bn We expect
Gree to achieve sales of RMB95bn in 2018H1 or 34% YoY growth
Trade war concerns overblown We estimate that 20% of Grees exports
or RMB3bn in 2017 were exported to the United States This is equivalent
to 2% of Grees total sales in 2017
USD holdings to result in currency gains As of Dec 2017 Gree held
US65bn in cash against US15bn in debt We estimate that 5% RMB
depreciation since Dec 2017 will result in a translation gain of RMB18bn
before tax or a 6% increase in Grees 2018E PBT However this is a one-
off gain which should not result in a re-rating of the stock
Grees exports will benefit from USD strength While the 2018H1 results
should have been negatively affected by the relatively strong RMB in most of
2018H1 recent RMB exchange rate fluctuations should have an impact in
2018H2 We estimate that 5% RMB depreciation will increase Grees
2018H2 PBT by RMB200m or 07% of 2018Es PBT The impact should
be greater in 2019
Fair Valuation Gree is on track for solid revenue growth in 2018H1 and its
low valuation coupled with an interim dividend announcement may result in
near-term outperformance Although the Company may benefit from RMB
weakness the impact is not sufficiently large to justify a re-rating In spite of
a strong 2018H1 top line we remain cautious about 2018H2 in light of low
visibility on AC sales the lack of new discernible long-term growth drivers
and an inconsistent corporate strategy We believe Gree warrants a discount
relative to its peers Haier and Midea and value the Company at 95x 2019
earnings implying a 12-month target price of RMB48 or 85% upside

Impact of Grees USD Holdings
As of Dec 2017 Gree held US465bn in cash against US15bn in debt The net USD position was
reported as the equivalent of RMB354bn Changes in the USDRMB exchange rate will create
translation gainslosses that will accrue to net profit We estimate that 5% RMB depreciation since Dec
2017 will result in a translation gain of RMB18bn before tax or a 6% increase in Grees 2018E PBT

Exports to Benefit from RMB Depreciation
In 2017 Gree booked RMB184bn out of RMB150bn in sales to international markets We
understand that Gree currently operates one manufacturing plant outside of China On this basis we
estimate the majority of Grees total international sales are exports originating from mainland China
Theoretically the appreciation of the USD for exports may result in higher revenues while overall
RMB-based costs remain stable
The benefits accruing to Gree from export revenue will be adjusted since (i) only 20% of Grees
exports are to the US market So while the majority of Grees exports are priced in USD local
currency depreciation in end markets may limit Grees ability to hold fixed prices in USD and (ii)
currency fluctuation in the past two months will mainly affect sales in 2018H2 and 2019
We sought to ascertain Grees higher profitability from RMB depreciation Based on our estimates
we see RMB depreciation of 5% from Dec 2017 levels benefiting Grees PBT by RMB 200m in
2018H2 or 07% of 2018Es PBT The impact on 2019 will be greater due to the full-year impact
