Gree 000651CH Potential slowdown in 2H18
Gree reported a strong set of interim results with revenue and EPS growing by
314% and 342% respectively led by strong results in air conditioning At present
investor concern is focused on deteriorating China AC sales growth in July  August
We believe top line concerns are likely to pressure the stock into 2H18 and we trim
our 2018  2019 EPS estimates by 57%  114% and reduce our target price from
RMB 48 to RMB 426 to account for softening top line growth
Investment Highlights
80% of total sales grew 388% YoY Gree indicated that sales growth was faster in
Tier 34 cities for the period In spite of strong top line growth gross margins in the
AC segment contracted 410bps on account of increased raw materials prices and
low utilization at a new Changsha factory Gree negated the impact of gross margin
which may prove unsustainable in our view
AC growth decelerating in 2H18 Midea Gree and Qingdao Haier all experienced
negative growth in AC sales in July due to high base effect and weather We
understand Gree experienced singled digit negative volumesales growth in July due
to high base and weather effect In August negative growth has moderated to
approximately flat growth YoY This trend is consistent with our channel checks and
reporting from other home appliance manufacturers
Dividend disappoints Gree announced a proposed interim dividend of RMB36bn
indicating 30% payout ratio for 1H18 This is less than our and market expectations
of 50% payout and below Grees historical payout ratio of 60-70% Gree has not
provided clear guidance on whether it still intends to pay a delayed dividend on
2017s earnings Gree has also not provided further clarity on where it intends to
invest its cash reserves
Inventory levels under control Grees factory and channel inventory remain
seasonally low according to the Company Similarly channel inventory levels of
Inexpensive valuation In spite of a strong 2018H1 top line we remain cautious
about Grees 2018H2 in light of low visibility on AC sales the lack of new discernible
long-term growth drivers and an inconsistent corporate strategy Gree derives 88%
of its revenue from China making its earnings almost wholly reliant on the domestic
China market On this basis we believe Gree warrants a discount relative to its peers
Haier and Midea We cut our 20182019 EPS estimates by 57%114% and value
the Company at 95x PER implying a 12-month target price of RMB426 or 9%
