Reported sales belie cooling real demand
 Air-conditioner sales growth to moderate on shortfall in demand growth
 Investors likely to focus on end-demand rather than reported revenues
 We raise FY18 and FY19 EPS estimates by 11% and 4% but downgrade
the stock to Neutral and cut our PER-based TP by 24% Rmb3880
 We downgrade Gree to Neutral post 1H18 as we are increasingly cautious on
the air-conditioner industry in 2H18-1H19 given the high YoY base We raise
our earnings est for FY18 by 11% and for FY19 by 4% in view of the strong
reported sales for 1H18 that we believe are due to strong sell-in However we
cut the target PER from 135x FY18E to 9x FY19E Accordingly we lower our
TP by 24% to RMB3880sh as we expect growth to normalise following
strong earnings growth in the past 24 months Our FY18-19 earnings are 4% 
7% below consensus respectively Dividend uncertainty remains a concern
 Air-conditioner sales growth to normalise from 2H18 Grees AC
shipments in China have risen 16% YoY YTD We expect air-conditioner
revenue growth to moderate to 8% YoY in 2H18 after last years unusually
high 49% YoY growth which we believe was partly due to AC demand being
met earlier than expected Our channel checks indicate that weaker-than-
expected July retail sales have led to higher channel inventory for the industry
which will take time to digest This we believe will cause shipment growth to
moderate to relieve pressure on channels
 Would it matter if management can hit RMB 200bn sales target for FY18
will be a share price catalyst as it will only increase the markets scepticism on
whether there is channel stuffing in air-conditioners given the strong sales
revenue growth in the past 24 months We see end-consumer demand
measured by either AC installations or retail sell-through as a much more
important catalyst to the share price than Grees sales to channels
 Investment in chipset design at what cost A key reason for the cut in
dividend is Grees intention to invest in chipset design Its inverter air-
conditioners use mainly imported chipsets that cost RMB4-5bn annually As
itself it is investing in chipset technology RD to increase its pricing power
and control costs Gree has set up a subsidiary with RMB1bn of share capital
Earnings and target price revision
 We raise our reported estimates for FY18 and FY19 by 11% and 4%
respectively but cut our target price by 24% to RMB3880sh

Investment thesis Downgrade to Neutral TP lowered to Rmb3880sh
We lower our target price to Rmb 3880sh from Rmb 5100sh previously as we lower our earnings
multiple on FY19E to 9x despite lifting reported EPS by 11% for FY18E and 4% for FY19E While Gree
remains the leader in Chinas air-conditioner industry by volumes and gains from market consolidation we
worry about the FY19 outlook as we fear the demand for air-conditioners may have been drawn in
advance following strong air-conditioner selling seasons for two consecutive years—2017 and 2018 The
AC selling season starts from August and ends in July next year
 AC industry growth to moderate in 2H18 and 1H19 after two years of solid growth According
believe sell-in volume may still grow in 2H18 but growth is likely to moderate going forward
particularly in 1H19 due to a higher base
 Still seeing ASP increase at retail level Based on 1H18 for All View Cloud (AVC) data Gree
 Dividends Gree has paid out 28% of its 1H18 earnings at RMB 60cents per share which is much
plans to invest in chip design as it wants to save the over RMB4-5 billion that it currently spends
annually on imported chipsets
dividend payout has disappointed the market which remains concerned about the size of investment in
chipset design especially in the context of the broader slowdown in AC sales We lower our multiple to
factor in this uncertainty and will wait on the sidelines for a better entry point

We are raising our reported profit estimates for 2018 and 2019 by 11% and 4% respectively in view of the
stronger than expected results for 1H18 Our FY18 revenue estimate of RMB181bn is below the
managements target of RMB200bn
 Revenue We lift FY18E revenues by 16% and FY19E by 9% as we expect the group to further
drive its AC sell-in into its regional sales office this year to achieve the revenue target of
base in 1H18 which may be reflecting demand spent in advance in our view
 Gross margin We cut our gross margins assumptions for FY18 and FY19 by 20 and 22ppts
diversifies its revenue stream it may see lower margins due to negative impact from a revenue mix
change At the same time we expect gross margin from the export business to get further
 Operating margin We raise our OP margin estimate for FY18 by 10bps but cut it for FY19 by
30bps as we believe Grees efficiency enhancement strict control in selling  distribution expense
will be offset by increased spending on chip design investment which is unlikely to generate near-
term returns
 Dividends We lower our payout ratio assumption for 2018 and beyond to 40% on the back of the
should have more clarity in 2H18

retailers at modern channels and to retailers in lower-tier cities As 70% of AC retail sales happen
between March and August generally retailers need to stock up ACs ahead of time before the peak
season since supply during the peak season is generally not enough to meet demand
We believe part of the discrepancy can be accounted for as inventory at the sales office to be distributed to
pricing architecture within these regions and balance the interests of the smaller distributors
of credit to Zhejiang Shengxi Yinxing Geli trading Co Ltd (浙江盛世欣兴格力贸易有限公司) from
RMB500m to RMB 1bn due to business environment This can be shown as Gree increasing its support to

1H18 revenue grew 314% YoY to RMB 92bn reaching 51% of full-year consensus or 46% of
managements RMB200bn target Gross margin contracted 19ppt to 308% but operating profit margin
expanded by 70bps to 162% while net profit grew 355% to RMB128bn accounting for 47% of full-year
consensus earnings
 Air conditioners Revenue grew 388% YoY in 1H18 The strength of the first-half results can be
supported by the double-digit shipment growth in air-conditioners Gross margin declined 41ppt to
344% which we believe is due to gross margin pressure from the export segment
 Intelligent equipment Revenue declined 63% to RMB356m however gross margin expanded by
deliver orders to better-quality external customers
 Operating cashflow Operating cashflow increased 146% to RMB89 due to increase in other
cash inflow related to operating activities
 Sales rebate This other current liability amount remains relatively stable down 14% YoY to
RMB592bn
 Advance received from customer This amount declined by 67% YoY and 85% HoH to
higher shipments to distributors and leading to lower balance for customer advances
share of RMB60c representing 28% of 1H18 earnings and below 70% payout in 2015 and 2016
 Quarterly trend On a quarterly basis revenue growth moderated slightly to 30% from 33% in
1Q18 while net profit growth maintained similar momentum at 376% vs 1Q18 at 39%
