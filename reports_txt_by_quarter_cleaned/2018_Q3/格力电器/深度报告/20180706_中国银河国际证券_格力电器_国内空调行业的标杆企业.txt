格力电器 000651CH
格力电器是中国领先的空调制造商，国内市场份额约40。由于公司拥有强
大的品牌、良好的客户忠诚度和较高质量，其产品价格有明显的溢价。格力
受益于近期国内对空调的强劲需求；然而，由于公司的产品和目标市场均较
单一，且缺乏清晰的盈利增长驱动力，再加上未有连贯的增长策略，意味着
公司估值将继续较同业折让。
空调：竞争激化。空调占格力销售额的80以上，另占毛利的90。预计今
年的空调需求将保持强劲，料第一季空调销售额同比增长33，而4 月5 月
的安装量将加快增长。虽然格力的空调产品存在溢价，但其他制造商正在推
出更多高端型号，或会侵占格力的市场份额。
多元化策略未取得重大成功。格力试图多元化其业务，并开拓智能手机、电
动公交车和小家电业务，并且开发出口市场，但未见取得重大成功。这意味
着公司仍是单一产品和单一市场的公司。
公司未有连贯的政策。在格力宣布暂停派发2017 年股息以保留资金作智能制
造、集成电路等新领域的拓展后，其股价一度暴跌。虽然格力可能会在中期
业绩后恢复派息，但市场仍对格力摇摆不定的政策感到忧虑。由于董明珠可
能继续连任主席三年，我们预计管理层的风格不会有任何变化。
充裕的现金状况提供防御性。格力的现金净额为850 亿元人民币（占市值的
32）。我们预计部分现金流将在未来18 个月予以分派，形式将是股票回购
或提高股息。此外，公司还持有约7 亿美元的外汇，因此公司或受益于人民
从近期盈利增长前景看，目前估值估理。格力有望在2018 年上半年实现稳健
的盈利增长，其低估值或导致股价在大盘疲弱时跑赢预期。然而，鉴于格力
的业务有高度的周期性，并依赖于单一产品类别，加上增长策略缺乏明确
性，我们认为格力会较海尔和美的等同业存在折让。我们给予公司的2019 年

Queen of ACes
Gree is the leading air con manufacturer in China with a domestic market
Grees strong brand customer loyalty and quality Gree is benefitting from
recent strong domestic demand for air conditioning however its single-
product single-market focus lack of new discernible earnings drivers and
inconsistent growth strategy mean the Company will continue trading at a
valuation discount to its peers
Investment Highlights
Air Conditioning Encroaching Competition Air conditioners account for
over 80% of Grees sales and 90% of its gross profit AC demand is
expected to remain strong this year with AC sales increasing 33% YoY in
Q1 and installations accelerating in AprilMay While Grees AC products sell
at a premium other manufacturers are introducing more high-end models
which may encroach on Grees turf
Limited Success in Diversification Grees attempts to diversify into
smartphones electric buses and small appliances and to develop export
markets have been met with limited success This means the Company
Inconsistent Corporate Policy Grees share price plummeted when it
announced it would suspend its 2017 dividend to diversify into new fields
such as smart manufacturing integrated circuits and others While Gree will
likely resume dividend payments following interim results the market
remains concerned over Grees wavering policy With Dong Mingzhu likely to
serve as Chairwoman for another three years we do not expect any
changes in management style
Defensive Cash Position Gree has a net cash position of RMB85Bn (32%
of its market cap) We expect some of this cash pile to be distributed either
through share buybacks or in bumper dividends over the next 18 months
In addition the Company also holds around USD 7Bn in forex and may
benefit from RMB depreciation
Fair Valuation in Light of Near-term Earnings Growth Gree is tracking
for solid earnings growth in 2018H1 and its low valuation may result in
outperformance in a stock market downturn However in light of Grees
highly cyclical business reliance on a single product category and lack of
clarity on growth strategy we believe Gree warrants a discount relative to
implying a 12-month target price of RMB 48 or 11% upside

Note  Gree figures based on CGIS forecast
While Grees earnings growth can remain strong in 2018 due to hot weather and strong AC demand this
period of above trend earnings growth may not sustain beyond 2018 We prefer manufacturers with a
more reliable and diversified earnings stream whose EPS growth is higher than Gree
We value Gree at a discount to Haier and Midea on account of the volatile nature of its core air
conditioning business its recent dividend cut and current overhang on the stock due to potential change
in leadership At 9x 2019E PER Grees valuation would be lower than domestic peers but in line with
the international appliance manufacturers such as Electrolux and Whirlpool Gree has historically traded
at a discount to its domestic peers Midea and Qingdao Haier

OVERVIEW AIR CONDITIONING TO DRIVE EARNINGS
Air Conditioning (83% sales)
accounts for 83% of revenue and 94% of gross profit Gree has long tried to diversify into other market
segments but still relies on AC as its main profit driver
Gree has been the leading producer of air conditioners in China since 1995 and in the world since 2005
Grees domestic market share is consistently above 40% by volume Gree also enjoys extremely high
million residential AC sets and over 55 million central AC sets Most of these are sold in China

Chinas AC Market Overview
The air conditioning segment is Grees most important product category representing over 90% of gross
profit Domestically the AC market is dominated by three players Gree Midea and Haier which control
roughly 70% of the market Gree is the leading player in Chinas domestic AC market

2018H1 AC Growth Still Strong
2017 was a boom year for Chinas AC market due to hot weather low channel inventory and a
recovering property market following 2015 lows In volume terms Chinas domestic AC market grew
47% YoY to 89Mn units In the export market AC sales grew 10% to 53Mn units

As of 2018Q1 the air conditioning market in China is continuing to experience strong growth
Gree grew top line revenues 37% in 2018Q1 Gree has seen an acceleration in installations in
April and May over Q1 with installation growth tracking 20% YoY
Mideas air conditioning business grew 40% YoY in 2018Q1 In April Mideas AC growth
decelerated to 20% YoY
Haier AC revenue grew 20% YoY in 2018Q1 with growth accelerating in April and May and
installations tracking
For full year 2018 we expect Grees AC segment to grow 20% YoY Our estimates are more
conservative than management guidance which place sales growth for 2018 at 33%
Grees Industry Leading AC Margins
As a result of its high ASPs and product mix Grees gross margins lead its peers in the AC segment In
our checks with Gome Suning and multi-brand department stores we learned that Gree typically
charges a premium of RMB 200-300 over Midea and Haier for similarly configured AC units Gree has
quiet and energy efficient over their lifespan
Figure 10 AC Gross Margin by Manufacturer
Sources Company Annual Report CGIS Research
In addition to higher ASPs among units with similar specifications our online checks show that Grees
product mix is skewed toward higher ASP models For example Grees top selling units online are
priced RMB 1000-1500 higher than the top sellers for Midea and Haier on TMall Gome and Sunings
online stores

AC Encroaching Competition
margins Other manufacturers however are introducing more high-end models which may weaken
Grees current position
Haier for example has been enjoying success with new high end AC models In 2017 Haier introduced
new air purification series Casarte Yunding and Tianxi According to CMM data Haier increased its
market share in the RMB 4100 price segment by 68 percentage points reaching 105% in 2017 For
residential AC units priced above RMB 8000 Haier increased its market share from 124% to 229%
Furthermore according to Euromonitor data Haier leads globally in smart air conditioning systems with
a 305% market share
Midea is introducing a new premium brand which should roll out in AugustSeptember 2018 The
products will be priced at or above Haiers existing high-end products Casarte In general Midea is
specifically attempting to narrow its pricing gap with Gree in the air conditioning segment While
narrowing this gap by introducing new models which typically sell at a discount to Gree by 300-400
RMB This will put pricing pressure on Grees product offering in our opinion
LIMITED SUCCESS IN DIVERSIFICATION
Gree is still singularly reliant on air conditioners Despite the Companys efforts to diversify its product
range the other products account for only 17% of revenues and 6% of gross profit The Companys
RMB 104Bn
Other Product Offering
Gree controls two brands including GREE and TOSOT for its products The GREE brand is reserved for
and industrial products TOSOT is reserved for Grees small appliances business
Other which includes appliances recycling Since 2011 Gree has established recycling centres
in Shijiazhuang Zhengzhou Tianjin Wuhu and Changsha According to a 2013 White Paper
approximately 100 million electronic appliances were discarded annually in China  including
televisions refrigerators washing machines and air conditioners Gross margins in this business
segment are low averaging 7% from 2016-17
Compressors motors capacitors (3% Sales 2% of Gross Profit) Gree is vertically integrated
customers
Small Appliances (2% Sales 1% of Gross Profit) Gree has attempted to gain traction in the
small appliances market with its TOSOT brand which manufactures fans pressure cookers water
purifiers air purifiers induction cookers dehumidifiers and other kitchen appliances Although
Grees small appliance business is growing it has yet to make a significant impact on the
were RMB 787Mn versus 23Bn in 2017 Over the same period Grees air conditioning business
grew from RMB 55Bn to 123Bn
Smart Equipment (1% sales 1% of Gross Profit) In 2017 Gree introduced a new reporting
segment called smart equipment (1% sales) Grees first smart equipment product however an
AGV was introduced in 2013 To date smart equipment is still a small portion of Grees overall
sales mix The segment currently manufactures industrial robots CNC machines and AGVs
Grees aim is to transition its own manufacturing process toward smart precision manufacturing
Revenue Dependency on China
Gree derives only 12% of its revenue and 4% of its gross profit internationally lower than that of Midea
and Haier While China has recently been experiencing strong demand for AC this year Grees reliance

Grees key international markets include the Middle East as well as Brazil and Pakistan where Gree has
manufacturing plants Around 60% of Grees international appliance sales are from low margin OEM and
ODM products Hence Grees gross margins are significantly higher in Mainland China where all sales
are under its own brands than in the international market

Past efforts at Diversification
Under the leadership of Dong Mingzhu Gree has made several attempts at diversifying into new
business segments to drive growth Gree appears to be targeting high growth businesses which appear
to have only limited synergies with its core AC business
1 Failed Yinlong Acquisition On March 5 2016 Gree proposed to acquire 100% of Yinlong New
Energy by issuing 15Bn shares at 1557 per share (worth RMB 13Bn) and planned to raise not
more than RMB 97Bn by issuing non-public supporting funds However based on Grees balance
sheet at the time Gree had 80Bn in net cash seemingly more than sufficient to acquire Yinlong
without issuing new shares The deal was ultimately vetoed by Grees shareholders However the
acquisition attempt resulted in the suspension of Grees shares for nearly seven months beginning
from February 22 2016 Shares resumed trading in September that year
Dong Mingzhu was a proponent of Yinlongs technology in energy storage equipment (Lithium-ion
battery) After the failed acquisition attempt of Yinlong Dong Mingzhu personally invested into
Yinlong and became the second largest shareholder in April 2017 with 175% stake (worth RMB
2 Struggling Smartphone Business Gree entered the smartphone business in 2015 and so far has
released 2 generations of Gree phones The first generation of Gree phones was launched in early
2015 and a second in June 2016 Sales proved disappointing As of April 2018 the Grees second
generation phone has sold less than 100000 units A 3rd generation of Gree phone is expected to

NO APPARENT UPSIDE IN CORPORATE STRATEGY
Wavering Dividend Policy
Gree has been considered a dividend play by the market on account of its lower PER and high payout
ratio leading to an indicative dividend yield of 5% In April 2018 Gree declared zero dividend for 2017
results on grounds that it would preserve the cash for potential capacity expansion as well as MA in
areas including smart manufacturing integrated circuits and others This was a negative surprise to
investors given the Companys cash balance and past practices The resulting sell-off erased RMB
to Gree over the sudden change in policy
and is now indicating that an interim payment will be made following interim results
Lack of Clear Growth Direction
equipment and smart factories all as potential uses of cash Most recently we have seen news reports
that Gree plans to invest RMB 4Bn per year in semiconductor design but details remain scarce
Reportedly a portion of Grees air conditioners already use chips based on Grees in-house design and
Gree will continue to expand its design capability long term
No Catalysts for Change
Chairwoman Dong Mingzhu has been serving as Chairwoman of Gree Electric since 2012 As of May 31
2018 her 3rd consecutive term was up for re-election The May 31st deadline passed with no news until
Gree announced on June 6 2018 that Dong Mingzhus re-election would be postponed to the annual
shareholders meeting on June 25 2018 With Dong Mingzhu likely to remain at the helm at Gree it is
probable that erratic strategic moves by the Company will continue to frustrate investors In the past 24
months Gree has
1) Broken its 11 year track record of paying continuous dividends while failing to inform shareholders
where funds will be spent
holding ample cash on the balance sheet The Yinlong acquisition resulted in Grees shares being
suspended for approximately seven months
DEFENSIVE CASH POSITION
One factor which is positive of Gree is its huge cash balance of RMB 105Bn and relative low debt level
of RMB 20Bn at the end of 2018Q1 This implies the Company has net cash of RMB 85Bn which is
equivalent to 32% of its market cap Although most home appliance manufacturers enjoy a strong
financial position Grees cash position is significantly higher than that of its peers We believe this has
sustained Grees recent share price performance by enabling the Company to (i) make acquisitions at
current low valuation to sustain earnings growth (ii) maintain a high dividend payout ratio (iii) purchase
some of the outstanding shares to bolster EPS and share price and (iv) book forex translation gains

dividend is a delayed payment on 2017 earnings Hence we estimate the 2018 interim payout will be
approximately RMB 186 per share or 50% of 2017 earnings and further assume that Gree will
continue to maintain a 50% payout ratio for 2018 and beyond On this basis we anticipate strong
dividends over the next 18 months While this interim dividend is a one-off exception this still
represents a nice 10% payoff to investors

Limited Diversification in Distribution
Relative to Haier and Midea Gree is reliant on traditional distributor channel for sales Gree sells 70%
of its air conditioners and small appliances through 27 Tier 1 distributors which typically divide their
geographic coverage by province These distributors move Grees appliances to a network of city and
county level distributors and ultimately to a network of 30000 Gree branded specialty stores Relative

Tier 1  2 City Exposure
Grees store network is relatively more concentrated in Tier 1  2 cities As such Grees sales are
influenced by fluctuations in these respective property markets Local governments in these cities have
been implementing tightening measures since 2017H2 and sales transactions are expected to cool
throughout 2018
Dilution and Share Suspension
Gree has made attempts in recent years to diversify outside of its core air conditioning business On
March 5 2016 Gree proposed an issuance of 15Bln shares to acquire Yinlong The deal was
ultimately vetoed by shareholders but Grees shares were suspended for a period of 7 months (Feb 22
to September 2 2016) while negotiations dragged on

Dong Mingzhu has served as Chairwoman since May 2012 but her term is currently up for renewal
Gree has postponed the decision twice since May 31 2018 without resolution
copper and steel rise management has traditionally implemented ASP hikes However management
