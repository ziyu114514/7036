Why we believe cash dividend will
continue to disappoint the market
Distributors liquidity likely at critical level cut DPS forecasts to below
dividend payout to gradually distribute the signicant net cash on its book
(RMB135 per share as of 1H18) In this report we argue that such is very unlikely
in the next 3 years in our view due to (1) Grees increased lending to distributors
to maintain their liquidity and (2) Gree may hold signicant interbank assets We
cut our cash DPS (dividend per share) forecasts in 201920 by 21%24% to RMB
1919 (23%29% lower than Bloomberg Finance LP consensus)
Grees surging nancing to distributors hinting deteriorating liquidity in the
channel and poor revenue ahead
In 1H18 Grees financing to distributors reached a new high since
2014 ( pre-inventory crisis) we calculate Grees nancing to distributors
(see the third bullet point for denition) has reached RMB45bn in 1H18 up
45% YoY Based on a study on the 2015 inventory cycle a sharp increase
in nancing to distributors tends to mean worsened distributor liquidity
As a result distributor orders (sales) in the subsequent year tend to be
poor (Figure 1 and 2)
Outlook we forecast Gree to increase its financing to distributors
further and such may lead to accelerated cash out ow while curbing
managements incentive to increase cash dividend payout
Financing to distributors an indicator designed for AC (air conditioner)
serves as the main funding source to distributors However the case of
cash from distributors before shipping products thus holding a liability
(advance from customers) instead of assets (accounts receivable) (2)
Gree and Midea have accelerated their lending to distributors To
to distributors (accounts receivable plus loan to distributors minus
advance from customers)
Close to 40% of Grees cash on book is actually interbank
increasing in 1H18 37% of Grees cash on book is interbank asset while
4% being deposit at PBOC We expect interbank asset as a percentage

of total cash to further increase (Figure 5) We do not expect Gree to
distribute its interbank to investors as Gree may need the interest
revenue to propel earnings growth Historically Gree has a tendency to
increase interbank asset as market liquidity is tight (to enjoy the interest
revenue) (Figure 3  4)
Grees interest yield on interbank asset has been much higher than
the big banks interestingly Gree generated a 42% annualized rate
on its interbank asset during 1H18 much higher than Chinas biggest
interbank has been consistently higher than the big banks by a signicant
spread of 100bps (2014 to 1H18 average)
How does Gree generate such a high yield on interbank asset we
estimate that in addition to participate in the ordinary interbank market
that can channel the fund to specic third parties including Grees
distributors
Figure 1 Gree revenue declined sharply in 2015 after
nancing to distributors surged in 2014 In 1H18
nancing to distributors crept up again
Figure 2 Midea very similar trend
Figure 3 Gree tends to hold more interbank asset when
market liquidity is tight This is often the time that Gree
needs to increase its nancing to distributors
Figure 4 Midea same as Gree

Revisions valuation and risks
We take this opportunity to update 2Q18 nancials (which was in-line with DBe)
and increase Grees interest revenue signicantly to model accelerating nancing
to distributors Based on the above analysis we cut our forecasted 201920 DPS
Despite of increased earnings forecasts DBe remains signicantly lower than
consensus
Figure 9 Earnings revision
Figure 11 DBe vs Bloomberg Finance LP consensus
We maintain our target price as increased earnings oset by deteriorated working
capital conditions Our primary valuation methodology is DCF As most of Grees
Banks economics team We use a beta of 1 and a long-term growth rate of 1%
in line with our 1-2% sector assumption for other consumer stocks that we cover
Downside risks include heavier than expected distributor channel inventory more
severe pressure on distributor margins and weaker execution on investments
Upside risks include special cash dividend easing distributor pressure thanks to
better liquidity andor lower channel inventory higher than expected sell-through
thanks to stronger consumer andor weather and accelerating margin expansion

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
