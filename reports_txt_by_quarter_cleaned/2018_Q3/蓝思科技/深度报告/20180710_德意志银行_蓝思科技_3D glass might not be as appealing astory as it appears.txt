The 3D glass upgrade should increase Lenss product ASP but not necessarily
boost its gross margin given higher costs and lower production yield Also we
think the captive account (Apple) will likely stick with 25D glass in 20182019
Lastly for the long term we see a potential over-supply risk and rising threats
from alternative materials (ceramic sapphire etc) The arrival of foldable
display (likely 2020 or 2021) might be negative for the glass maker too as it
requires a cover lens made from film instead of glass maintain Hold
Glass back-cover and 3D glass are clear trends for nearmid-term
Major Chinese OEMs have by now launched their 2018 flagship devices As
the market anticipated most of them (Huawei P20 Vivo X21 Vivo NEX Oppo
R15 Xiaomi M8 etc) have adopted the 3D glass back-cover design We think
the 3D glass trend will stay with high-end phones in 2019 as well In general
ASPs of 3D glass could be 100% higher than that of 25D glass But on the flip
side its gross margin could be noticeably lower due to longer cycle time
in the heating bending chemical strengthening and decorationcoating
processes)
For the past decade the smartphone glass market has been a duopolistic one
dominated by Lens Tech and Biel Crystal However the fast adoption of glass
back-cover and 3D glasses has drawn aggressive investments and capacity
Prevision etc Due to high entry barriers they might not cause a dent in the
by 2019 or 2020 given their solid relationship with tier-one OEMs and good
track records in business expansion Also 3D glass might not be the only
solution for high-end devices Some might switch to ceramic sapphire or
metallic plastic for back-cover materials The potential longterm upgrade will
be the foldable display which requires the cover lens (ie the front cover) to be
made from film rather than glass
We cut 201819 EPS forecasts by 43%40% respectively to reflect potential
GPM decline lack of upgrade in iPhone cover glass and a 50% stock dividend
(the stock dividend alone will reduce EPS by 33%) We hence lower our TP
from CNY294 to CNY14 Our new TP is still based on 08x PEG or 20x PER
08x PEG is in line with regional peers Upsidedownside risks include
strongweak iPhone demand ASP hikedecline and market share gainloss
