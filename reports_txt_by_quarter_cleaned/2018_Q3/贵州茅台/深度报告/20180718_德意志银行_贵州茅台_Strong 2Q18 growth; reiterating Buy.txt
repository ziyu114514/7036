Strong 2Q18 growth reiterating Buy
Sales and prot before tax up 43% and 41% respectively in 2Q18
Moutai reported preliminary results with growth of 43% for sales and 41% for
PBT in 2Q18 (vs 32% for sales and 39% for earnings in 1Q18) The 43% sales
growth was supported by
18% ASP increase on the back of the Dec 2017 price hike from Rmb819
to Rmb969 (high end Moutai)
12% volume growth of high end Moutai We estimate Feitian Moutai sales
volume was around 6500-7000 tons (vs 7600 in 1Q18)
8% from mid-low end Moutai We estimate mid-low end Moutai grew
60% yoy in 1H18 to Rmb4bn accounting for 12% of total sales
PBT growth was lower than sales growth in 2Q18 even though gross margin
rose for high end Moutai after ex-factory price hike mainly due to a higher sales
contribution from mid-low end sales
Near-term outlook Moutai group to achieve over Rmb90bn in 2018
According to the Moutai Group (the controlling shareholder of Kweichow Moutai)
it is highly likely that group sales will achieve Rmb90bn in 2018 implying 18%
yoy growth The group will not set any upside limits for sales growth The group
the groups high condence in Moutais 2H18 growth
Revising up TP to Rmb820 and reiterating Buy
Moutais PBT growth at 40% yoy in 1H18 was higher than consensusDBs
34%27% earnings growth for 2018 We expect sales growth to remain strong in
3Q and expand further thanks to higher demand for Feitian Moutai during peak
season We are revising up our earnings forecasts by 6-8% in 2018-20 to factor
in better than expected volume growth We revise up our target price to Rmb820
based on DCF model (factoring in 95% WACC and 20% terminal growth rate)
We reiterate Buy Downside risk earlier-than-expected channel de-stocking
