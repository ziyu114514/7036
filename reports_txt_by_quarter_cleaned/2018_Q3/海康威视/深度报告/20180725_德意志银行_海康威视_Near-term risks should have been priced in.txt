uncertainties in overseas markets
Hikvision reported in-line 2Q18 results and expected 1-3Q18 profit to grow in
the same range of 15-35% YoY Despite a continued negative impact from the
Chinese governments deleveraging policy and politicaleconomic uncertainties
in overseas markets we believe Hikvisions short-term softness is temporary
and order momentum could pick up again with uncertainties easing over time
and a healthier industry dynamic in the domestic market Maintaining Buy
In-line 2Q18 results
Hikvision reported 2Q18 EPS and operating profit of CNY025 (28% QoQ
29% YoY) and CNY20bn (-3% QoQ 1%YoY) on sales of CNY115bn (23%
QoQ 22% YoY) Salesgross profit were broadly in line with DBconsensus
estimates as the market has already factored in the political impacts
However expenses rose in 2Q18 due to 1) rising recruitment fees for sales
people and RD engineers 2) higher exhibition fees and 3) one-time expense
for the third phase of industrial park opening in Hangzhou With help from a
non-op gain net profit slightly missed DBe by 4%
Slower 1-3Q18 guidance but long-term outlook remains intact
Hikvision expects 1-3Q18 net profit to rise 15%-35% YoY implying 3Q18 net
profit of CNY29bn-42bn or a midpoint of CNY35bn (24% YoY) Although a
solid figure this guidance trails Bloomberg consensus (CNY38bn) by 8% due
to 1) the economicpolitical uncertainties in overseas markets 2) the continual
impact of the Chinese governments deleveraging policy and 3) the small
public security projects being squeezed by the nationwide projects in the short
run Aside from this Hikvision remains positive on its 2018 and long-term
outlook noting 1) the innovation business posted 80% YoY growth in 1H18
and the high growth will continue 2) a rising contribution from the Sky
NetSharp Eyes projects as Hikvision is the key beneficiary of the Chinese
governments efforts to build a nationwide security surveillance system and 3)
its rising AI system integration can drive long-term ASP upside
