ZTE Corporations (ZTE) 1H 2018 results should mark the trough and the Company is on track to
recovery from the impact of the US ban on exports Based on guidance for Q3 2018 ZTEs opera-
tions are likely to return to a more normal level in Q4 2018 We have turned more positive on ZTE as
there should be no major provisions or related write-offs booked going forward We also believe that
ZTE will remain a major beneficiary of 5G investment in China and that the Companys expansion to
non-operator business is a medium-long-term growth driver We believe that ZTEs recovery was
suppliers especially wireless names should benefit after a challenging 1H 2018 However the con-
sumer products segment is expected to lag behind since it is more reliant on overseas markets ZTE
market confidence in ZTE will be restored somewhat after the Q3 and Q4 2018 results In addition to
recovery in operating performance news flow on 5G development in China is a major share price
catalyst for ZTE We maintain our BUY rating with a new target price of HK1867 based on 14x
2019E PER lower than the Companys historical mean of 22x and lower than the industry average of
163x The downward revision is due to lower a PER multiple (cut from 23x to 14x) used The target
price for ZTE-A (000063CH) is RMB2155 based on a 17% premium to ZTE-H (Hang Seng Connect
China AH Premium Index) We have a HOLD rating on ZTE-A
Investment Highlights
1H 2018 Marked the trough ZTEs turnover dropped 270% YoY to RMB394338m in 1H 2018
The Company reported a net loss of RMB78242m in 1H 2018 vs a net profit of RMB19515m in 1H
2017 The results were in line with the mid-point of previous guidance Revenue for the carrier net-
work segment and consumer business reported a YoY decline  of 27% and 36% respectively in 1H
2018 Revenue from government and corporate business grew 18% YoY in 1H 2018 The Companys
blended gross profit margin improved 26% YoY in 1H 2018 due to a higher contribution from the
carrier network segment which has a higher gross profit margin The net loss in 1H 2018 was due
mainly to business suspension and a penalty payment as a result of the US denial order The penalty
booked in 1H 2018 was RMB64bn and there was an RMB25bn YoY increase in provisions and
write-offs in 1H 2018 ZTE issued a profit alert for Jan-Sep 2018 which guided a net loss of
RMB68bn-78bn Based on announcement ZTE is likely to report a net profit in Q3 2018 which
indicates the Company is on the track to recovery
Local market potential to drive recovery We share the view that the market might have con-
cerns about the growth outlook for ZTE given the potential market share loss in overseas markets in
both the equipment and consumer products segments We believe that the consumer product seg-
ment will lag behind but that the equipment and non-operator business especially that related to 5G
development in China should drive recovery in Q4 2018 and 2019 We maintain the view that since
5G is an area supported by the Chinese government it will generate growth potential for equipment
makers such as ZTE In addition to wireless equipment ZTE has invested in new technologies that
allow Company to benefit from adoption of new technologies like NB-IoT
Outperformance to continue ZTE outperformed recently and we believe that the market is
treating it as a proxy for 5G investment in China We expect more news flow on 5G to emerge later
this year and drive up shares of ZTE ZTEs outperformance is expected to continue as concerns
gradually fade
