was slightly up to 126% (vs 120%  100% in 1Q18  2Q17)
 We attribute the slow 2Q to soft panel price and expect a stronger 2H driven
by better seasonality and stabilizing LCD panel price

started construction in April 2018 and targets to start mass production in 2020
with planned monthly capacity at 120K mother glass for 6575 TVs
 Flexible OLED engine 2 in 2019E We are positive on BOEs flexible OLED
business given the largest capacity (three fabs with planned monthly capacity
at 48K mother glass each) and the fastest roll-out (the Chengdu fab started
mass production in October 2017) supporting BOE to gain market share in its
home market China We expect rich China smartphone clients to accelerate
the learning curve We see flexible OLED as engine 2 in 2019E with better
