JV set-up with BMW conrmed
A 5050 JV to develop and manufacture both new energy and traditional
On 10 July Great Wall Motor entered into a JV contract with BMW Group
(BMWGDE EUR8021 Buy) regarding the establishment of Spotlight Automotive
and sell both new energy vehicles (NEV) and traditional vehicles including
export Total investment is estimated to be RMB51bn with registered capital of
RMB17bn to be equally contributed by Great Wall and BMW (ie the remaining
RMB34bn funding will be raised by the JV via other means) Planned initial annual
capacity is 160k units The initial concession period is 15 years with the option
to extend upon mutual consent of the two parties
Great Wall Motor believes the JV will greatly improve the technology level and
and overseas
Deutsche Bank view - a positive for Great Wall but dont get overexcited
Where the JV contract diers from the letter of intent dated February is that 1)
the traditional vehicle business is formally included in the contract 2) the vehicle
export possibility is formally included and 3) Great Wall will not have majority
Wall besides acquiring advanced NEV technologies (and NEV credits) we still
have doubts about the extent of the positive impact in the foreseeable future To
begin with considering the time to set up the JV and get ready for production we
do not expect to see meaningful sales until 2020 Furthermore MINIs global sales
were 372k units in 2017 with 35k units of sales in China Even if we optimistically
assume that the JV will be responsible for producing 100k vehicles at an average
ASP of RMB200k a 10% net prot margin and 50% earnings share would imply
incremental prot of RMB1bn or 11% of our FY20 earnings forecast While this
is denitely a positive to Great Wall Motor it cannot mask the concerns we have

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
