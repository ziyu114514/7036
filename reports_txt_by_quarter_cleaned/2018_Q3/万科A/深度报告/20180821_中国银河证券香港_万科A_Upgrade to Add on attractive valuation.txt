China Vanke-A
Upgrade to Add on attractive valuation
 Vankes 1H18 core net profit rose 44% yoy to Rmb104bn 15% above our estimate
on the back of higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin
 We expect gross margin (post land appreciation tax LAT) to stay at a high level of 25-
27% over FY18-20F
 We believe the major overhang on its share price has been removed as Baoneng has
in the past few months already disposed of an 8% stake in it (vs target of 10%)
 Vanke has a sizeable Rmb520bn of sold but unrecognised sales We estimate it has
already locked in over 95%65% of FY18FFY19F earnings
 Upgrade to Add in view of its attractive valuation Our TP of Rmb350 is unchanged
1H18s core earnings beat our estimate by 15%
Vanke announced a stronger-than-expected set of results with core net profit rising 44%
yoy to Rmb104bn 15% ahead our estimate on the back of higher-than-expected volume
and gross margin No interim dividend was declared as usual Net gearing increased
from 9% at end-2017 to 33% at end-Jun primarily due to one-off expenses to take Global
Logistic Properties private
Contracted sales could see 31% yoy growth in FY18F
In 7M18 Vanke grew its contracted sales by 12% yoy to Rmb350bn Given that it will
have more sellable resources in 2H18F we estimate that Vanke should be able to
achieve total contracted sales of Rmb695bn in FY18F representing 31% yoy growth
Gross margin to stay at 25-27% over FY18-20F
Its gross margin (post land appreciation tax LAT) for 1H18 came in at 274% up 21%
pts yoy and 19% pts above our estimate driven by bookings of relatively high profit
margin projects in 1H18 and recovery of the overall property market since 2016 We
expect its gross margin to be maintained at 25-27% over FY18-20F supported by rapid
price hikes for its property projects
Overhang on Vanke removed
In Apr 2018 it was reported that Baoneng Group plans to dispose of a 10% stake in
Vanke-A In the subsequent months Baoneng reduced its stake in Vanke-A by about 8%
according to the latters stock exchanges announcements (refer to Figure 2 for more
months (total consideration of cRmb5bn at current share price) As such we believe the
major overhang on its share price has been removed
Huge unbooked sales secure earnings for FY18F and FY19F
As at Jun Vanke has a sizeable Rmb520bn of sold but unrecognised sales we expect
most of these to be recognised in 2H18F and FY19F As such we assess that Vanke has
already locked in over 95% of FY18F earnings and 65% of FY19F earnings
Upgrade to Add on attractive valuations
schedule Our target price of Rmb350 is based on par to NAV We upgrade to Add on
attractive valuations Vanke-A is currently trading at 33% discount to NAV 6x FY19F PE
and 5% dividend yield which looks appealing in our view Potential re-rating catalysts
include stronger-than-expected contracted sales Key downside risks are a slowdown in
Chinas economy and further tightening policies imposed by the government
