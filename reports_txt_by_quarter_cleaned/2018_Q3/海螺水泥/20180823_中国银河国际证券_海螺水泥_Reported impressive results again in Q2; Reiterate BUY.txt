Conch Cement reported a recurring net profit of RMB82bn in Q2 2018 up 123% YoY
and near the high end of the guidance provided in the positive profit alert Blended ASP
(cement and clinker) rose from RMB297tonne in Q1 2018 to RMB316tonne in Q2
2018 1H18 net profit is equivalent to 54% of the full-year consensus forecast This sug-
gests the Street is likely to raise the full-year forecast based on the historical seasonali-
ty pattern We also raise our 2018E2019E EPS by 256%29% as the price correction
during the summer season in east China and south China is much smaller than we ex-
pected We reiterate our BUY rating and raise our H-share target price from HK5950
(25x 2018E PBR) to HK65 (27x 2018E PBR) (A-share target price RMB5310 6%
discount to our H-share target price based on the average discount in the past few
Investment Highlights
Q2 recurring net profit surged 123% YoY Excluding some one-off gains recorded in
Q2 2017 recurring net profit in Q2 2018 jumped 123% YoY to RMB82bn Revenue
grew 47% YoY to RMB273bn driven by (i) volume growth of 127% to 838m tonnes
and (ii) a blended ASP price rise from RMB236tonne in Q2 2017 to RMB316tonne in
Q2 2018 Gross profit per tonne increased from RMB81 in Q2 2017 to RMB146 in Q2
Impressive operating cost control Operating costs were RMB18bn in Q2 2018 up
21% YoY much slower than revenue growth of 47% The Companys balance sheet
continued to get stronger with the net cash position expanding from RMB105bn at end
-2017 to RMB142bn at end-June 2018
Strong revenue growth in overseas business but the scale remained small The
Companys overseas revenue jumped 4496% YoY to RMB482m in 1H18 However
the scale was still limited as overseas revenue accounted for only 1% of total revenue
Only a moderate price correction during the low season Usually the summer sea-
son is considered to be the low season due to unfavourable weather conditions such
as typhoons and extremely hot weather However as Figure 2 and 3 show the correc-
tion in cement prices in east China and south China was very moderate in Q2 This
paves the way for price hikes in late Q3 and Q4 during the peak season for construction
activity Therefore we raise our 2018E2019E EPS by 256%29% as the price correc-
tion during the summer season was much smaller than we expected
tion activity to be a key catalyst to drive the share price higher
Reported impressive results again in Q2 Reiterate BUY
