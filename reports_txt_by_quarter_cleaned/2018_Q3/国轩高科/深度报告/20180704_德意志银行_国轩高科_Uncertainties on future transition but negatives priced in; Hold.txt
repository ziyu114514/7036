Uncertainties on future transition but
negatives priced in Hold
Aggressive expansion target but uncertainty looms over NCM maintaining Hold
As the third-largest Chinese battery player Guoxuan positions itself to more than
double its capacity from 75GWh in 2017 to c18GWh by end-2020 and targets
to triple its market share to c18% in three years However we believe there is
still uncertainty regarding Guoxuans endeavors in NCM (lithium nickel cobalt
manganese oxide) batteries (c22% of 2017 shipment) after the disappointments
in the past 12 months We set our target multiple at 154x 2019E PE in line with
the industry average and revise our target price to RMB156 while maintaining
Targets to triple its Chinese battery market share to 18% in 2020
On top of the existing 75GWh capacity in 2017 (including 55GWh for LFP (lithium
iron phosphate) and 20GWh for NCM) Guoxuan is adding 2GWh LFP capacity
and c4GWh NCM capacity in 2018 Total capacity is expected to reach c18GWh
by end-2020 at a 3-year CAGR of 33% but revised down from 20-25GWh
current industry leader CATL
Meaningful progress on NCM batteries in 2H18 remains to be seen
production starting in 2H18 and expects its NCM battery shipment to reach
13GWh in 2018 or 92% YoY Guoxuan supplied it batteries to 45k units of NEV
in 2017 and aims to reach 100k units in 2018 with orders by domestic brands
including BAIC Geely Zotye Chery SAIC and JAC However it remains to be
seen whether Guoxuan a previously LFP-focused battery manufacturer (c78% of
2017 shipment) can have a meaningful presence in NCM batteries
Cutting target price to RMB156 concerns factored in risks
We believe the c40% share price decline in the past three months has reected
investors concerns such as a) ASPmargin pressure in the medium term and b)
the uncertainty regarding its transition to NCM batteries Factoring the 19% YoY
ASP decline and shipment disappointment in 2017 we cut our 20182019 NPAT
forecasts by -27%-50% We set the target multiple at 154x 2019E PE in line
with the industry average and revise our TP accordingly Risks quickerslower-

Adding 6GWh battery capacity to reach 135GWh in 2018
Guoxuan had 75GWh battery capacity at the end of 2017 of which 55GWh was
for LFP batteries and 20GWh for NCM batteries On top of the existing capacity
and c4GWh NCM capacity this year in Hefei and Qingdao reaching c135GWh
at the end of 2018
Expects to see NCM battery demand picking up
While Guoxuan is one of the top battery suppliers in LFP batteries (mostly adopted
vehicles pick up where NCM batteries consist of over 80% share Guoxuan
thus gradually shifts its focus to NCM batteries production expanding its NCM
capacity more than ve-fold from 2GWh in 2017 to 104GWh at end-2020
We have outlined Guoxuans capacity breakdown in Figure 1 below where the
additional NCM production lines are mainly planned in Hefeis fourth factory (total
c5GWh) and Qingdao Laixi factory (c4GWh)

Meaningful progress on NCM batteries remains to be seen
production starting in 2H18 (see Figure 1) and expects its NCM battery shipment
to reach 13GWh in 2018 or 92% YoY As NCM batteries are mainly installed
on EV passenger vehicles Guoxuan has supplied 45k units of these in 2017 and
aims to reach 100k units in 2018
domestic brands including BAIC Geely Zotye Chery JAC b) a larger battery pack
per vehicle to meet the longer driving range requirement and c) market share gain
from cylindrical batteries as Guoxuan believes the prismatic packaging format is
more cost eective when the vehicle carries over 30kWh
A mixed picture between LFP and NCM market shares
However we believe it is still too early to tell whether Guoxuan can repeat its
success in LFP batteries in the NCM eld We present the top 10 EV battery
installation analysis in 2017 and 5M18 in Figure 4 and Figure 5 where Guoxuan
YTD has gained market share in LFP batteries (from 100% in 2017 to 146% in
5M18) but barely had NCM batteries installation (from 23% in 2017 to 08% in
5M18) We believe the main reason behind the fall is linked to the dierent timings
of auto OEMs model launch schedules but it requires additional orders from EV
batteries judging from the market share analysis YTD

Earnings and target price
Factoring in 2017 results cutting target price to RMB156
Guoxuans 2017 battery ASP and shipment were below our original expectations
have revised our numbers after factoring the 2017 nancial results battery
volume unit pricing and margin trajectory Since changes in the battery industry
happened faster than our previous expectation we cut our 20182019 net prot
forecast by 27%50%
Please see Figure 6 below for our detailed sales volume and unit margin
please refer to Figure 7 and Figure 8
For our 2018E earnings revision we believe the batterys pricing pressure
(-16% YoY) will be somewhat oset by cost decline (-10% YoY) but the
main factor to have a negative impact on earnings estimate should be
volume assumption (-37% vs previous estimate)
For our 2019E earnings revision we expect the cumulative eect from
pricing pressure (-13% YoY) coupled with volume assumption revision
on our earnings estimate

Concerns largely factored in with c40% correction in 3 months
Guoxuans share price has corrected by c40% in the past three months (Figure
9) which has mainly reected investors concern related to a) ASP and margin
pressure in the medium term and b) the uncertainty regarding the transition
to NCM batteries We believe the entire battery sector has encountered similar
issues except for the market leader CATL and several battery players are also
looking into a transition similar to that of Guoxuan

Guoxuan is the third-largest EV lithium battery player in China with c6%
EV lithium battery market share in terms of installation this year We believe
help it to grow market share and make it one of the beneciaries of the Chinese
governments target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020 However
battery unit pricing decline and EV subsidy policy change may put pressure on
its margin outlook Hold
As Guoxuan has listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO in 2015 we
believe its historical PE band may not reect its future outlook We adopt a 2019E
trajectory and is in line with battery manufacturers average
Key Industry updownside risks 1) Signicant changes in the Chinese
governments EV subsidy policy 2) Weakerstronger-than-expected volume
growth in the next three years 3) Quickerslower-than-expected ASP drop or

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
