Consumers are trading up for better quality liquor and brands especially
during social events such as marriage celebrations and gatherings Meanwhile
due to the expanding poverty-rich gap the trade-up trend is more prevalent in
the premium and super-premium segments than in the low-end segment
Lastly the premium segment has good branding and reasonable prices 
Feitian Moutai is priced at RMB1800 which is still overly expensive even for

Industry consolidation to accelerate
While the super-premium segment is highly concentrated (dominated by
Moutai Wuliangye and Luzhou Laojiao) the premium segment is still highly
fragmented with various local brands in each province Yanghe is the lead
brand but with only a 30% volume share and a 22% value share in the
premium segment The top five brands occupied a value share of only 54% in
2017 (Figure 12)
We forecast consolidation in the premium segment to accelerate in the next
few years First consumers tend to buy better branded products aided by their
increasing brand awareness Second leading brands product availability are
increasing with improved channel penetrations Third leading brands have
better resources in advertisement and promotion with operating leverage We
forecast the market share of the top five brands will increase to 66% in 2020
from 54% in 2017

growth was the fastest among liquor name in 2007-17 (Figure 14) Yanghe
derived more than 50% of sales from the premium segment in 2017 Yanghes
leading position in the premium segment is helped by its strong channels
good branding and diversified products We expect Yanghe to continue to
consolidate the premium segment in the next three years

Channels wide flat and efficient
Different from most of its peers that have a long history Yanghes main brand
Blue Classic which was launched in 2003 is a much younger make For
usually adopted as a more straight forward method to push sales As such
Yanghe has been actively building its channels since the launch of Blue
distributors Yanghes distributing model is more skewed towards that of large
salespersons are closely involved in retail end promotions penetrating and
obtaining orders while distributors are mainly responsible for basic functions

For example Yanghe has more than 350 salespersons in Anhui Prior to 2015
it focused on city-level markets before expanding to county-level areas In
Hefei it covers 70% of liquor specialty stores with more than 30 salespersons
and 40 promoters Meanwhile it classifies retailers into three categories ie
flagship stores key stores and ordinary stores based on location traffic and
demand Salespersons conduct in-store advertisement and promotions of
different magnitudes Through these measures it achieved sales of RMB17bn
in 2017 in Anhui
By the end of 2017 Yanghe had built a nationwide channel with over 5000
salespersons 8000 distributors and 30000 ground promoters This channel
covers 33 provinces and municipalities including 330 cities and 2582
counties nationwide and boasting more than 2m of POS Yanghes
salesperson and distributor numbers are significantly higher than those of
other leading liquor brands (Moutai Wuliangye Laojiao and Fen wine)

Branding well positioned and increasing awareness
Although Yanghes main brand Blue Classic is relatively new -- launched in
branding investment Its key product Blue Classic series has the slogan The
sea is the worlds largest but the sky is deeper than the sea yet mens
sentiment is more profound than the sky (世界上最宽广的是海，比海更高远的是
天空，比天空更博大的是男人的情怀) The slogan reflects Yanghes consumer-
the aspirations of consumers whereas other premium liquor brands focus
more on connecting their brand names with culture patriotism and luxury This
niche positioning differentiates Yanghe from other brands and enhance
consumer awareness in our view

Products less inherited but more innovative
Yanghes products are innovative which fits the changing demand trend of
consumers Moutai and Wuliangyes flagship products Feitian Moutai and
Wuliangye crystal bottle have maintained consistent tastes  almost
unchanged for more than 50 years However Yanghes Blue Classic series is
evolving as it specifically designs its products to meet consumer taste
preferences Yanghe underwent 4325 of consumer tasting tests before it
launched the Blue Classic series in 2003 Based on the tasting results it
positions Blue Classic as a mellow taste beverage with a specifically sweet
mellow soft clear and fragrant taste This differs from traditional liquor that
focuses on aroma
Some investors argue Yanghes innovative beverages do not offer as much
moat as that of traditional brands but we believe this is necessary for long-
term growth (similar for other FMCG products) Consumer tastes evolve over
years For example yellow wine was a mainstream alcoholic drink during the
Qing Dynasty and in the early 20th century This changed to baijiu after 1949
sustainable growth Yanghes culture of innovation should make it more
resilient to changing consumer tastes in the long term
Weifenzi is another example of innovation Low alcohol content baijiu is now
a trend due to consumers growing health consciousness According to the
Guangdong and Jiangsu) prefer low-alcohol baijiu Accordingly Yanghe
launched Weifenzi baijiu to meet this trend in 2014 Weifenzi is a low-
alcohol baijiu but tastes the same as a high-alcohol baijiu The low-alcohol
baijiu contains nucleotides analogues which protects the liver Although
Weifenzi has not contributed meaningful sales it is a good trial and reflects
Yanghes innovation culture

Resilient growth with high
Summary new regions product mix upgrades and new
category to drive growth
major sales is still derived from Jiangsu It also derives around 50% of sales
from mid-range products We see a great potential for Yanghe to achieve sales
growth through geography expansion and product mix upgrades More
importantly it has high growth visibility as we believe Yanghe can easily
replicate the successful experience in Jiangsu in other regions We forecast a
22% sales CAGR in 2018-20E
Geography penetrating from Jiangsu to new Jiangsu
Yanghe is headquartered in Suqian a city in Jiangsu It derived 53% of sales
from Jiangsu in 2017 Following its success in increasing penetration in
Jiangsu management is now allocating more resources to other provinces It
targets to increase the sales portion from non-Jiangsu markets to 70% in 2020
implying the non-Jiangsu segment could grow at least 30% faster than the
Jiangsu region
Yanghes focused markets are mainly in regions closed to Jiangsu including
Shandong Henan Anhui Zhejiang and Hubei These regions have sizable
liquor regions such as Sichuan and Guizhou Except in Anhui and Zhejiang
there are no listed liquor brands in these regions and local liquor names mostly
focus on the mid- to low-end categories These regions have a total population
similar to Jiangsus (Figure 25)
Yanghe launched a new Jiangsu market strategy to expand its new market
in 2014 The strategy refers to potential markets in county and city levels that
could contribute meaningful revenue (annual sales should be over RMB8m for
county-level markets and over RMB15m for city-level markets) Until 1Q18
there were 495 new Jiangsu markets which contributed 70% of Jiangsu
revenue According to management it will replicate its successful model in
Jiangsu in the new Jiangsu markets

Considering Yanghes strong branding channel operation and diversified
products we believe the strategy will be successful On branding Yanghes
Blue classic has better brand awareness than most local brands in the
premium segment and it is able to spend higher advertisement dollars in
future helped by its large scale On channel Yanghes successful experience in
in-depth model channel profit allocation and execution could be replicated in
new regions On product given its key products are from the mid-range to
premium segments we believe Yanghe has flexibility to penetrate into new
markets based on local consumption
We forecast Yanghes sales from non-Jiangsu markets will record a 36% CAGR
from RMB93bn in 2017 to RMB233bn in 2020 and expect this to contribute
65% of its total sales in 2020

For the next three year we expect the premium segment to be the fastest
growing category for Yanghe
demand Our channel checks indicate that the mainstream price range
for social dining in south Jiangsu has moved up to over RMB300-500
from RMB100-300 before 2016
Yanghe is pushing premium products through allocating more AP
expense and providing more channel incentives Meanwhile as
Yanghes SeaSkyDream series are sub brands of Blue classic
consumers could easily move from Sea to Sky and from Sky to
Dream when they have a higher budget
The retail price hikes of super-premium brands Moutai Wuliangye and
premium products
We forecast Yanghes sales proportion from Dream Blue to increase from
20% in 2017 to 35% in 2020 This will contribute RMB8bn incremental sales
from 2017 and lead to a 2ppt gross margin expansion in 2017-20E

2018E 25% sales growth and 28% earnings growth
We forecast Yanghe to report 25% sales growth in 2018 driven by 1) 10%
volume growth mainly contributed by its non-Jiangsu market expansion and
stable volume in Jiangsu and 2) an estimated 13% ASP increase due to
product mix upgrades and price hikes in 1Q and 3Q Management has guided
for 20% sales growth in 2018 (its historically growth has outperformed its
guidance in the past except in 2013-14) (Figure 33)
We forecast Yanghe to report 28% earnings growth in 2018 with 70bps yoy
net margin improvement This is driven by an estimated 30bps gross margin
expansion helped by ex-factory price hikes and product mix change and an
estimated 140bps decline in SGAsales benefited from operation leverage
Our 2018 forecast implies 24% sales growth and 277% earnings growth in
2019-20E 20% sales CAGR and 22% earnings CAGR
We forecast a 20% sales CAGR for Yanghe from RMB249bn in 2018 to
RMB358bn in 2020 mainly driven by
105% volume CAGR over the same period helped by a CAGR of over 30%
in non-Jiangsu markets and likely flat growth in the Jiangsu province
9% ASP CAGR over the same period a result of continued product mix
upgrades and higher sales proportion from non-Jiangsu markets where
the ASP is usually higher than that in Jiangsu due to different product mix
We expect Yanghes net margin to expand from 34% in 2018 to 354% in
2020 driving net profit to register a 223% CAGR from RMB85bn in 2018 to
RMB127bn in 2020E The margin expansion is attributable to a likely 150bps
improvement in gross margin and a 50bps saving in SGA
For cash conversion cycle we estimate its inventory turnover days will
continue to decline from 584 days in 2017 to 520 days in 2020 helped by
improved inventory management We expect the number of AR turnover days
to maintain stable at 3 while AP days to return to its long-term average of
more than 100

Initiating with Buy TP at RMB150
We use a DCF methodology to derive our 1-year target price of RMB150
factoring in 95% WACC (39% risk free rate 56% equity risk premium 10x
beta debt free structure) and 2% terminal growth which is in line with other
flow has enough visibility We initiate with Buy
Our 1-year target price implies an 18x 2020E PE or a 065x PEG based on its
net profit CAGR at 24% in 2018-20E This is in line with other listed baijiu peers
at PEG of 064 The target PE is also in line with Yanghes average of 17x
forward PE in the past nine years Meanwhile given Yanghe has better
well-established branding we think it is fair to trade at higher valuations

cause a collapse in stock prices In November 2012 Jiu Gui Liquor reportedly
had plasticizer contained in its products which was 26x higher than standards
based on the test results of Shanghai Intertek The incident caused the entire
baijiu segment to witness a stock price collapse the next day Although no
would be adverse impacts on stock prices
Government policy change
Since the central government put forward an eight-point rule in 2012 local
governments have implemented strict control on entertainment consumption
of liquor In 2017 several local governments tightened the regulation with
some banning liquor consumption Although we have seen baijiu consumption
moved from government to business entities the government may still
implement more adverse policies on baijiu consumption which could lead to
another de-stocking cycle
Consumer preference shift
Yanghes major business is producing and selling baijiu Due to consumers
increasing health consciousness and changing preferences consumers may
choose other beverages to replace baijiu which could lead to an overall
decline in the whole industry
Macro fixed asset investment growth is correlated with FMCG consumption A
growth slowdown could dampen consumer confidence and consumption
capability leading to lower demand
