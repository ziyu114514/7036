Luoyang HQ visit rearms earnings
uptrend raising target price
Order momentum picking up Buy on multi-year earnings upcycle ahead
We visited Jonhon Optronics Luoyang headquarters last week and came back
with positive takeaways Despite lagging revenue conversion in 3Q the strong
pick-up in new orders along with new capacity expansion should accelerate
earnings growth to 26% yoy in 2H17 (vs 11% in 1H17) and 30% starting
2018 With similar drivers ahead the 2013-15 earnings upcycle - when the stock
outperformed its benchmark (SZCOMP) by 100% on strong earnings growth -
looks likely to be repeated We raise our target price by 23% to Rmb43 and
maintain Buy
Strong new order pipeline
Management guided for a back-end loaded 2017 at the beginning of this year and
expects growth for defence and NEV to speed up in 2H Since the beginning of
bit later than expected due to military reform (hence organizational reshue) and
stricter subsidy scheme (hence reevaluation of subsidy eligibility required) Given
capacity constraints (for NEV) and defense customers delivery schedules we
believe deliveries could be very skewed towards 4Q17 with revenue conversion
of some orders potentially delayed to 1H18
Multi-year earnings upcycle in sight with upside potential
During a 5-year plan (FYP) period Jonhons earnings growth tends to pick up from
the third year and accelerate sharply into the nal two years With accelerating
weapon modernization next-generation mobile network (5G in this FYP period)
vehicle electrication and new capacity expansion we project a 33% earnings
CAGR over 2017-19 (vs a 29% CAGR over 2012-14) Taking into account the
high base our current projection assumes constant growth acceleration (30%
) towards 2020 but we see upside potential from 1) successful development
of integrated systems for defense applications (high value and high margin)
2) overseas expansion 3) new products (eg high-speed backplane connector
liquid cooling system etc) 4) further penetration into Teslas supply chain These
additional growth drivers if they materialize could potentially push 2019-20
Lowering earnings but lifting target price by 23% risks
Our earnings estimate cuts of 4-6% for 2017-19 reect 1) delayed revenue
driven by slower-than-expected Huawei business and 3) better-than-expected

1H NP achieved 48% of our previous full-year estimate largely in line with the

rush military orders placed towards end-2015 were delivered in 1H16 (when sales
rose 36% yoy) and 2) strong NEV momentum was sustained into 1H16 before
cooling down in 2H16 on subsidy uncertainties
GP margin expansion of c3ppt yoy to 368% (vs 2017DBe 338%) is better
than expected driven by stringent cost control and favorable product mix (higher

For 2Q alone sales reverted to positive growth (5% yoy) from a 3% drop in 1Q
with margin further expanded to 382% vs 352% in 1Q NP growth accelerated
slightly to 12% as strong margin expansion was partly oset by higher opex

While no detailed breakdown by end-market was disclosed at the investor
meeting management mentioned that the defense segment still managed to
grow albeit at a slower pace due to the high base By end-market aviation
shipbuilding and weaponry still saw double-digit growth while electronics and
nuclear recorded negative growth
Sales of NEV segment were down c50% yoy in 1H largely in line with the
growth with strong export growth (40% yoy) largely oset by slow domestic

order pipeline from its customers for both defense and NEV segments While the
trend has been well anticipated the timing of orders was actually a bit later than
Military reform and stricter NEV subsidy
scheme are the two causes for the delay in
contract signing
For defense the delay was mainly due to military reform which has
resulted in an organizational reshue within the weapon procurement
department
For NEV the delay was mainly because of the additional time it takes for
customers to go through the re-evaluation process in order to be eligible
for incentives as a stricter subsidy scheme is imposed
Given capacity constraints and defense
customers delivery schedules we believe
deliveries could be very skewed towards
4Q17 with revenue conversion of some
orders potentially delayed to 1H18
early-3Q normally in the past) For NEV its NEV production line is already
operating at full utilization now which means capacity constraints could impact
revenue conversion heading into 4Q with deliveries of some orders potentially
delayed to 1H18 Similarly for defense due to customers strict delivery
schedules we believe a risk of delayed revenue conversion (into 1H18) also exists
Taking into account the risks above we are now expecting 26% earnings growth
in 2H17 lowered from our previous forecast of 43% growth In particular we
expect growth to signicantly accelerate starting 4Q with strong momentum likely
persisting into 2018

Growth of defense segment is typically back-
end loaded within a ve-year-plan period
The defense sector is largely policy driven and heavily planned by the government
As a result Jonhons defense business has showed a clear pattern within a ve-
year-plan period The rst two years are typically slow in terms of growth as new
equipment models are mostly at the RD stage Growth normally speeds up from
the third year towards the nal two years (ie the fourth and the fth year) on

by the 5G network build-out
We see very similar growth drivers in
upcycle in the previous FYP period
In short we believe similar growth drivers could continue to play out in the nal
three years of this FYP period including 1) accelerating weapon modernization 2)
next-generation mobile network build-out and 3) strong NEV sales These positive
drivers along with a similar capacity expansion pace (Luoyang Phase II in 2014

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
