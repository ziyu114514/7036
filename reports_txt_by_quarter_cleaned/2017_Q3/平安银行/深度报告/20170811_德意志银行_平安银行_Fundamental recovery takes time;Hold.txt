PAB reported 2Q17 net profit of Rmb63bn up 2% yoy 1H17 earnings were up
2% yoy accounting for 51% of our 2017 forecast The uninspiring 2Q17 results
were mainly characterized by higher funding cost which we believe represents
a read-across to other wholesale-funded joint-stock banks (JSBs) NIM fell
another 15bps qoq Asset quality has yet to see major improvement while
capital remains a concern that is not solved by convertible bond issuance The
only sweet spot is the retail strategy which started to bear fruit in 1H17 with a
40%64% contribution to revenue profit (vs 29% in 1H16) Net net we believe
it will take more time before we see a fundamental recovery Hold
Key trends of 2Q17 results
NIM in 2Q17 was 238% down 15bps qoq or 33bps yoy we believe it was
impacted by a market rate hike and financial deleveraging Deposit cost
was up 11bps qoq to 192% and interbank borrowing cost up 28bps qoq to
34% Meanwhile loan yield continued to decline (594% vs 606% in
1Q17) In addition PAB saw difficulties in growing deposits (up 07% yoy)
Asset quality continued to deteriorate the NPL ratio nudged up 2bps qoq
to 176% with the coverage ratio at 161% (163% in 1Q17) The SML ratio
stood at 414% up 3bps hoh meanwhile 90-day overdue loanNPL
balance remained high at 154% (vs 158% in 2016) We estimate 2Q17
NPL formation was 284bps higher than 254bps in 1Q17 but lower than
326bps on average in 2016
Weak capital ratio The CET1 ratio stood at only 813% in 2Q17 down
15bps qoq with RWA density up 35bps qoq to 703% PAB recently
announced a Rmb26bn A-share convertible bond plan but we dont think
this can solve the capital issue in the short term In our view it may need
to further raise capital through a placement and reduce its payout ratio
(2016 12% vs big 4 banks c30%)
CIR fell 58ppt yoy to 259% driven by a 21% drop in operating expenses
It is worth highlighting that its total employees fell 14% YTD leading to a
23% yoy decline in labor cost
Retail contributed 40% of group revenue and 64% of group profit in 1H17
(29% and 29% in 1H16) which was a positive development in our view
We think this was a result of its strategic focus on retail banking and
cross-selling from Ping An Group We will seek more details during the
post-results conference call to be held on 11 August

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
