Wanhua Chemical (WHC) is the biggest global methylene diphenyl
diisocyanate (MDI) producer with a 24% market share Its share price has a
72% correlation with MDI spreads and as  spreads have risen 165% in the last
12 months the share price has risen 75% However we see more potential
share price upside as we believe the MDI upcycle will continue until 2020 on
slowing new capacity additions globally We also see new product ramp-up
and potential asset injection as key earnings drivers We expect WHCs EPS to
achieve a 37% CAGR in 2016-19E with ROIC improving to 23% in 2017-19E
Strong supply-demand supports MDI upcycle
In 2016-20E we expect a 35% supply CAGR below the 48% CAGR in 2010-
16 when there was a big capacity increase On the other hand we expect
demand to record a healthy 56% CAGR during the same period driven by
materials
Consequently we expect the MDI operating rate to increase from 87% in 2016
to 94% by 2020 This should expand the MDI spread from RMB9500tonne in
2016 to RMB15928tonne in 2019E a 19% CAGR Other PU such as TDI also
will likely enter an upcycle post 2018E we see the TDI operating rate reaching
89% by 2020 Conversely with the new 300ktpa TDI line expected in 2018 we
project WHCs PU volume should increase a 7% CAGR over 2016-19E
Entering high-end chemicals market
Currently polyurethane (PU) accounts for 55% of WHCs revenue (71% of GP)
WHC has branched out to six new business units since 2015 of which TPU
PC and water-based paint are promising products as China is still a net
importer of high-end TPU and PC products and we believe water-based paint
will be a key beneficiary of the stricter environmental regulation We expect
the revenue of the functional material and specialty chemicals segments to
Asset injection  new business ahead with flexible balance sheet
As stated by WHC it is likely to acquire BorsodChem (BC) by Sep-2018 from
capacity of 240k250k400ktpa in Hungary We believe this asset injection
feasibility studies for the construction of a 1mntpa ethylene capacity and to
utilise its strong balance sheet (net gearing of 22%2% in 2018E19E) We have
not factored either of these events into our model currently
Valuation and risks target price RMB420
Our target price of RMB420 is based on 80x EVEBITDA at an 18% discount
to its historical average of 97x We use a Gordon Growth Model applying
average 2017-18E FCF growth to its EBITDA The shares trade at 62x 12-
month forward EVEVITDA at a 12% discount to global MDI peers and a 36%
discount to their historical mean Our target price implies 47x 2017-18E PB
we believe the premium to global peers is justified as its ROE averaged 38% in
2017-18E which is at a 137% premium over MDI peers Key risks fluctuations
in oil and chemical product prices lower-than-expected GDP growth and
unexpected corporate actions with demanding valuation More detail pp 3-4

The MDI industry has very high technical and capital barriers and hence it is a
highly concentrated market In 2016 global MDI capacity amounted to
74mntpa with the top five producers controlling c77% of total capacity
According to IHS WHC ranks No 1 among global MDI producers with a total
capacity of 18mntpa (24% of global market share)
MDI upcycle to continue until 2020E and new capacity in TDI
WHC benefits most from MDI improvement in our view We estimate MDI
demand will outpace capacity growth and the utilisation rate should reach 94%
by 2020E vs 87% in 2016 We expect global MDI demand to record a 56%
CAGR in 2016-2020E outpacing capacity expansion with a CAGR of 35% We
see slowing MDI supply growth due to 1) shutdowns of outdated production
facilities (including Korea Japan Spain etc) and 2) lack of capacity additions
in Asia the only large new capacity would be Sadara Chemical with a 400ktpa
capacity in the Middle East in 2018E We expect WHCs MDI spread to expand
to RMB15928tonne in 2019E a 19% CAGR over 2016-19E
With a more diversified product portfolio going forward we believe this would
material  specialty chemicals revenue to surge a 33% CAGR over 2016-19E
Among the new products thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) polycarbonate
(PC) and water-based paint are the three most promising products
Unlocking value  potential corporate actions
We estimate WHCs net gearing should drop to 49% in 2017E vs the 5-year
net cash (without new investment) by 2019E Also we believe WHCs healthy
balance sheet should enable it to acquire Wanhua Industrial Groups (WIG)
stake in BorsodChem (BC) which has a MDITDIPVC capacity of 240k250k
400k-tpa in Hungary This would strengthen WHCs global presence although
valuation is an uncertainty Besides WHC plans to build a 1mntpa ethylene
cracker capacity in Shandong which will further its vertical integration
We derive WHCs target price of RMB420share by using 80x EVEBITDA
based on the Gordon Growth Model at an 18% discount to its historical
average of 97x Our target price implies 47x 2017-18E PB which is 53%
higher than its 1 SD of historical mean PB
Key risks include 1) slower-than-expected demand growth in the consumer
market which is the main source of downstream demand for MDI TPU and
PC 2) slower-than-expected energy price recovery 3) slower-than-expected
ramp up in TPI capacity and 4) any unexpected corporate actions with
demanding valuation

What next More potential upside yet to price in
WHC share prices have almost doubled in the past 12 months but we see
more upside considering 1) MDI upcycle likely to continue until 2020E 2) new
capacity to start in 2018E and 3) new product ramp-up plus potential asset
injection and new business plan We believe past share price performance has
not fully reflected the strong improvement in free cash flow and return on
assets We expect WHCs EPS to achieve a 37% CAGR in 2016-19E with ROIC
improving to an average of 23% in 2017-19E from 15% in 2016

WHC trades at 103x and 62x average 2017-18E PE and EVEBITDA at a
discount of 19% and 12% respectively to global MDI peers but its 2017-18E
PB of 34x is at an 86% premium over global MDI peers In our view WHC
deserves to trade at a premium to peers given its superior ROE (137% higher
than peers) and strong free cash flow yields
We derive our target price using the Gordon Growth Model Our target price
RMB420share is based on 80x EVEBITDA using 2017-18E FCF to its
EBITDA This implies an 18% discount to its historical average EVEBITDA of
97x while we expect its FCF to improve at a 12% CAGR in 2016-19E much
better than in the previous MDI upcycle when WHCs FCF stream was in a
deficit Our EVEBITDA-based TP is at a 7% discount to the DCF model

In our opinion EVEBITDA is a better methodology than DCF to value WHC
because 1) it addresses free cash flow situation changes as WHCs heavy
investment cycle has already passed 2) it addresses the petrochemical
valuation methodology We cross check our valuation with a DCF below

MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) is an aromatic diisocyanate MDI reacts
with polyols in the manufacturing of polyurethane MDI is categorised as pure
MDI and polymeric MDI
Pure MDI is mainly used to produce the slurry of synthetic leather sole
resin and spandex
Polymeric MDI is used to produce rigid PU foam adhesive and
flexible PU foams
MDI is an aromatic diisocyanate consisted of isocyanate and polyhydric
alcohols MDI is the most important feedstock for the production of
polyurethane (PU) which is the sixth-largest plastic after polyethylene PVC
polypropylene polystyrene and ABS PU possesses not only the elasticity of
rubber but also the strength of plastic with wide applications in economic
activities of multiple industries including chemicals aerospace automobile
medical treatment etc
Highly concentrated market  MDI  TDI
The PU industry has very high technical and capital barriers which lead to a
highly concentrated market In 2016 global MDI capacity amounted to
74mntpa with the top five producers controlling 77% of total capacity WHC
tops the list of global MDI producers with total capacity at 18mntpa followed
by BASF Convestro Huntsman and Dow with a share of 21% 19% 13% 9%
respectively Likewise in the TDI market the top five producers control 77% of
total capacity In China the MDI market is even more concentrated with only
five active producers and WHCs 18mntpa capacity accounts for 62% of total
capacity On TDI the China landscape is changing with WHC entering the TDI
market its new 300ktpa capacity is scheduled to start in 2018 which will
instantly make it a market leader with a 24% share in China

11 August 2017
Deutsche Bank AGHong Kong
PU continues to be key
earnings driver while MDI
The PU segment (MDI  TDI) accounted for 55% of WHCs revenue in
2016 We believe the positive outlook of the MDI industry aligns with
WHCs future performance
With improvements in the global MDI utilisation rate we expect
WHCs MDI margin to expand from RMB9500tonne in 2016 to
RMB159288tonne in 2019E at a 19% CAGR
We expect China MDI demand to register a 73% CAGR over 2016-
2020 a rise of 19mntpa China MDI demand is mainly driven by
refrigerators construction materials and slurry and sole resin which
account for 45% 225% and 18% of total demand respectively
Formula for a bull market steady demand growth 
slowing capacity additions  feedstock cost drop
Global MDI capacity rose at a 48% CAGR between 2010 and 2016 More than
50% of total MDI capacity is located in Asia followed by Europe with c30% of
total capacity However we see global capacity additions slowing down to a
35% CAGR in 2016-20E to reach 82mntpa by the end of 2020E China MDI
capacity expanded rapidly in 2011-16 with a 16% CAGR and reached
c30mntpa in 2016 which exceeded the global capacity CAGR of c5%
2017 and 2020E globally Also Jilin Connell MDI plans to roll out another
800ktpa of new MDI capacity (c10% of global capacity) in 2018 However
considering several environmental issues the new capacity is highly likely to
be deferred Therefore we have not included this in our expected new
capacity We believe rapid MDI capacity additions should slow down starting

Suffering from the rapid capacity growth over the past five years China MDI
facilities utilisation rate dipped to c60% in 2015 and will likely continue to
drop to the low-50% levels due to capacity additions in 2016 Given stable
demand and consumption growth we expect utilisation to gradually recover
from the trough level in 2016 with few new capacity additions

The rapid capacity expansion over the past four years has caused global
utilisation to drop continuously from 87% to 84% in 2015 However as we
expect capacity additions to slow down we estimate utilisation will rebound to
87% in 2017 90% in 2018 90% in 2019 and 91% in 2020 TDI is in a very
similar situation We expect it to witness slowing capacity additions and after
2018 we believe there will be a lack of new supply which should help TDI
utilisation gradually recover to 89% by 2020E from 83% in 2016

Despite the relatively stable downstream demand MDI prices especially in
Asia markets have dropped significantly since the end of 2012 till 1H 2016
which is mainly due to the rapid capacity expansion Over the past five years
and China MDI capacity increased by c400ktonne pa (on average) while
apparent demand increased by only c100ktonne pa The worsened supply-
demand dynamic depressed MDI prices as well as the MDI-benzene spread
Also MDI prices are highly sensitive to crude oil prices as aniline is one of the
main raw materials

Since 2016 China MDI prices have started to recover from the trough driven
by 1) decreased MDI imports from Japan and Korea where MDI production
was unstable or halted and China polymeric MDI imports declined by 15% in
the past trailing 12 months and 2) stabilized crude oil price and chemical
prices In the past four years WHCs share price and MDI are highly correlated

On the other hand WHC share price correlation with petrochemical products is

negative correlation with the prices of benzene  Brent oil which are its key
feedstocks at -029  -038 R-square efficiency respectively

other than cost-push factors because its correlation with benzene and Brent oil
prices is only -018-032 R-square efficiency while it has 086 R-square
efficiency correlation with the MDI price Conversely the MDI price has 046

A more diversified portfolio ahead
With a more diversified product portfolio going forward we believe it should
new business units to further strengthen its downstream products mix Of the
new products produced from these six new business units specialty
polyurethane (ie thermoplastic polyurethane - TPU) polycarbonate (PC) and
water-based paint are the three most promising TPU is facing booming
downstream demand due to intelligent wearable devices PC should alleviate
the pressure of high dependence on imports Water-based paint should benefit
from stricter environment protection laws We expect functional materials and
specialty chemicals revenue to record a 33% CAGR between 2016 and 2019E
TPU expecting ascending downstream demand
TPU is any-of-a-class of polyurethane plastics with many properties including
elasticity transparency and resistance to oil grease and abrasion TPU has
many applications including automotive instrument panels sporting goods
medical devices drive belts and footwear
WHCs performance material business unit is the biggest TPU manufacturer in
APAC with the widest product range Out of the c500kt total capacity of
China WHCs annual TPU production capability is 90ktpa (18%) and offers
high-end TPU in the market
TPU is now a popular material found in outer cases of mobile electronic
wristband for the booming market of intelligent wearable devices which
country since 2013 while the majority of Chinese TPU is low-end product and
fails to meet the increasing high-end TPU demand We observe that Chinese
high-end TPU demand still relies on imports and TPU import prices are far
higher than export prices

Water-based paint the beneficiary of the strictest new environmental
Compared with traditional paint water-based paint is more environmentally
friendly and cost efficient In the global market water-based paint has
surpassed traditional paint it accounted for c44% of the total paint
consumption in 2014 In China the consumption of water-based paint used in
construction materials and automobile paint is growing rapidly accounting
Water-based paint should benefit from stricter environment protection laws
We expect the revenue of main business including MDI and the new chemical
products to see a CAGR of 21% in 2016-19E As MDI only accounts for 417%
products and other core business segments including functional materials and
special chemicals
Since 2015 there has been a paint tax of 4% under the new environment
protection law However paint with Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) of less
than 420gL will be waived from the paint tax The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-
2020) petrochemical and chemicals development guidance also notes that
producers should facilitate the RD and promotion process of environmentally
environmentally friendly paint water-based paint should be one of the main
beneficiaries of the strictest environment protection law as well as the
development guidance
Figure 50 Water-based paint  main advantages
Environmental advantages
environment Long-term exposure to high VOC environment places people at serious risk of cancer By contrast water-
based paints have zero emissions of VOC
Solvent based paints represent 75% of total 15 million tons industrial paints If 50% will be replaced by water-based paints
RMB15bn will be saved
Policy guidance advantages
Since Feb 1st 2015 the government has levied 4% of consumption tax on coatings with the exception of VOC lower than
420gL in the construction process
the dominating part is water

WHC improved its balance sheet via issuance of 158mn new shares to repay
debt and set up new business in 2016 WHCs net gearing should cut to 49%
in 2017E from 118% in 2016 All of WHCs debt is in bank loans after repaying
the corporate bond in 2015 We expect that WHCs net interest expense
should decrease to RMB504mn in 2019E from RMB890mn in 2015
likely to acquire WIGs stake in BC by September 2018 which has a
MDITDIPVC capacity of 240kpta  250ktpa  400ktpa in Hungary Besides the
benefit of having instant capacity expansion we believe the planned asset
injection could strengthen WHCs global presence although valuation is an
uncertainty Nowadays MDI  TDI  PVC constructions usually cost about
RMB19bn  RMB21bn  RMB04bn for a 100ktpa of capacity The overall
replacement cost for such capacity would be near RMB114bn

BCs MDI and TDI capacity is equivalent to 13%  83% of WHC 2018E capacity
Our sensitivity analysis suggests BC has the potential to bring another 17% of
EBIT to WHC assuming BC achieves a 75% utilisation rate with gross margins
of MDI  TDI similar to those of WHC a PVC margin of USD240tonne and its
operating expenses per unit doubles that of WHC We have not factored any
potential acquisition in our model
1mntpa ethylene capacity in Shandong to utilise its expected net cash balance
sheet We estimate WHC will reach close to net cash by 2019 and the potential
1 mntpa ethylene project will cost about USD4bn (RMB32bn in 2019E based
on our USDRMB exchange rate forecast) If all these projects are realised by
2019E assuming acquiring BC at market replacement cost and new ethylene
capex spend across 2019E-2022E we estimate WHCs net gearing would jump

to c46% by the end of 2019 Hence we see 50% of net gearing level as low
risk for further equity raising
WHCs earnings and target price are sensitive to MDI prices Our sensitivity
analysis suggests for each 5% change in the MDI price 2017E EPS would
change by 9% and our target price would change by 10% correspondingly
The earnings and target price sensitivity beta to MDI is c18-20x WHCs
earnings and target price are also sensitive to the benzene price which is the
biggest cost factor for WHC For each 5% change in the benzene price 2017E
EPS and target price would change by 3% and 4% respectively

WHCs target price is more sensitive to the MDI price than the Benzene price
According to our scenario analysis if the MDI price increases by 15% and the
benzene price decreases by 15% this would raise our target price by 41% to
RMB59 On the other hand if the MDI price goes down by 15% and the
benzene price increases by 15% our target price would fall 41% to RMB249

Our estimates are slightly higher than Bloomberg Finance LP consensus
estimates by 9-11% We believe this is mainly due to our constructive view on
the MDI price trend
MDI price has more influence
than Benzene price on WHCs

ROIC to increase significantly in 2017E
On the back of higher MDI prices and expansion of new chemical product
range we forecast revenue will increase 38% 12% and 14% in 2017E 2018E
and 2019E respectively We estimate GPM should gradually recover from 31%
in 2016 to 40% in 2019E ROIC will also likely rebound sharply to an average of
23% in 2017-19E from 15% in 2016
Figure 63 Key ratios

Source Company data Deutsche Bank estimates
We expect MDI prices and spreads to further strengthen driven by energy
prices recovery slowing global new capacity additions and stable demand
growth We project the PU segments GPM will be 50-56% in 2017E-19E vs
41% in 2016 Functional material and special chemicals are the second growth
than double during 2016-2019 We expect petrochemical projects to run at full
steam in 2017-19 after two years of capacity ramp-up since 2015

Net gearing ratio will drop significantly
On 16 January 2017 WHC issued 116mn new shares at RMB2155share for a
total sum of RMB25bn to develop its new business After deleveraging we
estimate the net gearing ratio will drop to 49% in 2017 from 119% in 2016
With strong cash flow ahead we expect net gearing will drop to 2% if no new
project announced
We expect working capital inflow in 2017 due to an increase in the amount of
trade payables which offset an increase in trade receivables Trade
receivablepayable days will likely remain largely stable but inventory days
should drop to 60 days in 2017E from 74 days in 2015

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
