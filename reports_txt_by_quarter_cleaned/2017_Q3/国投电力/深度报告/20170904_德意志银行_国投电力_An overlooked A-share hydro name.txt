SDIC enjoys higher earnings visibility as well as stability than thermal power
peers due to its 57% capacity exposure to hydropower Over 2016-1H17
almost all the earnings came from the hydro segments Meanwhile SDICs
thermal business can also benefit from accelerating supply-side reform and
year-end tariff hikes We expect SDIC to turn FCF positive starting in 2018
thanks to earnings recovery and better capex discipline indicating potential
upside to our assumed 35% payout ratio and dividend yield of 3% Relative to
Yangtze Power SDIC is an overlooked A-share hydro name with an attractive
valuation and similarly strong hydro capacity pipeline Reiterating Buy
Positive tariff outlook better capex discipline improving free cash flow
SDICs 1H17 results were slightly below expectation with a 1337% yoy
decline in reportedrecurring net profit but still much better than thermal
peers which are near breakeven Thermal tariff recovered by 75% yoy due to
a lower DPS discount Hydro tariff dropped 6% yoy in 1H17 but the declining
trend slowed in the second quarter Management expects the discount to
provincial hydro power sales tariff should benefit from the thermal tariff hike in
July and potentially another round at year-end In response to supply-side
reform SDIC is delaying three coal-fired generation units (total 3GW) and plans
no other thermal capacity additions over 2017-19E We expect its free cash
flow to reach cRmb80bn in 201819E supporting a stable dividend outlook
We revise down our 20171819E net profit forecasts by 14%4%1% to reflect
higher fuel cost delay in thermal projects higher thermal tariff due to a lower
DPS discount and July tariff hike and lower hydro tariff due to higher discount
Our TP is based on DCF with WACC of 70% and zero TGR SDIC is trading at
12x 2018E PE and 15x PB well below Yangtzes 17x PE and 23x PB Risks
lower-than-expected thermal tariff hike weaker water flow higher coal prices

An undervalued hydro name
As of the end of 1H17 SDIC has a total of 296GW 57% of which is hydro
plants Its hydro assets are mainly concentrated in Yalongjiang Sichuan
(147GW) Yunnan (14GW) and Gansu (660MW) Over 2016-1H17 the hydro
business contributed almost all the reported earnings and provides SDIC with
higher earnings visibility and stability than thermal power peers
Hydro tariff discount to narrow with upside following thermal tariff hikes
In 1H17 the hydro tariff dropped 6% yoy due to a higher discount for market-
based volume But on a quarterly basis the tariff decline slowed down in the
second quarter (-8% yoy in 1H -4% yoy in 2H) Management expects the
We believe the intra-provincial power sales (especially for Jinping and Guandi)
could also enjoy some tariff upside following the thermal tariff hike in July
2017 Moreover the year-end thermal tariff hikes will provide further hydro
tariff upside
Thermal tariff discounts narrow supply-side reform drives structural recovery
In 1H17 SDICs average thermal tariff recovered by 75% yoy due to a lower
DPS discount According to the management this is due to more rationalized
bidding with more coordination between peers and higher coal prices
Management estimates an Rmb07centskwh average thermal tariff hike in
July 2017 and expects the year-end fuel cost pass-through to be executed we
hold the same view
In recent few months we have witnessed an acceleration in supply-side
reform in the thermal power sector with more capexcapacity expansion
discipline at a nationwide level and a more stringent control over captive
power plants by local governments These measures together with the
requirements to release advanced coal production capacity will create a more
positive outlook for the thermal sector over 2018-19
Better capex discipline to support improving free cash flow
According to management in response to the supply side reform SDIC has
delayed several thermal projects Meizhouwan II unit 3 (1GW) is delayed to
end-2017 and the Beijiang project (2GW) is delayed to 2018 Besides the
3GW no other coal-fired capacity will be added during 2H17-2019
With more capex discipline we expect SDIC to be able to have Rmb80bn
positive free cash flow in 201819 which will support its 35% dividend payout
ratio as well as a 3% dividend yield

1H17 recurring net profit dropped 37% yoy to Rmb1290mn mainly dragged
by a 60% yoy increase in unit fuel cost partially offset by a 6% higher net
power output and 8% drop in financial cost At the pre-tax profit level
Rmb33bn is from hydro and a loss of Rmb02bn is made in the thermal
1H17 hydro output increased slightly by 2% However the hydro tariff dropped
6% yoy due to a higher discount for market-based volume

Earnings revisions valuation and risks
We lower our net profit forecast in 20171819E by 14%4%1% mainly to
reflect the following changes
4% higher thermal tariff in 2017-19E to reflect a lower DPS discount
and the mid-year tariff hike effective on 1 July 2017
3% lower hydro tariff in 2017E to reflect higher DPS discounts offered
by hydro plants a 1% higher hydro tariff in 2018E to reflect tariff hikes
for inter-provincial power sales after the thermal tariff hike
10-15% lower wind tariff in 2017-19E to reflect higher price discounts
to market-based volume
8%3%3% higher unit fuel cost in 20171819E to reflect the latest
coal price trends
Delay of Meizhouwan II unit 3 to end-2017 delay of Beijiang project
(2GW) to Jul 2018
We lower our TP slightly to Rmb85 (from Rmb87) it is derived from a DCF
with a WACC of 70% and a zero terminal growth rate
SDIC is trading at an attractive 12x 2018E PE and 15x 2018E PB which is
much lower than the 17x PE and 23x PB of its hydro peer Yangtze Power
Besides its thermal segment can also benefit from the acceleration in supply-
side reform as well as the potential thermal tariff hike at year-end Reiterating
Key risks include higher-than-expected coal prices lower-than-expected year-
end tariff hike uncertainties in hydro utilization hours

Supply side reform to support structural recovery in
The supply-side reform initiated by the NEA is progressing well with several
successive polices issued at centrallocal government level to control the
oversupply since 1H16 On top of the demand recovery and narrowing tariff
discount for market-based volume better capex discipline and slow capacity
expansion are helpful for a structural improvement in the thermal power sector
1H17 power sector data released by the China Electricity Council (CEC)
suggests a much slower thermal capacity expansion (halved yoy) stronger-
than-expected investment discipline and a recovery in China power demand
which confirms our positive view on structural improvement in the thermal
power sector despite an unchanged coal price headwind in the absence of a
timely tariff hike (See more details in Supply side reform in thermal power
better than expected published on 26 July 2017)
On 26 July 16 Ministries of central government jointly issued a notice
Pushing for supply-side reform to mitigate oversupply risks of thermal power
with the main content including
To phase out those 300MW units that do not meet the requirement
To suspend constructionoperations of those thermal projects that are
without the legitimate approvals
To stop capacity expansions in those provinces with alarm levels of
To cut new capacity by half for projects that transmit power to other
Furthermore in the notice the government targets to suspenddelay 150GW
capacity and phase out 20GW coal-fired power capacity during 2016-20E By
2020 coal-fired capacity is to be controlled within 1100GW (vs 943GW at end-
2016) This notice shows the governments continuous efforts and
determination to control thermal capacity expansions which will help to create

a more favorable operational environment for the thermal power sector over
Moreover we have witnessed an acceleration of coal mine approvals which
echoes government action to release the advanced coal production capacity
We summarize coal project approvals in July-Aug in the below table which
add up to 82mn tonsyear production capacity We believe the acceleration of
coal production capacity release is helpful to easing the supply shortage and
therefore putting pressure on coal prices

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
