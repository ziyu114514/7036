Dierentiated ad leader riding on new
consumption growth (Revised)
Growth correlated to the new economy
We initiate coverage of Focus Media with a Buy rating and a target price of
RMB14 implying 35% upside potential Focus Media has recently been included
in the MSCI-A and is a leading player in Chinas ad industry with dominant
market share in two channels of advertising (1) inner building media (90%) and
(2) cinema screens (pre-movie advertising) Compared to traditional channels of
advertising such as TV etc these two channels achieve greater impact given they
are in conned areas holding the captive attention of viewers These channels
are favored by leading internetFMCF clients such as JD Ali Baidu and PG
etc which contribute approximately 50% of FMs revenue We view FM as well-
positioned to ride the growth of Chinas new economy We project a prot CAGR
of 20% against peers 10-15%
Inner building media the only growing traditional advertisement channel
While the growth of other traditional advertisement channels such as TVradio
newspapers has dropped in the past few years we have seen building media
growing internet advertising building media is more eective in delivering the
message to targeted groups of consumers and raising overall brand awareness
Focus Media dominates the building media market with market share of more
than 90% We expect inner building segment revenue to generate a CAGR of
16% in 2017-19E driven by c12% screen expansion and a 4% increase in ASP
We believe Focus Medias screens (both LCD and poster frame) will continue to
its screens
Cinema media riding on Chinas movie screen growth
Focus Media has 60% market share in theater advertisements (ads before the
movie) in China We have noticed robust growth in this segment in the past few
years (65%42%51% yoy revenue growth in 2014-2016) thanks to signicant
growth in Chinas movie screens which have doubled to more than 40000
from only 20000 in 2014 As this segment is correlated with the movie screen
expansion we estimate that cinema media revenue CAGR to be 13% in 2017-19E
in line with our estimate of overall movie screen growth

Capturing Chinas leading
Outdoor channel mix is increasing
We have noticed that the advertising industry has remained attish for the past
three years as shown in the table below and we forecast the industry will keep
a 2% CAGR for the next 3-4 years
However the advertising channel mix has changed signicantly over the past
ve years As shown in the chart below traditional channels for advertising
expenditure have shifted signicantly from traditional ones such as TV
newspapersradio etc to outdoors (162% in 2016 including building LCD and
frame posters) or the internet
Internet advertising revenue showed an average of c 20% yoy growth for the past
four years If we break down the internet channel the mobile channel has surged
signicantly in recent years It seems that more users prefer mobile terminals
and as a result the percentage of internet advertising expenditure on mobile
terminals as a percentage of the total has risen to more than 50% from only
6% in 2009
On the other hand as shown in Figure 3 revenue of inner building LCDposter
frame and cinema media (where Focus Media is focused) also enjoyed growth of
c 20% and c 50% respectively for the past four years

Building media dominant
A much more ecient channel
Focus Medias advertising channel is mainly residential and business building
media in tier 1 and tier 2 cities in China LCD displays and poster frames are
installed inside a lift or on the wall of a lift waiting area According to data from
EntGroup Focus Media dominates the lift LCDposter frame media market with
by 60% market share as of 2016
Question 1 why choose the lift as the advertisement channel
Most people will have to spend 2-5 minutes inside the lift
Focus Media specically chooses premiumnew residential or business
models in tier 1-2 cities to guarantee their potential targeted clients who
have the consumption power
This makes Focus Medias posters more eective in penetrating the right
individual customers and increases the eciency for their advertising
Question 2 who are the clients looking for Focus Media
As we illustrate in the table below Focus Medias major clients are from sectors
such as the internet and FMCG Key clients include Alibaba Taobao and PG
etc Internet and FMCGs total revenue contribution is 40-50% in 2015-2016 as
shown in the table below

Unlike other traditional media channels such as TVmagazineradio that target
the mass market (everyone can access to those media channel) Focus Medias
channel is more focused on 1) mid-to-high-end residential buildings and
business buildings and 2) tier 1 and 2 cities Those residents and tenants living
than mass market consumers across China As a result leading internet FMCG
they launch a new product or new marketing campaign program simply because
this is a more ecient way to test the consumer market

Investors may ask whether given continuing internet penetration and especially
with more and more people using smartphones in China Focus Medias oine
channel will be threatened We believe the impact on Focus Media will be limited
There are several dierences between the internet and and Focus Media in terms
1) Passive vs active Compared with the active way of pushing the advertisement
to the screen the way internet advertisement does Focus Media uses a passive
Deutsche Bank AGHong Kong
19 September 2017
Hotels  Leisure  Gaming
way As we mentioned above consumers are conned within a space with
no signal for a few minutes and therefore they are passively receiving the
information from the display of Focus Medias advertisements By contrast
internet advertising may not be as ecient because consumers can choose to
avoid receiving or ignore the advertisement pushed through to their smartphone
2) Barrier to entry high vs low Generally speaking oine advertising is much
to use the internet as their mainstream way of advertising their products The
advantage of internet advertisements is that the fees are relatively aordable and
for the year of 2017 The charge for 15 seconds in cities like ShanghaiBeijing is
c RMB 130-270CPM depending on the channels

Meanwhile its barrier to entry is also low in that any brand or product regardless
of whether it is small or big fake or real can cast their advertisements to any
consumers because internet advertising is dicult to track
sector as their clients We listed the rate card for Focus Medias LCD display in

Our forecast on building media growth
Whilst dicult to track core earnings drivers
We believe the core drivers for Focus Media should be 1) number of clients and
its rate card prices up by 20% and discounted prices by 7-10% for their clients
every year its dicult for investors to track the growth from its customers and
their spending because the contract is condential
we modeled growth by looking at the annual growth of its building media
As a result we believe using alternative drivers to forecast Focus Medias growth
reports its building media screen growth every year We believe advertisement
revenue from its clients can alternatively be reected in the growth of its 1) screen
number (both LCD and poster frames) and 2) per screen revenue contribution
We are forecasting revenue CAGR of 16% for building media
Our forecast is primarily based on two segments 1) LCD screens and 2) poster
frames Under each segment we further break down the growth by 1) expansion
of its screenposter frame number and 2) per screenposter frame revenue
Expansion of LCDposter frames In 1H17 Focus Media has 225000 LCD
screens covering 90cities and 114 million poster frames covering 50 cities in
China As Focus Media currently primarily targets tier 1 and 2 cities we believe
there is still high potential for its screens to penetrate tier 3 or lower cities More
importantly with their internetFMCG clients aiming to penetrate more in China
we believe Focus Media will also cover more areas in China
Increasing per screen revenue This is attributable to two factors 1) like-for-
like price hikes and 2) higher utilization of its screens Management guided that
although the card rate price is likely to have 20% growth yoy the discounted price
per screen utilization (capacity)
Every LCD will repeat its advertisement for 20 min during 20 hours every
Clients can buy Focus Medias advertisement time (minimum unit is 15

Currently for its LCD screens the utilization rate for each screen is c
60% (tier 1 cities utilization rate is c 90-100% per our channel check
while tier 2 cities utilization is c 30-40%)
Our forecasts by segment
LCD - we are forecasting a 2017-19E CAGR of 9% for the number of LCD
display screens and a 2017-19E CAGR of 4% for ASP
Poster Frame - we are forecasting a 2017-19E CAGR of 15% for the
number of poster frames and a 2017-19E CAGR of 4% for ASP
Other media (mainly shopping malls and billboards) - contributes less
than 4% of total revenue we are forecasting a 2017-19E CAGR of 5%
for such business revenue growth

Riding the robust movie screen growth
Focus Media leases movie screens and casts its advertisements before a movie
starts (pre-movie advertising) Cinema media in China is dominated by only four
players with Focus Media having the largest market share with 60% followed by
Wanda Film with 20% China Film Group and Jinmao share the remaining 20%
market share As of 1H17 Focus Media had already signed a contract with more
than 1610 cinemas with more than 10600 movie screens in China across 290

Fixed rent cost no revenue share with cinema
In terms of the business model Focus Media doesnt share the revenue with the
cinema Similar to building media cinema media is also a leveraged business
Focus Media will sign a lease contract for the movie screen with the cinema for
a xed cost and advertisement revenue above the rent cost is the prot In terms
of the rate card price for example Beijings price is c RMB1m for 15 seconds
of advertisement per week
We forecast revenue CAGR to be 13% in 2017-19E
The rapid growth in cinema media revenue in the past three years was mainly
driven by theater expansion in China (over 25% yoy growth during 2013-2016)
Therefore we believe the growth in movie screens signed by Focus Media in
2017-19E will be in line with our China movie screen growth forecast
Our forecast for cinema media is based on our forecast of Chinas movie
screen growth and per screen advertisement
After the rapid expansion of movie theaters in China during 2013-2016
saw total movie screens signed by Focus Media increase only by 6% to
c 10600 as of 1H17 from c 10000 as of 2016 (note that signed movie
screens increased by 28% to c 8300 as of 1H16 from c 6500 as of
Media revenue per screen (c RMB02m) has remained quite stable over
the past three years We believe such a trend will continue in 2017-19E
Therefore we estimate that cinema media revenue growth will be
14%12%12% yoy in 20171819E which is in line with our China movie
screen growth forecast

Cost analysis mostly the
rent cost - which is xed
Like-for-like rental cost remains stable
The rental cost of Focus Media accounts for 70-75% of its total operating cost
Given that Focus Media dominates the inner building LCDposter frame media
channel with 90%70% market share we believe that 1) its bargaining power is
strong over its upstream and 2) its gross margin will continue to be stable
cost is occurred when Focus Media rents advertising spots from property
Inner building media - as we mentioned before property management
Cinema media - in addition even after large consolidations in recent
account for less than 40% of market share)
As a result we believe that like-for-like rental costs will be stable due to
Focus Medias strong bargaining power
Total costs will increase by the same growth rate as the topline mainly
driven by the expansion of media screens
With the stable level of its operating cost total margin of c 71% remains

Initiating coverage with Buy price target RMB14
We initiate coverage of Focus Media with a Buy rating Our DCF-based target price
is RMB14 implying 35% upside potential at current levels As the dominant player
in inner building media we argue that Focus Media should trade at a premium
to its regional peers
DCF-based valuation
We derive our target price based on a DCF valuation Focus Medias operations
dominates the market for inner building media in China As a result we believe
DCF is the best way to value Focus Media from a long-term perspective Our key
valuation assumptions include
WACC of 98%
cash position at the moment with very small amount of interest-bearing
Cost of equity of 103%
A risk-free rate of 39% and a market risk premium of 56% (in line with

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
