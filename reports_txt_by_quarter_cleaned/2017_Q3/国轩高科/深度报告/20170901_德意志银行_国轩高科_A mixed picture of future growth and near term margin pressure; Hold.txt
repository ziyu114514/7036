A mixed picture of future growth and
near term margin pressure Hold
Optimistic on the long term outlook despite short term hiccup
Guoxuan High-tech delivered at YoY sales revenue and -17% YoY NPAT drop
in 1H17 which was attributed to 1) uninspiring downstream battery demand
led by EV policy change 2) batteries contract ASP decline and 3) upstream raw
the long run Guoxuan is planning to strengthen its market-leading position to
beneciary of the rising EV tide in China In our view the current share price has
largely factored in the expected strong growth in the future maintain Hold

1H17 results at the low end of guidance
stayed roughly at YoY at RMB24bn mainly due to lukewarm downstream
demand from EV bus In the meantime NPAT arrived at RMB445mn (down -17%
YoY) in 1H17 representing 36% of FY17 DBe and 43% of market consensus The
 RMB535m (-185% YoY to 03% YoY) mainly on account of raw material price
hike coupled with declining NMC batteries contract ASP
2017 subsidy scheme putting pressure on battery producers
While the current subsidy scheme favors high quality battery producers in the
long term with capacity acting as the major entry barrier we believe he short term
impact to the battery industry is inevitable As a result of EV policy change China
registered c269k units of EV in 7M17 or merely 385% of market expectation
of 700k units in 2017 Guoxuan a high quality battery producer has booked
RMB635m  695m (-139% YoY to -57% YoY) implying no sign of a signicant
turnaround in the near term
Future growth priced in maintain Hold on margin uncertainty
We cut our 2017DBe EPS by 12% to factor in 165% YoY ASP decline in 2017
while we have already built in conservative volume assumptions Though near
term disappointment Guoxuan will still be a key beneciary of longer term high
EV growth in China We maintain Hold rating for Guoxuan on a mix of future high
growth and near term margin pressure Our target PEx multiple remains at 25x
and set the TP at average EPS of 20172018DBe to factor in the further growth
in 2018 Guoxuans new TP is thus set at RMB313 43% downgrade from our
original TP Major risks include higher-than-expected China EV volume sales and
more-resilient-than-expected ASP trend

Guoxuan is the fourth-largest EV lithium battery player in China with c 10% EV
lithium battery market share in terms of sales in 2016 We believe Guoxuans
grow market share signicantly and make it a major beneciary of the Chinese
governments target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020 However
subsidy scheme change and new EV policy may put pressure on its margin
outlook Hold
As Guoxuan has just listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO we
believe its historical PE band may not reect its high growth and ROE as the
average (excluding the outliers) and we roll forward to average of 20172018E
EPS after factoring in the 1H17 results
Key Industry updownside risks 1) Signicant changes in the Chinese
governments new energy subsidy policy 2) Weakerstronger-than-expected
volume growth in the next three years 3) Quickerslower-than-expected ASP
slower-than-expected ramp-up processing of Hefei third phase and Laixi factories

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
