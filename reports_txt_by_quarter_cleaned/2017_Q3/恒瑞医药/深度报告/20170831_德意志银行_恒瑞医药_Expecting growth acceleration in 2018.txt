Expecting growth acceleration in 2018
Solid growth delivered in 2Q17
Hengrui registered salescore prot of RMB32bn766m in 2Q17 representing
YoY growth of 22%21% This suggests mild acceleration from 19%17% growth
achieved in 1Q17 Export growth was below 20% in 2Q17 according to the
management We highlight the near-term catalysts for Hengrui 1) export growth
acceleration in 2H172018 driven by new products launches in the US 2) we
expect apatinib to add another leg of growth following NRDL implementation
starting from 3Q17 and 3) three potential blockbuster launches in 2019 including
19K pyrotinib and nab-paclitaxel We reiterate Buy on rich pipeline and earnings
growth visibility
Domestic growth in line with expectation ASP erosion
Growth in the oncologyanestheticscontrast agents segments stood at
sub-20%20%30% in 1H17 vs 36%19%30% in 2016 We attribute the solid
performance to fast ramp-up of contrast agents IoversolIodixanol while cancer
drugs recorded growth moderation due to tender ASP pressure and law of large
numbers Management indicated that price renegotiation at the hospital level
aected 1H17 results
On margins and pipeline progress
GM came in at 864% in 2Q17 down from 877% in 2Q16 primarily due to ASP
pressure in drug tenders Nevertheless OPM expansion was recorded despite
the GM contraction from 266% in 2Q16 to 276% in 2Q17 Management
attributed the margin expansion to lower selling and promotion expenses and
admin cost savings RD expenditure was 123% in 2Q17 vs 93% in 2Q16
as more late-stage trials were initiated Management indicated that near-term
pipeline priorities are pyrotinib and camrelizumab The majority of its potential
blockbusters are in the phase 3 stage including pyrotinib P3 for mBC apatinib
P3 for NSCLCLC and camrelizumab for ECLC
Raising target price to RMB605 from RMB585 risks
Our RMB605 target price is based on 43x 2018E EPS vs the 42x we used
previously We believe the multiple is justied as its A-share peers are trading at
29x 2018E EPS with 14% growth in 2019 (vs the 27% we model for Hengrui)
We believe the premium is justied given the superior pipeline upside potential
from exports and potential earnings growth acceleration driven by blockbuster
launches Key risks include product launch delays and price cuts

Hengrui continued solid growth in 1H17 with sub-20%20%30% YoY
36%19%30% in 2016 For 2H17 management expects the apatinib inclusion in
NRDL to add another leg of growth despite the 36% ASP cut vs most recent
tender prices We summarize the key drivers and catalysts below
Exports Growth in 1H17 was below 20% in 1H17 as a result of limited
new product launches in overseas markets and law of large numbers
for cyclophosphamide and sevourane Management expects to see a
growth breakout during 201819 as more pipeline drugs are expected
to receive approval in 2H17 Going forward the US remains the primary
focus for exports as a result of a relatively established salespromotion
model and regulatory framework Europe and Japan would be secondary
focuses for Hengrui given limited scale of operations and barriers to entry
We forecast GM expansion from 874% in 2017 to 887% in 2020 as
exports contribution increases
Apatinib The drug achieved RMB800m in sales in 2016 vs RMB280m in
sales in 2015 translating into growth of 190% YoY and a 17% contribution
to its oncology franchise Management is optimistic on achieving its
sales target for FY17 judging from the 1H17 sales performance and
boost from NRDL coverage We continue to expect indication expansion
opportunities for the drug including major cancer types such as NSCLC
and liver cancer Hengrui is currently conducting phase 3 trials on the
above two indications
Pyrotinib Clinical application was recently led (while phase 3 is ongoing)
for breast cancer indication We note that the application was led based
on P2 data and could be the rst Chinese anti-tumor drug approved
based on P2 data As per management the phase 2 trial for pyrotinib
demonstrated superior clinical ecacy vs the control group using Tykerb
(lapatinib) for HER-2 positive breast cancer
Re-submission of 19K and retagliptin 19K application was already re-
is conducting phase 3 trials for retagliptin while guiding that the relling
timeline would be delayed While we believe the Street still expects
relling in 2H17 we pushed back our market launch forecast of retagliptin
to 2020 vs 2018 previously As for 19K it is expected to contribute to the
top line in 2018
Clinical trial update Management indicated that near-term priorities
would be pyrotinib and PD-1 camrelizumab The majority of its potential
blockbusters are in the phase 3 stage including pyrotinib P3 for BC
apatinib P3 for NSCLCLC and camrelizumab for ECLC

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)

debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
