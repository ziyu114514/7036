Updates on middlelate-stage pipeline
Multiple catalysts ahead late-stage pipeline represents 17% market cap by DBe
We update pipeline progress following the meeting with Chairman Sun Major
catalysts are 1) approval of 19K and Abraxane generic by YE17 2) resubmission
of retagliptin in the near term 3) clarity on pyrotinib development including
an earlier submission of marketing approval 4) updates on clinical progress
for camrelizumab and 5) phase 3 data release on Incytes ECHO-301 We also
highlight potential upside from additional US IND approval and clinical progress
Camrelizumab as the largest driver IDO inhibitor provides signicant upside
We have updated our peak sales for camrelizumab to RMB5-6bn in China and
increased the probability of success to 75-85% based on the strong ORR data
from the phase 1 study Four registration trials are being conducted at present
We expect Hengrui to get the rst domestic PD-1 approval with safe data from
sucient number of patients required by the CFDA Additionally we expect IND
approval for its IDO inhibitor from CFDA in the near term following US IND
approval in May We believe it would be signicantly positive to the IO franchise
and we forecast RMB3-4bn peak sales for the IDO inhibitor

Our model indicates that the addressable market for PD-1PD-L1 would be
RMB19bn in China in 2017 and RMB29bn in 2030 representing a CAGR of 15%
NSCLC and GC are likely to be the largest indications due to a large patient base
and unmet medical need Our model is based on 14 tumor types including the
approved indications and major indications being investigated Among domestic
their PD-1PD-L1 with Hengrui being the leader
Our current valuation for the late stage pipeline represents 17% of the market cap
vs 15% as of our rst attempt in September 2016 Our TP of RMB585 is based
on 42x 2018E EPS We believe 42x is justied as A-share peers are trading at 29x
with 18% EPS growth in 2017 (vs the 24% we model for Hengrui) We believe
the premium is justied given the top China pipeline major upside from exports
and the potential earnings growth acceleration driven by blockbuster launches
Key risks include product launch delays and price cuts

Late-stage pipeline
Revisiting our estimates to reect recent updates
Our updated valuation for the late-stage pipeline represents 17% of the market
cap vs 15% when we rst attempted to value Hengruis late-stage pipeline We
summarize the key changes to our estimates on Hengruis pipeline below
We increased our peak sales estimate for camrelizumab to RMB5-6bn
from RMB12-18bn as we expect substantial opportunities for China-
specic unmet medical needs such as LC GC and EC Our POS is also
four registration trials with initial encouraging data
We added SHR9146 an IDO inhibitor to our analysis While the drug
is pending clinical trial approval by CFDA it has already received IND
approval from the US FDA If successful we estimate peak sales to be
RMB3-4bn We believe this will be a signicant value driver going forward
We increased our peak sales estimate for pyrotinib to RMB2-28bn from
RMB12-16bn Our POS is also revised to 85-95% from 80-90% as we
anticipate Hengrui to le production approval to the CFDA based on
phase 2 data We expect better ecacy data vs T-DM1
For henagliozin we revised our POS to 85-95% from 75-85% as the
For hetrombopag olamine we increased our POS to 80-90% from 70-80%
on public records
We added SHR4640 to our analysis As an URAT1 inhibitor a phase 2 trial
is being conducted for this drug in the treatment of gout
We increased our peak sales estimate to RMB25-3bn from RMB2-25bn
as we are more upbeat on the growth outlook on COPD therapeutics
We removed Exforge generic from the model as we are unable to identify
a new BE study after the withdrawal of the application
We now model NPV of RMB92 per share from these potential
blockbusters vs RMB73 previously in November 2016 and RMB68 at
rst in September 2016 We summarize our estimates in the following
Despite the aforementioned eorts we still believe we undervalued Hengruis
we did not model global opportunities for three drugs in early development in the
IL-17 in the US 3) we did not model US ANDA generic opportunities but expect
signicant upside as it is highly likely Hengrui would address billion-dollar market
opportunities dominated by branded innovative drugs

Camrelizumab the largest value driver in the pipeline
We highlight camrelizumab (SHR1210) is the top priority for the pipeline of
Hengrui There are four registration studies being conducted at present including
a P2 study for classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL) a P3 study for 1L NSCLC a P3
study for relapsedrefractory esophageal cancer and a P23 study for relapsed
refractory liver cancer
These data suggest Hengrui has the largest PD-1 clinical program among all
domestic players Recall recently that CFDA articulated a willingness to approve
IO drugs based on a single arm P2 study however CFDA also made it clear the
approval would also require sucient safe data from a large number of patients
According to management Hengrui is likely to have safety data from 800-1000
patients from all ongoing P23 studies
2017 with a P2 study scheduled to enroll 68 patients (60 in China and the rest
entered P2 in April as well as targeting 90 patients among 29 hospitals For
nivolumab from BMS are in phase 3 while two PD-L1 mAbs atezolizumab from
Roche and durvalumab from AZN are in phase 3 in China We summarize all
ongoing trials of the aforementioned drugs below

Both the ecacy and safety of remimazolam tosilate are expected to be prior
to midazolam and propofol Given that the domestic analgesics drugs market in

Key assumptions of the model
Assume 75% discount vs US pricing and NRDL inclusion
Executives engaged in late stage PD-1 studies believe that the government is likely
to accept a 50% price cut of PD-1 global pricing as an entry point for inclusion
in the NRDL based on our initial discussion with them As such a listed price
of RMB250000 per year is likely for domestic PD-1 translating into an eective
pricing of RMB125000 for six-month therapy with additional courses for free We
model each indication based on the aforementioned prices with RMB125000 as
a price ceiling per patient regardless of treatment duration
Treatment ratio and aordability
To start we believe a treatment ratio of 20% could be reasonable as the number
represents the entire urban population
These assumptions are the largest variables with the highest uncertainty We do
not claim to have a crystal ball while only listing our assumptions in the following
so that buyside could stand on our shoulder to make dierent but appropriate
assumptions
We assume 20% treatment ratio for new cancer patients of each indication
started from 14bn population and incidence ratios
We examined distribution of population covered by three main insurance
schemes distribution of respectively funding consumed as well as the
source of funding We highlight that urban employees which represented
only 21% population consumed 62% of the entire insurance funding
as such we believe a 30% treatment ratio is appropriate to start with
assuming another 10% population would be covered (which would
consume the rest 38% of the insurance funding)
We shave o 13 of the aforementioned numbers to arrive 20% treatment
ratio based on our belief that these pricy oncology drugs would have
a quota system set up by the government payors Recently we have
learned that it is likely a quota system would be introduced for those
drugs included in the new NRDL through negotiation

We believe 60% affordability ratio is a reasonable starting point as we assume
patients would have to pay at least 20% out-of-pocket fees which include
an additional RMB25000 (assume RMB125000 effective price per treatment
A recent survey included 14594 cancer patients in China who received
treatment between 2012-2014 The results indicated that average
of USD8607 Assuming a USDCNY rate of 7 this represents treatment
expense of RMB68173 per annum Additionally the survey indicated
that self-pay is about 788% translating into out-of-pocket payment of
RMB54000 (HY Huang et al Chin J Cancer (2017) 3641)
We assume an additional RMB25000 price tag would reduce the
available number of patients by 13 which ends with approximately 67%
aordability ratio
We took an additional 7% cut on this as the survey was based on 37
tier 1 hospitals from 13 provinces Recall our previous assumption for
treatment ratio include patients from rural area which may not have the
We generally use clinical data from US pivotal studies However we adjusted key
data based on feedback we received from physicians so far including
We reduce duration of treatment to 8 months for 1L NSCLC from 103
months demonstrated in KN-024 (pembrolizumab P3 study) We have
learned that response rate is lower at EGFR- patients from PD-1chemo
would be much dierent in PD-L1 high level patients we lower duration
of treatment in order to be cautious
We reduce duration of treatment to 4 months for 1L melanoma from
61 months demonstrated from KN006 (pembrolizumab) and CM-066
(nivolumab) We have learned that ORR ranges from 20-25% among
Chinese melanoma patients vs 35-40% in US patients We highlight
the dierence resides in disease histology and etiology (please see our
reported published on June 7 ASCO take-aways physician feedback on
IO Chinese studies)
We await further clarity on key Chinese studies on GC NSCLC and HCC to further
adjust this assumption

Available number of patients for 1L vs 2L2L therapy
In our view it is unlikely 100% 2L patients would receive PD-1PDL1 again after
they receive these drugs as 1L therapy While we realize the market opportunity
would be articially lower than actual size by assuming a fraction of 2L patients
as available patients for IO therapy our objective is to assess a proper overall
market size This is the largest dierence between our model vs US model
For gastric cancer meta-analysis suggested 40-60% high PD-L1
expressors among Asian GC patients (Liu et al Onco Targets Ther
(2016) 9 2649-54) As such we assume 100% treatment ratio for all
high expressors and 60% for nonlow expressors Additionally we only
assume 44% of the patients would receive PD-1 in 2L therapy as 1)
aforementioned assumptions leave 20% GC patients as IO nave for 2L
2) we assume 30% patients that received 1L PD-1PD-L1 would receive
these drugs again in 2L
Likewise for NSCLC we assume 60% treatment ratio for nonlow PD-L1
expressors while assuming 51% treatment ratio for 2L patients because
1) our assumptions for 1L leave 30% patients as IO nave for 2L 2) we
assume 30% patients that received 1L PD-1PD-L1 would receive these
drugs again in 2L

Outlook of PD-1PD-L1 treatment
The PD-1 (programmed cell death1) receptor and ligands PD-L1PD-L2 belong to
the family of immune checkpoint proteins which can halt or limit the development
of the T cell response PD1PD-L1 interaction ensures that the immune system
is activated only at the appropriate time in order to minimize the possibility of
chronic autoimmune inammation
The PD1PD-L1 pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism
that is exerted by tumor cells in response to endogenous anti-tumor activity
Two cancer immunotherapy agents targeting the PD-1 receptor has been
marketed Opdivo nivolumab and Keytruda pembrolizumab Both anti-PD-1
Three PD-L1 therapies have been approved by FDA based on signicant clinical
benets in the immuno-oncology space
Overall high response rate vs other therapies
Anti-PD-1 PD-L1 therapies stands out from the traditional anti-tumor inhibitors
on the back of superior ORR (overall response rate) duration of response and
moderate safety prole We summarize the ORR rates for dierent tumor types
udner PD-1PD-L1 therapies as below Notably melanoma has the highest ORR

approval track It targets the PD-1PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the bodys
immune cells and some cancer cells) By blocking these interactions Tecentriq
may help the bodys immune system ght cancer cells
The rst indication approved for atezolizumab was urothelial carcinoma bladder
cancer for patients that failed platinum-containing chemotherapy In April 2017
it was then approved for rst line therapy of UC Meanwhile Tecentriq also
received approval to second line and beyond treatment of NSCLC in October 2016

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by

debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
aected by the currency of an underlying security eectively assume currency risk
