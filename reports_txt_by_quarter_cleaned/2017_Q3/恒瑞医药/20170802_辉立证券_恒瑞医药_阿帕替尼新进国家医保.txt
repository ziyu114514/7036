根據談判，公司主要產品阿帕替尼納入國家醫保乙類，支付標準相比原售價平均
下降37%，但降幅明顯小於進口靶向抗腫瘤藥物。目前全球獲批胃癌靶向藥物僅三
種，因胃癌對個體化治療要求較高，因此已上市藥物市場優勢明顯。
自2014 年底獲批以來，阿帕替尼銷售額高速增長，2016 年即已達至85 億元規
模。除胃癌外，公司還在拓展該品種的適應症，包括肝癌、肺癌、乳腺癌等，將進一
步拓展市場空間。此次新進醫保亦有助於其銷量釋放，其於胃癌市場滲透率有望從目
前不足10%升至30%以上。未來獲批新適應症後，銷售額更有望達至二三十億元。
公司近日分別收到英國、德國、荷蘭藥監局通知，批准公司吸入地氟烷在各國的
上市申請。地氟烷目前除了原研外，沒有仿製藥獲批上市，競爭格局良好，因此將有
望快速佔領市場，成為又一個繼環磷醯胺式的高毛率品種。而且，因為利用同一生產
線，該品種還成功進入第21 批優先審評名單，將加速國內上市步伐，進而補充公司麻
2017 年以來，公司在美國上市品種新增阿曲庫銨、多西他賽，獲批總數達至8
個，在歐洲市場則已獲批卡泊芬淨、七氟烷。總體上，公司製劑出口產品線不斷擴
充，獲批速度加快，未來兩年還有5-8 個品種有望獲批，並不排除類似環磷醯胺的重
磅品種獲批，這將明顯提升公司競爭力，帶動國際業務迎來30以上增速的高增長

還值一提的是，目前國內醫藥政策包括仿製藥一致性評價、優先審評等將
