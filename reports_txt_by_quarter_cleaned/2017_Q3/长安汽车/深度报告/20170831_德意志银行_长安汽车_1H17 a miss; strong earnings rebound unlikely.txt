1H17 a miss strong earnings rebound
16% YoY 1H17 prot drop on declining sales volume at local brand and JVs
Changan Auto released its 1H17 results after market close on 30 August The
decline in Changan brand sales volume to 729k units 1H17 gross prot margin
local brands and consequent price promotions in our view Meanwhile there
was a 264% YoY earnings contribution decline from its JVsassociates caused
by 119% YoY sales volume drop at Changan Ford JV probably due to aging
product portfolio and exhaustion of small-engine car demand after cutback in
tax incentive in our view Yet helped by an increase in government subsidies
Changans 1H17 net prot only fell by 159% YoY to RMB46bn
Deutsche Bank view  unexciting portfolio unlikely to drive a 2H17E prot
With the originally popular products sales going downhill and a lack of new killer
products in sight especially at the major earnings contributor Changan Ford we
Hence we trim our FY17-19E net revenue by 58-61% on lower local brand sales
assumption We also cut our FY17-19E net prot by 67-72% mainly on 1) lower
Changan Ford amid weak model sales partially oset by an increase in subsidy
We value Changan at 70x FY18E PE (roll-over from 70x FY1718E) which is
we expect Changan to suer mild net prot decline going forward (-2% FY16-19E
CAGR) vs strong growth in the past (45% FY13-16 CAGR) Given a lack of share
price upside vs our target price we maintain our Hold rating Key downside risks
include 1) weaker-than-expected vehicle sales 2) pricing pressure  and 3) worse-
than-expected local brand protability Key upside risks include 1) better-than-
expected new and old models sales  and 2) a stronger-than-expected earnings
rebound at the local brand

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
