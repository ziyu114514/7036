1H17 weakness as guided recovery
path still full of challenges
1H17 prot in line with preliminary announcement margins aected by rising
Great Wall Motors (GWM) 1H17 net prot was marginally lower than its
YoY gross revenue decline to RMB413bn on meager 07% YoY sales volume
GWMs 1H17 net prot decreased by 509% YoY to RMB24bn with a signicant
62ppt decline in net prot margins due to 1) the aforementioned discounting
2) higher marketing expenses and 3) higher RD expenses according to the
On a quarterly basis GWM booked a 137% YoY decline (231% QoQ drop) in
2Q17 gross revenue due to a 47% YoY decrease (187% QoQ decline) in vehicle
sales Operating prot margins plunged on a YoY and QoQ basis probably due
to deep 2Q17 price cuts and upfront new product launch costs in our view On
in 2Q17 net prot
Management still expects margins to recover on new models
GWM hosted a conference call on 25 August The key takeaways are as follows
Management maintains its full-year sales target of 125m units on higher
new Haval H6 sales and contribution from WEY brand although they
acknowledge the challenges in attaining that target Monthly sales of new
volume to pick up further
VV7 SUV is in short supply after launch given strong demand Great
Wall targets monthly sales of 10k units of VV7 and 15k units of VV5
According to management gross prot margins for the two models are
targets increasing 4S dealership stores to c100 by year-end and by 200
by next year from the current c40 stores
Our price target is based on a target 7x
FY18E PE (from 7x FY1718E) Key upside
risks are stronger-than-expected new model
sales and a margin rebound (see page 2 for

revamps of existing models such as the Haval H6 Sporty and Haval H2
Despite higher labor promotion and RD cost base GWM expects
margin trends to gradually improve in 2H17 with the sales ramp-up of
the newly-launched new generation Haval H6 and WEY VV7 as well as
the WEY VV5 which should achieve better-than-average margins after
The third Xushui plant with annual capacity of 200k units began
operation in April of this year for the production of the new H6 and VV7
models along with the to-be-launched VV5
GWM participates we envision escalating costs for GWM in defending their
market position Although GWM will attempt to regain SUV market share and
restore margins by oering more models and the upscale WEY brand with
enhanced features we believe ongoing price pressure and cost ination in various
initial demand for WEY products Therefore we maintain Sell ratings on GWMs
H shares and its A shares
We lower our FY17-19 revenue and net prot estimates by 26-83% and
84-147% respectively in consideration of GWMs weaker-than-expected sales
70x FY18E PE (rolled over from 70x FY1718E PE ) which is below Great Walls
historical H-share trading average considering a lack of long-term EPS growth
We believe our target multiple is justied given a FY16-19E three-year EPS CAGR
of -1% Our target price also implies FY18E PBV of 11x which seems well
supported by a sustainable ROE of about 16-17% Key upside risks are stronger-
than-expected new model sales and a margin rebound

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
