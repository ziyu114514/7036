Passenger NEV  higher opex but nice
progress reiterating Buy
IA ahead of expectations passenger NEV has started to make progress
Inovances 1H result (NP up 10% YoY) tracks behind our full-year estimates
dragged by surging opex associated with the passenger NEV business However
up two positive surprises 1) stronger-than-expected IA growth in 1H and
sustainable 30-50% growth guided by management going forward and 2) an
encouraging breakthrough in the passenger NEV business with 6-7 customers
secured in 1H With continuing strength in IA an NEV bus recovery opex
normalization and rising contributions from passenger NEV and industrial robots
we believe earnings growth is set to accelerate We maintain Buy
Strong 1H top-line growth partially oset by margin contraction
1H net prot of Rmb429m (10% YoY) achieved 36% of our full-year estimate
which tracks behind the 5-year average of 43% GP margin contracted 33ppt to
458% driven mainly by the new energy segment (down 182ppt YoY) This along
with higher-than-expected opex (RD expense 75% YoY and selling expense
41% YoY) partially oset strong top-line growth in 1H (32% YoY) In 2Q alone
sales growth moderated to 29% YoY from 38% YoY in 1Q while NP growth visibly
slowed to 3% YoY (from 24% YoY in 1Q) largely due to surging opex
Stronger-than-expected IA growth a key positive
Sales of general IA products (servos and inverters) soared 90% YoY in 1H way
ahead of Chinas overall market growth (15% for inverters and 23 % for servos
in 1H) managements full-year guidance (30-50%) and our full-year estimates
(50-60%) Inovances vertical-based strategy continued to facilitate its market
GPM contracted while opex surged
GPM contraction was mainly because of 1) ASP cuts (10-20% by Yutong) low
sales volume and higher sales rebates in the NEV segment and 2) an unfavorable
product mix in the inverter segment (ie rising contributions from low-margin
auxillary elevator products and high-voltage inverters) The big jump in opex was
mainly due to a passenger NEV business expansion with the RD expense ratio
(as a percentage of sales) rising to a historical high of 14% in 1H Such a surge
however is likely to be a one-time event as management expects the ratio to
normalize to 8-10% starting in 2018
Guidance by segment is upbeat encouraging breakthrough on new businesses

Shenzhen Inovance Technology Co Ltd
At Fridays post-result conference call management gave an update of the
latest progress in new business development and provided guidance segment by
General IA products to sustain high growth New order growth albeit
(50% YoY) Looking ahead management expects its general inverter
and controller business to sustain 30% growth while general servo
sales keeps growing at a pace of 50% as Inovance views automation
upgrades as a secular growth driver of the segment
NEV segment to be back on track in 2H Despite headwinds from Yutong
in 1H logistics NEV and non-Yutong NEV bus businesses were on track to
achieve the full-year target New orders from Yutong in June and July have
already shown a visible recovery (a 50% YoY increase) Management
retains its full-year guidance of 30% for the segment (DBe 30%)
Heavy investment in passenger NEV has started to show progress
Being the rst local player to successfully roll out automated production
lines and obtain the ISO26262 certication (the highest safety standard for
auto electronic systems) for the passenger NEV drive Inovance managed
to secure 5-6 tier-2 passenger NEV customers to supply its controller
products and 1 customer for its powertrain products Management is
condent that they can secure 1-2 tier-1 passenger NEV customers in
2H17 and expects the business to take o in 2019 In the longer term
management expects third-party OEMs to take a bigger share of Chinas
passenger NEV powertrain market Inovance is likely to stand out in terms
Industrial robotics to emerge as a new growth driver in long term In
1H Inovance successfully expanded its robot product oering Its new
products are also massively being tested by customers in verticals like
mobile phone manufacturing and lithium batteries
Maintaining Buy risks
We cut our 2017 earnings estimate by 11% after modeling in stronger-than-
expected IA growth in 1H (lifting revenue by 3%) but more conservative opex
assumptions We keep our 2018-19 forecasts largely unchanged and retain our
DCF-based target price of Rmb301 (WACC8% and TGR 2%) Key risks slower-
than-expected NEV growth and an IA demand recovery

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
aected by the currency of an underlying security eectively assume currency risk
