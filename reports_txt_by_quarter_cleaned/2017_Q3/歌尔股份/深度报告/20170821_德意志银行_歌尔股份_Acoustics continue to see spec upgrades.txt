Goertek released solid 2Q17 results (EPS up 52% YoY) and positive 3Q17
guidance (EPS up 12% to 49% YoY) Both are largely in line with Bloomberg
consensus The firm is positive on the 2018 outlook backed by continued
acoustic upgrades (stereo waterproof upgrade) and VR headset organic
growth We share similar views on the strong top-line growth but remain
concerned that GPM could keep trending down (on a YoY basis) as low-
Strong 2Q17 operating results owing to better product mix
Goertek reported 2Q17 EPS of RMB014 (52% YoY 40% QoQ) and
operating profit of RMB622mn (53% YoY 50% QoQ) on sales of RMB55bn
(41% YoY 22% QoQ) Operating profit beat DB estimate and consensus by
21% owing to tight opex control and GPM expansion (up 06ppt QoQ to 224%
vs DBe 214%) Dragged down by forex loss EPS only came in line with
expectations Goertek attributes strong GPM to better product mix (higher
contribution from acoustics) Acoustic sales (speakerreceiver MEMS
microphone earpod) grew 65% YoY owing to spec upgrade (water-proofing
stereo sound Lightning connector) and market share gain as well as a low
base in 2Q16 (the weak iPhone 6S cycle) The assembly business grew 35%
YoY mainly powered by VR headset assembly despite legacy TVgame
console peripheral assembly on a YoY declining trend
The firm delivered a positive tone for 2H17 and 2018 outlook
Goertek expects 3Q17 net profit between RMB629m (12% YoY) and RMB
836m (49% YoY) driven by new iPhone launch and organic demand growth
for VR headsets The guidance is largely in line with DBe and consensus For
2018 Goertek highlights three key growth drivers 1) the acoustic industry will
post 25% YoY growth mainly driven by Android vendors playing the catch-up
game on top of mild spec upgrades from iPhone 2) new VR headset launches
from key clients (Oculus and Sony) We believe Oculus is likely to launch a
standalone device that can work independently (without being tethered to a
PC) and 3) rising demand for smart speakers and wireless headphones
Valuation and investment risks
We raise our 2017-19 EPS forecasts by 5% to 6% and accordingly raise our TP
from RMB18 (22x 2017 EPS) to RMB202 (22x one-year FW EPS) 22x PER
represents 08x PEG in line with regional peers Upsidedownside risks include

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
