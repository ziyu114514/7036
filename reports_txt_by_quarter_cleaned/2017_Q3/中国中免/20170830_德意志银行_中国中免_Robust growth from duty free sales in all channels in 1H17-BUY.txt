Robust growth from duty free sales in
all channels in 1H17-BUY
More details disclosed in the interim result following the preliminary result
CITS announced its interim report this evening Although CITS already announced
its preliminary earnings growth of 168% yoy to RMB129bn and top line growth
of 225% yoy to RMB126bn a couple of weeks before we managed to see the
more detailed drivers behind the earnings growth through its interim result report
We believe a 44% top-line growth from its duty free business (retail segment) is
in 1H17 with RMB 136 billion revenue contribution
Key highlight duty free revenue up by 44% yoy
Duty free business - revenue up by 44% to RMB66bn in 1H17 from
RMB46bn in 1H16
Hai  tang Bay revenue grew by 213% to RMB31bn in 1H17 from
RMB26bn in 1H16
Airportsports duty free stores revenue grew by 74% yoy to RMB34bn
in 1H17 from RMB20bn in 1H16 Investor need to notice that Sunrise
was consolidated in this segment in 1H17 Duty free sales from Sunrise
contributed RMB136bn If we exclude that on a like for like basis CITSs
airportports duty free growth is c 6% yoy
New airports secured in 1H17 Besides secured the airport duty free
the report that they also won the biddings of entry duty free business in 6
airports (Kunming Guangzhou Tsingdao Nanjing Chengdu and Urumqi)
T  ravel service business - revenue up by 4% to RMB54bn in 1H17
from RMB52bn in 1H16 This was mainly due to the increasing domestic
tourism business (yoy growth of 91%) and ticket agency (more than
doubled yoy) oset by decreasing inbound and outbound tourism
business (yoy drop of 57% and 67%)
We believe CITS valuation is very attractive at 22x19x on our 201718 earnings
forecast as duty-free is a policy-protected and high-barrier-to-entry business in
China CITS valuation is lower than average retailtravel peers in A shares We
derive our RMB 37 TP from a DCF-based valuation (81% WACC 9% cost of
equity beta of 09 and 30% TGR unchanged) Key downside risks include 1)

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
