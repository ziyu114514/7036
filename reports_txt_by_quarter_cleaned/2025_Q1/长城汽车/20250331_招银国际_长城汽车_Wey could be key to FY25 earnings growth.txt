CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Great Wall Motor (2333 HK601633 CH)
Wey could be key to FY25 earnings growth
12-mth Price Performance
Source FactSet
Maintain BUY Great Walls 4Q24 earnings were a mixed bag in our view as
revenue missed but GPM and SGA expenses beat our prior estimates We
believe a stronger model cycle in FY25E than FY24 could be a positive catalyst
for its share price In particular new Wey-brand models could be key to Great
Walls sales volume and profit growth in FY25E We still see room for Great
Walls overseas sales growth as it expands its footprint in Latin America
 4Q24 revenue miss GPM and SGA beat Although Great Walls 4Q24
Jan 2025 its 4Q24 revenue missed our prior forecast by 9% as the
average selling price (ASP) declined QoQ 4Q24 GPM without the warranty
provision adjustment was 191% or 04ppts higher than our projection
4Q24 SGA expenses (incl warranty provision) were about RMB900mn
lower than our forecast Forex loss from ruble depreciation was also lower
than most of its peers
 FY25E outlook We project FY25E sales volume to rise 9% YoY to 135mn
units (10000 units lower than our prior forecast) driven by the Haval and
Wey brands A plethora of new models (likely 3 for Haval and 3 for Wey)
in FY25E and overseas growth (28% YoY to 058mn units in FY25E) are
key to FY25E sales volume in our view We also expect vehicle ASP to
continue rising 1% YoY in FY25E to about RMB143000 aided by higher
sales contribution from Wey
We project Great Walls FY25E gross profit to rise RMB30bn YoY to
RMB425bn with 36% of the growth being from Wey as sales volume
growth from Tank slows down We also expect its net cash position to be
possible forex gain in FY25E could also aid Great Walls net profit Taken
together we cut our FY25E net profit estimates by 5% to RMB131bn as
we revise down its overseas ASP and GPM slightly
 ValuationKey risks We maintain our BUY rating for both A and H shares
Our H-share target price of HK1700 is based on 10x (unchanged) our
revised FY25E EPS and our A-share target price of RMB3200 is based on
Great Walls current AH premium of about 100% (vs the average AH
premium of about 120% in the past 12 months) Key risks to our rating and
target prices include lower sales volume and margins slower tech
transformation than we expect as well as a sector de-rating
