我们首次覆盖国电南瑞并给予买入评级，12个月目标价为人民币290元，隐含26%的
上行空间。我们认为其估值具有吸引力，因为过去三个月里该股股价回调了25%（同
期沪深300指数下跌5%），表现也落后于过去两年受益于欧美电力短缺的其他电力设
备股。然而，我们预计在持续的财政支持下，中国的电网投资（来自国家电网）将达
到人民币6900亿元的记录高点（同比增长13%），略高于人民币6500亿元的年度目
标。我们也看好国电南瑞作为中国主要的二次设备供应商，业务规模和范围最有望受
益于中国智能电网的需求。太阳能和风能在中国电力结构中占比达到15%的关键拐点
后，中国智能电网正处于转型变革的风口浪尖，整合间歇性和波动性可再生能源的挑
战日益严峻，并且可能受益于人工智能电力需求的增长。我们认为，2024-30年国电
南瑞的收入净利润年均复合增长强劲，增速可达10%11%，高于中国8%的电网投资
年均复合增速，这主要得益于智能电网投资结构性增长。
考虑到国电南瑞与国家电网的关系以及稳定的市场格局，该公司可能在特高压换流
阀、电网数字化、调度软件、自动化解决方案以及SVCSTATCOM系统和继电保护等
二次设备领域保持其稳固的主导地位（市场份额为34%-70%）。我们预计，国电南瑞
强劲的财务状况（2024-30年预期毛利率营业利润率为28%16%，净资产回报率领
先，为18%）和以软件为主的收入结构（占2024年预期总收入的40%）将支撑其在中
国工业科技同业中享有估值溢价。我们的目标价基于25倍的2025年预期市盈率，得益

Where we are different (1) Renewables intake as a structural
tailwind to benefit secondary equipment the most
The market may underestimate the longer-term sustainability of grid investment growth
in our view which is often perceived as cyclically driven by policies and project
(especially UHV) construction cycle As we discussed in our report China Grid Tech
Grid transformation From cyclical to structural we believe Chinas grid network is on
the verge of a transformative shift and expect growing renewables in-take in particular
and slight contribution from data center  AI power consumption will likely drive nearly
60% of incremental investments over 2024-2030E with total grid investment increasing
at a robust 8% CAGR and smart grid rising from 137% of total grid spending to 16% in
2030E which will focus on advanced systems to regulate dispatch and process
real-time data for efficient power allocation
Chinas power grids are indeed much newer than those of the EUUS however
renewables just reached 15% of total energy generation in China and we forecast this
to grow to 35% in 2030E Germanys experience is instructive In 2011-2023
Germanys renewable energy share surged from 11% to 39% of total generation
intermittency have been minimal in China potential grid shocks cannot be ignored
Additionally we believe fast-growing AI training  inference capex investment that follow
the trend in US as well as proliferating smart devices for growing charging needs in
China will potentially provide further upside We expect data centers contribution to
total power consumption will rise from 16% in 2023 to 5% in 2030E with AI taking up
around 12% of it

The biggest driver for power grid investment growth now is the relevant intelligent
infrastructure to ensure the smooth integration of renewable energy and reliability of
power system
Smart Power Generation
Renewable energy like wind and solar is volatile and intermittent requiring advanced
grid adjustment systems Coal power is the primary tool for flexibility managing peaks
and troughs in renewable output Nari Tech offers renewable energy generation control
solutions that integrate advanced systems like AGC AVC and FFR to ensure frequency
stability voltage regulation and reliable power quality
Real-time control has replaced traditional scheduling to integrate renewables effectively
Accurate forecasting of renewables output supported by advanced dispatch systems
enhances grid reliability Nari Techs flagship product has been Open-2000 since
establishment and has a dominant position (70-80% market share) in all five levels of
dispatch systemnational regional provincial local and county The new dispatch
system rolled out in 2020 has 20% higher content value than the previous iteration
Substations address challenges like reverse power flow overloading and instability from
distributed renewables Solutions include reactive power devices voltage regulation
tools and equipment upgrades for grid reliability Nari Tech offers relay protection and
SVC (Static Var Compensator)STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) in the
smart substations
Modern distribution networks are shifting to active bidirectional systems Nari Tech
offers intelligent devices like DTUs TTUs FTUs and RTUs to enable fault detection
load forecasting and seamless integration of renewable and EV loads into the grid
Smart Power Consumption
Users actively participate in energy markets by producing consuming and storing
facilitate informed decision-making and demand-side management strengthening grid
efficiency
To address the mismatch between resource-rich areas and demand centers UHV
transmission transfers large-scale clean energy efficiently Nari Tech offers the key
国电南瑞 (600406SS)
We also expect distribution network investments to grow faster than transmission over
2024-30E with distribution investment contribution to increase from 56% of total in
2024E to 59% in 2030E This shift is driven by the need to modernize local grids to
handle distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar and energy storage
use of electric vehicles and other decentralized loads efforts to improve power reliability
图表 16 We believe UHV is the fastest-growing segment in 2025-26E while investments shift towards the digital infrastructure

Where we are different (2) 2025E grid investment to stay strong
but we are slightly above State Grids target
We expect Chinas power grid investment specifically those made by the State Grid
to reach a new high of Rmb690bn in 2025E with continued fiscal support and slightly
above its announced annual target of Rmb650bn as grid investment is often served as a
counter-cyclical economic policy tool eg in 2008-09 and 2015-16 There will be
continued tailwind from equipment upgrade as Implementation Plan for Large-Scale
Equipment Upgrades in Key Energy Areas aims to increase the scale of energy
Among the total investment of Rmb690bn we estimate 44% goes towards transmission
investment (16% UHV and 27% HV) and 66% to distribution

In terms of the fastest-growing segment in 2025E we believe it will be UHV transmission
investments We expect UHV investment to grow 43%13% yoy in 2025E26E as project
approval pace accelerates Compared to four UHV lines starting construction in 2024
we expect at least six lines starting construction in 2025E-26E The fast-growing
upstream renewable energy installation requires advanced planning of UHV projects
(the process from environmental assessment approval budgeting design to
construction typically takes 3-5 years) to prevent the curtailment issue of wind and
solar At the 2025 National Energy Work Conference (Dec 15 2024 link) China
announced plans to prioritize the approval and construction of several key UHV projects
in 2025 including corridors from Western Inner Mongolia to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
Southeastern Tibet to the Greater Bay Area Gansus Badain Jaran Desert to Sichuan
and Southern Xinjiang to Sichuan-Chongqing We expect six new projects starting
construction in 2025E-26E driving the investments to a record high
图表 20 Where will China power grid investment go towards in 2025E
Breakdown of Chinas power grid investment by the State Grid
国电南瑞 (600406SS)
We believe UHV investments will stay elevated beyond 2025E supported by strong
demand to transmit the renewable energy from mega bases despite investment yoy
growth slowing down An UHV line with transmission power of 4-8GW on average can
transmit 10-11GW of renewable energy and 3-4GW of supporting energy The second
batch of projects planned in 14th FYP (150GW of external transmission) will require
15-16 UHV lines relying on five lines already in the installed base and ten additional
new lines (seven lines pending approval) The second batch of projects planned in 15th
FYP (165GW of external transmission) will accordingly require 18-19 UHV lines 15th
strong demand support to continued UHV construction Additionally the State Grid has
also announced reserve projects of five AC line and nine DC lines which we believe will
sustain the UHV construction pace beyond 2025E

On top of UHV growth Nari Tech will also benefit from the penetration of VSC-HVDC
where we forecast relay protection and flexible transmission revenue segment to deliver
25%26% yoy growth in 2025E26E About 4-7 months after the start of project
construction State Grid hosts primary and secondary equipment tendering If Nari Tech
wins the tender it usually takes them about a year to deliver the product in order to book
revenue We think the momentum of strong revenue recognition may sustain into
2026-27E Nari Tech offers converter valves for UHV projects whose significance
among UHV equipment increases from 22% in DC lines to 29% in VSC-HVDC lines

which may lead to the expansion of AI-related power demand
Key catalysts in the past mainly revolve around significant policies targeting the grid
2015 Mar Deepening the Reform of Electric Power System (Document No 9) was
issued to establish an open and transparent electricity market system
2018 Jul Three-Year Action Plan for Blue Sky Defense was introduced
emphasizing the need for UHV networks to reduce air pollution and transition to

sharing and energy efficiency
2020 May New infrastructure initiatives listed UHV transmission as one of the key
focus areas
2020 Sep Chinas pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 brought further
support for renewable energy and grid modernization
2021 Jun NDRC announced that starting from January 2022 new onshore wind and
solar projects would transition to grid-parity pricing instead of subsidies
2022 Dec NDRC and NEA jointly released a roadmap to accelerate the
development of a unified electricity market across China
The two red-shaded boxes in the chart below represent phases of share price decline
The first decline coincided with a broader market sell-off aligned with the CSI300 index
downturn while the second can be attributed to renewable energy subsidy phase-out

Further upside may be driven by AI demand
its contribution rising from 1%-2% to 3%-4% of global power consumption This is mainly
due to AI queries consuming up to 10X more power than traditional queries (report link)
Our GS team estimates that US data center demand will more than triple by 2030E
driven by hyperscalers capex growth (report link)
Recently there have been significant progress in China AI and large model space and
we expect AI to take up a more significant portion of total electricity consumption With
Doubaos (Bytedances large model) MAU (monthly active users) rising to 60mn as
of Nov 2024 according to AICPB securing the No2 spot globally and daily tokens
reaching 40 trn (announced on the 2024 Volcano Engine Force Conference on Dec 18
2024) Bytedance is set to embark on intensive AI capex investment in China (news)
Bytedances leading large model may prompt other customer service platforms (CSPs)
to also expand their capex significantly
The positive progress in model development and end applications could mark a start to
an AI capex and application era in China further boosting power demand We expect
data centers contribution to total power consumption will rise from 16% in 2023 to 5%
in 2030E with AI taking up around 12% on average within data centers
However technological advances may increase AI model training efficiency For
launched on Dec 24 2024 and is based on its self-developed Mixture of Experts (MoE)
model architecture The model increased its generation speed significantly vs its V25
from 20 TPS (transactions per second) to 60 TPS featuring 671bn parameters and was
trained in approximately two months at a cost of US558mn utilizing far fewer

1) Weaker-than-expected fiscal support and weaker-than-expected State Grid
investment in 2025E We currently expect power grid investment by the State Grid to
stay elevated in 2025E at Rmb690bn slightly higher than its announced capex plan of
Rmb650bn on Jan 15 2025 We expect possibly further raised capex or their actual
investment exceeding their announced target due to renewable energy waiting for grid
capacity If they do not raise capex target by mid-2025E like they did in 2024 or they do
expectations We also expect strong fiscal stimulus support such as the power
equipment large-scale upgrade plan Also if the financial situation of State Grid
directly impacting all Nari Techs product lines revenues
2) UHV project approval pace might fall behind its announced work plan ie under six
projects start construction in 2025 UHV project approvals and construction require
extensive coordination across multiple provinces involving agreements on land use
environmental assessments and potential delays in obtaining necessary permits could
further slow progress increasing the risk of falling behind our projected construction
starts of six lines in 2025E Fewer-than-expected UHV projects construction starts will
result in below-expectations revenue recognition for Nari Techs converter valve

Investment thesis PTRM
Nari Tech is a leading power equipment player in China holding dominant positions in
UHV converter valves grid digitalization dispatch software automation solutions and
secondary equipment such as SVCSTATCOM systems and relay protection at
34%-70% market share We are positive on Nari Tech as a structural beneficiary of the
incremental investment towards Chinas power grid modernization needs ensuring a
smarter more flexible and more reliable grid particularly as the challenges of integrating
intermittent and volatile renewable energy sources grow We believe Nari Tech can
deliver solid 10%11% revenuenet profit CAGR over 2024-30E outperforming Chinas
structurally-growing areas of grid investment ultra-high-voltage (UHV) and smart grid
dominant position in a stable market landscape and relationship with the State Grid Key
catalysts include State Grids work plans the Two Sessions in March 2025 for energy
policy direction and the release of the 15th Five-Year EnergyGrid Plan in 2026 and
strong financial profile (GPMOPM at 28%16% and a leading ROE of 18% expected in
2024-30E) and its software-heavy revenue mix (40% of total 2024E revenue) to support
a valuation premium for Nari Tech among its China industrial tech peers and hence we
are Buy-rated on Nari Tech
Price Target Risks  Methodology
Our 12-month target price of Rmb290 is based on 25X 2025E PE Key risks include 1)
Lower-than-expected fiscal support and the State Grid announcement for 2025 budget
2) UHV project approval pace falling behind its announced work plan

估值倍数（估值）和综合状况（增长、财务回报、估值倍数的综合情况）。增长、财务回报和估值倍数是运用每只股票具体指标的正常化排名计算。随后
取这些指标正常化排名的均值并转化为相关指标的百分位。每项指标的具体计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法
增长指标是基于一只股票的预期销售增速、EBITDA增速和每股盈利增速（金融股仅采用每股盈利和销售增速），较高的百分位表示公司增长较快。财务
回报是基于一只股票的预期净资产回报率、ROCE和CROCI（金融股仅采用净资产回报率），较高的百分位表示公司的财务回报较高。估值倍数基于一

在我们的全球覆盖范围中，我们使用并购框架来分析股票，综合考虑定性和定量因素（各行业和地区可能会有所不同）以计入某些公司被收购的可能性。
然后我们按照从1到3对公司进行并购评分，其中1分代表公司成为并购标的的概率较高(30%-50%)，2分代表概率为中等(15%-30%)，3分代表概率较低
(0%-15%)。对于评分为1或2的公司，我们按照研究部统一标准将并购因素体现在我们的目标价格当中。并购评分为3被认为意义不大，因此不予体现在
