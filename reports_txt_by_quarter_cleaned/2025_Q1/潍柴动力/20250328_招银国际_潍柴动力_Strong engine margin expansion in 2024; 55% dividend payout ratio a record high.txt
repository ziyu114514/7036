Weichais net profit in 2024 grew 27% YoY to RMB114bn which is in line with
our expectation Net profit in 4Q24 grew 19% YoY to RMB3bn driven by
28%13% YoY reduction of SD  RD expenses despite a flat (YoY) revenue
Weichai proposed a final dividend of RMB0347shr This together with the
interim dividend implies a payout ratio of 55% (up from 50% in 2023) which is
a record high level We revise up our 2025E26E earnings forecast by 9%11%
mainly due to higher margin assumptions for engine segment We see several
catalysts for Weichai (1) HDT demand recovery driven by new subsidies (2)
strong growth of engines for data centres (3) potential re-rating of KION Group
(KGX GR NR) Our SOTP-based TP for AH is revised up to
RMB187HK180 Maintain BUY
Key highlights in 2024 results
 Strong margin expansion for engine segment Weichai delivered a total
engine sales of 734k units (flat YoY) Exports which grew 5% accounted
for 9% of total engines sales The segment revenue was down 2% YoY to
RMB594bn due to a slight decrease in blended ASP (as a result of a 8%
sales volume decline in HDT engines which carried a higher ASP in our
view) That said the segment profit surged 35% YoY to RMB103bn driven
by a 48ppt YoY expansion of segment margin (to 175%) We forecast the
segment margin to expand to 177%178% in 2025E26E driven by the
recovery of HDT engine demand and strong growth of engines for data
 HDT exports accounted for half of total HDT sales Weichai delivered
118k units of HDTs (17% YoY) Exports grew 13% YoY to 59k units (50%
of total HDT sales) The segment recorded RMB563mn in profit in 2024
with segment margin of 09%
 Forklifts  supply chain solution (KION Group) profit grew driven by
margin The segment profit grew 21% YoY to RMB6bn in 2024 While
KIONs latest guidance for 2025E is conservative (adjusted EBIT is
expected to be down 5%-21%) we are positive on the medium-term
outlook thanks to Germanys latest approval of the infrastructure
investment plan
 Solid margin expansion for agricultural machinery While the segment
revenue growth slowed to 3% in 2H24 from 25% in 1H24 the segment
margin continued to expand
 Risk factors 1) weakness in engine exports 2) lower-than-expected
replacement demand in China (3) contraction of dieselgas price ratio
