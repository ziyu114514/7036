CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Shennan Circuit (002916 CH)
Solid FY24 results Upgrade to BUY being key
beneficiary in domestic localization
Shennan released its FY24 results Revenue went up by 324% YoY to
RMB179bn 2%7% above our estimateBBG consensus Net profit rose by
343% YoY to RMB19bn in-line with our estimate but 2% below BBG consensus
During the period GPM was 248% (vs 234% in FY23) showing gradual
improvement as demand recovered but offset by new factory ramp-up We revise
up our revenue forecasts by 15%21% for FY2526E reflecting 1) higher
utilization (90% for 1Q) 2) higher-than-expected DCAI-related revenue as
revenue growth as high-end autonomous driving systems may have faster-than-
anticipated penetration Meanwhile we revise up our NP estimates by 12%16%
in FY25-26E partially offset by lower GPM estimates considering the continuous
capacity ramp-up of Guangzhou factory with costs from equipment labor and raw
materials now recognized in COGS as production ramps up Upgrade to BUY
with new TP of RMB14681 (previous RMB115) implying a NP CAGR of 285%
and PEG of 11x during 2024-26E
 PCB sales grew by 30% YoY to RMB105bn driven by robust demand in
decline (contributing to less than 40% of total PCB sales in FY24) PCB GPM
capacity utilization and an enhanced product mix consisting of more AI-
related products PCBA segment increased by 332% YoY also driven by
robust data center and auto sales with a stable GPM of 144% We expect
the segment revenue to grow 25% YoY in 2025 driven by strong growth in
DCauto markets (domestic AI capex and higher penetration of autonomous
driving vehicles) We project GPM will be stable at current 31% level
 Substrate sales grew by 375% YoY to RMB32bn The growth weighted
more towards 1H24 as demand was strong due to inventory restocking
behaviors The segment experienced margin pressure (182% in FY24 vs
239% in FY23) due to capacity ramp-up rising material costs (specifically
gold price which surged by more than 20% in 2H24 per mgmt) and weaker
BT substrate demand in 2H24 Excluding the impact of the initial capacity
ramp-up of Guangzhou factory BT substrates GPM in 2H would have been
revenue to grow by 18% YoY in 2025E led by higher growth in memory
products as demand recovers GPM may rise modestly to 195% considering
the ongoing ramp-up dilution in our view
 Upgrade to BUY with new TP of RMB14681 The new TP is based on 5-
year avg historical forward PE of 310x We believe SCC performed better
is set to ride the tailwind of domestic localization with its leading position in
PCB market and capacity addition from its FC-BGA substrate line
(Previous TP
RMB11500)
