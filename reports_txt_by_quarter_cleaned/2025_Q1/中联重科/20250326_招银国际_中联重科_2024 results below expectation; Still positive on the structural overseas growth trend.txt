increase in inventory turnover days While we revise down our 2025E26E
earnings forecast by 7%8% after incorporating lower sales volume growth and
higher distribution expenses due to overseas expansion we remain positive
on Zoomlions structural overseas growth strategy with priorities on emerging
economies On inventory management is confident of a reduction of the
inventory level in 2025E Our TP for Zoomlion AH is revised downup to
RMB99HK74 based on 2025E target PE multiple of 195x for A-share and
30% discount for H-share We see buying opportunities following the post-
results pullback Maintain BUY

the post-results call but provided some key directions (1) overseas market
expansion will be accelerated (2) earth-working mining and agricultural
machinery will continue to be growth drivers (3) share-based expenses

We roll over our target valuation to 2025E based on 195x 2025E PE to reach our new
TP for A-share of RMB99 (previously RMB105) Our target PE is based on the five-year
average historical PE of 15x plus 1SD (previously based on 22x 2024E PE equivalent to
the peak valuation in 2021) We maintain our view that overseas expansion story will serve
as a structural driver
Our new TP for H-share (HK74 previously HK68) is based on a 30% HA discount
(previously 40%) Our narrowed target discount is to reflect the recent improvement in Hong
Kong market appetite
Major risk factors (1) further weakness of property investment in China (2) a slowdown
of overseas demand (3) increase in freight rates due to uncertain US tariff policy
