PAB reported FY19 net profit of RMB 282bn up 136% YoY and in line with its
preliminary earnings announcement Key results positives are stable NIM lower
CIR stricter NPL recognition and higher dividend payout We remain upbeat on
PABs growth prospects and see major catalysts from 1) continued better-than-
peers NIM and asset quality trend thanks to greater retail exposure 2)
successful transformation in corporate banking with support from Ping An
Group and 3) managements boost for wealth management business in order
to make up the long-standing weakness in funding cost
 Results positives 1) Loan growth accelerated to 80% in 4Q19 as
capital was replenished after the conversion of RMB 26bn CB in 3Q19
Corporate loan growth picked up to 10% QoQ driving a strong deposit
growth of 63% QoQ 2) NIM remained stable QoQ at 262% as 10bp
decline in loan yield was offset by 8bp3bp retreat in depositinterbank
indicating better operating efficiency 4) Asset quality improved with
stricter loss recognition NPL ratio edged down 3bp QoQ to 165% mainly
from 22bp contraction in corporate NPL ratio Moreover NPLs has covered
122%104% of 9060-day overdue loans implying less formation pressure
going forward 5) Retail client base continued to expand No of retail
client rose 36% QoQ to 971mn and retail AUM increased 59% QoQ to
RMB 198tn 6) Management proposed a higher dividend payout of 15%
up 5ppts from FY18

slid 64bp14bp QoQ to 91%132% on faster RWA expansion 2) Retail
NPL ratio rose 10bp HoH to 119% due to 29bp and 12bp HoH increase in
NPL ratio for credit card (166%) and auto finance loans (074%) As a
precautionary measure PAB slowed down the growth of credit card
overdraft to 58% vs 116% total loan growth in 2H19
 Maintain BUY and lower TP to RMB 1980 We trim our FY20-21 earnings
estimates by 42-75% as we lower NIM forecast by 3-5bp and raise credit
cost assumption by 8-10bp to reflect COVID-19s impact That said we
believe recent share price correction offers a good opportunity to accumulate
the stock Our revised RMB 198 TP is based on 128x target PB and
FY20E BVPS of RMB 155
