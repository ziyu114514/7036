We held an investor conference call with PAB on 20 Mar during which
management shared some color on potential impact from COVID-19 and
business outlook for FY20 There are likely near-term pressures on margin and
asset quality but the Banks successful retail transformation has laid a solid
fundamental to weather through economic cycles in our view
 Asset quality pressure more visible in 2Q-3Q20 Management expects
MSEcorporate in cyclical industries to be the key casualty of COVID-19
existing orders and cash on hand would still be able to support their loan
repayment Lack of demand and break of supply chain will amplify the
current retailcorporate loan mix of 60%40% appropriate and should help to
withstand macro uncertainties
 Retail growth target remains unchanged despite temporary slowdown
Subdued consumption activities will weigh on PABs retail loan expansion in
1Q20 but management keeps steady full-year growth target for key retail
products such as credit card and auto finance Retail business remains as
the Banks strategic focus and the quality of customers migrated from other
business channels of Ping An Group is expected to be better than that of
market peers
 NIM may narrow but should outperform peers Credit loosening and LPR
reform have been driving down banks asset yields at faster pace than
liability cost despite lower MLFreverse repo rates PABs strategy is to
shorten its liability duration such as increasing proportion of demand
deposits and lifting interbank borrowing during low-interest period
Management is confident to maintain current NIM advantage over peers
 Double 15 target stays on track Management emphasized that PAB is
still striving to achieve the Double 15 target (for both earnings growth and
ROE) set by Ping An Group Prudent impairment charges in 4Q19 and book
value dilution from CB conversion were major overhangs on current ROE
 Maintain BUY and RMB 1980 TP We keep our FY20-21E earnings
forecasts unchanged but raise NPL ratio estimates by 10bp7bp to
168%153% to reflect higher NPL formation due to COVID-19 Given PABs
largely intact long-term outlook we suggest to accumulate the stock after
recent share price dips
