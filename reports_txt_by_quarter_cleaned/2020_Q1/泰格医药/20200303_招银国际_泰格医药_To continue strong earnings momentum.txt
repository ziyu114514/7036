Strong earnings growth in 2019 Tigermed reported preliminary earnings for
2019 Attributable net profit surged 80% YoY to RMB848mn which was mainly
due to 1) 23% YoY revenue growth during the period 2) RMB250 - 350mn one-
off investment gains and disposal gains and 3) spin-off of Shengtong (晟通)
which provides logistics services in 2Q19 We estimate the organic revenue
growth in 2019E was around 28% YoY excluding impact from the spin-off We
also calculate the core net profit increased 69% YoY in 2019 We estimate gross
margin improved 50ppts to 482% in 2019 thanks to the spin-off of low margin
services We raised our earnings forecasts and raised SOTP-based TP to
RMB918 implying 52x FY21E PE
Mild near-term impact from COVID-19 outbreak The progress of clinical
trials in China were delayed due to the disease outbreak However hospitals
in most regions besides Hubei have resumed operation since late Feb We
think the process of clinical trials will catch up from Mar and the overall
impact on Tigermeds earnings will be mild and temporary
Strong demand in high-quality clinical CRO in China The number of
ongoing clinical trials in China has been increasing fast thanks to
rising focus on innovative drug development In 2019 the total phase I-IV
clinical trials in China rose 22% YoY Increasing ongoing clinical trials drives
the demand for high-quality clinical CRO services
Global expansion opens up room for long-term growth As of end-2018
Tigermed operated 11 overseas offices in Asia Pacific Europe and North
America Tigermed plans to list its subsidiary DreamCIS in KOSDAQ which
will further strengthen the Companys presence in South Korea market
With sufficient capital raised overseas we believe Tigermed will accelerate
the acquisition process in global market
We revised up our forecasts and expect Tigermeds adjusted net profit to
grow at 69%37%35% YoY in 2019E20E21E respectively and
attributable net profit to increase 80%19%31% YoY in 2019E20E21E
Tigermeds financial assets for sale reached RMB1360mn by 30 Jun 2019
which will contribute meaningful investment gains over the long term
