China Vanke-A
Contracted sales growth to stagnate
cut DPS for FY19 which disappointed investors
 We forecast a yoy decline in its contracted sales in FY20F on the back of
slower sales momentum amidst the Covid-19 outbreak in China
 We downgrade Vanke-A from Add to Hold with a lower TP of Rmb297 based
on a lower 78x FY20F PE
Decline in FY19 DPS a disappointment to investors
Although Vanke reported core net profit rose 11% yoy to Rmb39bn in FY19 the DPS
decline to Rmb1045 (from Rmb107 in FY18) disappointed investors Management
explained the decline in the payout ratio to 30% (34% in FY18) was due to prudent cash
flow management amid the Covid-19 outbreak and is confident of maintaining a stable
payout ratio in the next few years
Weak contracted sales performance ahead
Vanke reported contracted sales only rose 4% yoy to Rmb630bn in FY19 Management
estimates a shortfall in contracted sales of Rmb51bn in Feb-Mar 20 on the back of
continued Covid-19 outbreak in China In view of a delayed schedule for project launch
we revise its FY20F contracted sales to Rmb622bn (down from Rmb740bn) translating
to 1% yoy decline At end-19 it had unbooked sales of Rmb609bn leaving sufficient
room to grow its topline in FY20F-21F However we expect its gross profit margin (GPM)
for recognised sales to decline gradually on the back of higher land cost
Active landbanking in tier 1 and tier 2 cities to continue
In FY19 it acquired gross land bank GFA of 372m sq m at an average land cost of
Rmb6252sq m a 15% yoy increase as it spent 79% of its total land acquisition cost on
tier 1 and 2 cities The new land bank GFA acquired was lower than the contracted sales
GFA in FY19 (411m sq m) therefore we think it will continue to actively look for new land
bank in FY20F to avoid land bank depletion
No plans for spinning off its property management unit
Vankes property management (PM) unit reported total revenue of Rmb127bn up 30%
yoy At end-19 its PM unit had a total contracted GFA of 640m sq m (26% yoy) in
which its GFA under management amounted to 450m sq m However Vanke has no
plans for spinning off its PM unit in the near term
Downgrade from Add to Hold with a lower FY20F PE
We cut FY20F21F EPS by 7%8% to factor in a slower construction and delivery
schedule We downgrade Vanke-A from Add to Hold in view of its weaker sales and profit
growth prospects with a lower TP of Rmb297 based on a lower FY20F PE of 78x (9x
previously) which is the 5-year average 12-month forward PE A key upside risk is
stronger-than-expected contracted sales Prolonged Covid-19 outbreak and further
economic slowdown in China are key downside risks
