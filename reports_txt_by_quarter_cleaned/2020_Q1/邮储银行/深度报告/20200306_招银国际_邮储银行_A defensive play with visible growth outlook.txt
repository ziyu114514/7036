We view PSBC as an excellent defensive play amid the challenging operating
environment post COVID-19s outbreak Its extensive branch network and rich
customer resource also provide a decent growth potential Initiate coverage
 Solid funding base and asset optimization underpin a superior NIM
PSBCs unique operation model of self-managed plus agency outlets grants
easier access to cheap and stable deposit funding which accounted for 95%
of total liabilities Cost advantage has enlarged its NIM premium over Big-5
market rates appeared to weigh on PSBCs margin due to its interbank net
lender position rising LDR and higher-yield consumption-related loans bode
well for NIM outlook The Bank is a key beneficiary to potential benchmark
deposit rate cut Our analysis indicates 10bp5bp cut in timedemand deposit
rates could boost FY20E NIM and earnings by 85bp and 30% respectively
 Healthy asset quality outlook with a low-risk profile PSBC has a decent
set of asset quality indicators including NPL ratio of 083% provision
coverage of 391% and lowest SMLoverdue loan ratio in the sector The
outstanding asset quality is mainly attributed to 1) 543% proportion for retail
loans of which 615% was mortgage 2) relatively short operating history
hence little legacy NPL issue from previous rounds of credit stimulus and 3)
limited exposure to risky industries We expect PSBCs lower-than-peer NPL
formation to sustain even with the shock from COVID-19
 Extensive customer reach offers potential to enhance profitability
PSBC had total 39680 branches as of 1H19 consisting of 7945 self-
managed and 31735 agency outlets Total retail clients amounted to 589mn
(vs 627mn for ICBC) We believe its vast branch network and rich customer
resource are yet to be fully monetized Improving branch service capability
deeper customer penetration and technology utilization would be key drivers
also implies huge upside for intermediary business
 Initiate with BUY rating and RMB 730 TP We expect PSBC to deliver
150%128%156% net profit growth in FY19-21E 1-4% above consensus
estimates PSBC should enjoy a valuation premium over the Big-5 given its
higher retail exposure faster loan and earnings growth more resilient NIM
and less asset quality risk Our RMB 730 TP is based on GGM-derived
target PB of 116x and FY20E BPS of RMB 631

Investment Highlights
Solid funding base and asset optimization underpin a superior NIM
PSBCs extensive branch network enables it to easily absorb cheap and stable deposit
funding As of 1H19 deposits accounted for 951% of its total liabilities vs 783%670%
for Big-5 and JSB In particular majority of PSBCs branches are located in central and
western China where customers have weaker bargaining power and higher stickiness
lowest funding cost in the sector (156% vs 198%248% for Big-5JSB in 1H19) On
asset side loans only accounted for 452% of its total assets as of 1H19 but retail loans
contributed to 542% of total loans Hence PSBCs overall asset yield lies between that
of Big-5 and JSB
PSBCs NIM stood at 255% in 1H19 only trailed CMBs (600036 CH NR) 270% and
PABs (000001 CH BUY) 262% among nationwide banks On the back of cost
advantage the Banks NIM advantage over Big-5 peers has been more prominent amid
was mainly due to falling market rates and PSBCs balance sheet structure as an
interbank net lender That said it has trimmed interbank assets by 448% YoY as of 1H19
Continued lift in LDR and proportion of higher-yield consumption-related retail loans bode
well for the Banks NIM outlook

Given mounting economic pressure post COVID-19s outbreak and recent US rate cut
there is rising expectation for PBoC to cut benchmark deposit rate so as to create more
space for banks to reduce loan rate PSBC would be a key beneficiary to potential
deposit rate cut thanks to its high proportion of deposit funding Our sensitivity analysis
indicates 1) 10bp cut in time deposit rate could boost the Banks FY20E NIM and
earnings by 66bp and 23% and 2) 10bp cut in time deposit rate plus 5bp cut in demand
deposit rate could amplify the impact to 85bp and 30% respectively

Healthy asset quality outlook with a low-risk profile
PSBC has a decent set of asset quality indicators including 1) NPL ratio of 083% vs
sector as of 3Q19 2) stringent NPL recognition as NPL covered 124% of 90-day
overdue loans as of 1H19 3) the lowest SML and overdue loan ratio (leading indicators
for NPL) of 067% and 097% as of 1H19 and 4) solid provision coverage of 391% as of
PSBCs outstanding asset quality can be attributed to 1) higher proportion of retail loans
(543% of total loans as of 3Q19) offering greater risk diversification and lower cyclicality
to economic downturn 2) relatively late engagement in lending business thus did not get
involved in the Four trillion credit stimulus in 2009 to tackle with the global financial crisis
Loans only accounted for 464% of total assets as of 3Q19 and the remaining was
mainly bond investments and interbank assets and 3) limited credit exposure to risky
Thanks to its low-risk loan profile PSBCs NPL formation ratio has been consistently
below Big-5 and JSB Among different categories of retail loan only credit card and
personal consumption loans saw an uptick in NPL ratio in 1H19 (18bp13bp HoH to
185%132% respectively) However credit card and consumption loans only accounted
for 43% and 108% of total retail loans as of 1H19 Therefore we believe PSBCs lower-
than-peers NPL formation could sustain even with the shock from COVID-19

Extensive customer reach offers great potential to enhance profitability
bank It had a unique operational model consisting of 7945 self-managed and 31735
agency outlets totaling 39680 as of 1H19 Number of its retail clients reached 589mn
while ICBC (601398 CH BUY) had 627mn and two retail-focused JSBs CMB and PAB
had 134mn and 90mn respectively However we believe PSBCs vast branch network
and rich customer resource are yet to be fully monetized For instance number of credit
card issued was equivalent to merely 5% of its retail client base (vs 25%68%62% for
ICBCCMBPAB) and assets and profit per branch were notably below industry average
Transformation of branches increasing revenue contribution through deeper customer
penetration and technology utilization would be key factors to enhance PSBCs
profitability Specifically the Bank has been focusing on expanding agency outlets
service capability which was primarily retail deposit and intermediary businesses It
kicked off a microfinance pilot program in six provinces in Jun 2019 and planned to
extend to countrywide at later stage The Bank spent 275% of FY18 revenue on IT
investments and will raise the budget to 30%
1H19 (vs sector average of 238%) implying huge growth potential for its intermediary
We believe bank card and wealth management businesses could be major drivers ahead

Unique operational model
As of 1H19 PSBC had 39680 branches in total consisting of 7945 directly-operated
outlets and 31735 agency outlets under China Post Group In terms of geographical
distribution the Bank had 11935 branches in cities 8742 in counties and 19003 in rural
areas respectively
PSBC started retail banking by conducting micro loan business in 2007 It engaged in
credit card and personal consumption loan business in 2008 and then launched
corporate banking business in 2009 Due to its relatively younger age loans only
accounted for 464% of total assets as of 3Q19 notably lower than sector peers On the
other hand deposit contributed to 955% of total liabilities enabling the Bank to enjoy a
significant funding cost advantage PSBCs cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 156%
in 1H19 much lower than average 188% for Big-5

Expect 79%144% CAGR for revenuenet profit in FY19-21E
We forecast PSBCs revenue to grow 62%84%93% in FY19-21E mainly driven by
Loan growth will outpace overall asset growth as the Bank gradually shifts asset
allocation to loans from lower-yield bond investments and interbank assets We expect
CIR to decline as the Bank improve operating efficiency with branch transformation and
technology utilization Credit cost should soften given already stringent NPL recognition
solid provision buffer and MoFs consultation paper for banks to release excess provision
As such we estimate net profit to grow 150%128%156% in FY19-21E and ROE to
pick up to 125%132% in FY2021E
NIM to narrow but more resilient than peers
We forecast NIM to contract by 4bp2bp in FY2021E respectively due to series of LPR
funding cost rising LDR and optimized loan mix PSBCs NIM should fare better
NPL ratio is likely to rise yet still lowest in the sector
corporate and individual borrowers credit condition got worsened by COVID-19 We
expect PSBCs NPL ratio to pick up to 093%095% in FY2021E mainly from
impairment in MSE and credit card loans That said the Banks NPL ratio would remain
significantly below sector average

Risks related to macroeconomy
Chinas economic growth has been on a slowing path in recent years The outbreak of
COVID-19 increased market concerns on banks asset quality especially for MSEs
which are more susceptible to macro downturn PSBCs outstanding MSE loans
accounted for 130% of total loans as of 1H19 higher than sector peers That said the
Bank does not have to follow PBoCs guidance on targeted MSE loan growth for other
stated-owned banks Its solid provision coverage (3911% as of 3Q19) and stringent NPL
recognition (NPL to 90-day overdue loan was 1236% as of 1H19) also offer a decent
buffer against potential asset quality deterioration
Risks related to monetary policy
China banks NIM is closely related to central banks monetary policies PBoC has been
gradually driving the interest rate liberalization in China With the LPR reform started in
Aug 2019 asset pricing is now more market-oriented than liability cost thereby facing
greater downside pressure during liquidity easing Deposit funding which accounted for
95% of PSBCs total liabilities saw a more rigid cost trend than that of interbank funding
The agency fee scheme makes the Banks deposit cost less flexible than sector peers
PSBC may see less favourable NIM trend if market rates further decline but potential
repricing of the deposit agency fee would reduce the risk
Risks related to operating efficiency
As of 1H19 PSBC conducted business through 7945 directly-operated outlets and
31735 agency outlets representing 20% and 80% respectively Agency outlets only
perform deposit settlement and other agency financial services The Bank pays agency
fees for deposit taking and other intermediary businesses to China Post Group Given
than that of sector peers The Bank is trying to empower agency outlets though piloting
auxiliary microfinance business but the sustainability and effectiveness remain to be
China banks are facing multiple headwinds including economic restructuring regulatory
investing in financial technology and developing online product and service channels so
as to strengthen their ability to acquire customers PSBC had 589mn retail customers as
of 1H19 How to enhance service quality effectively retain customers and increase their
per capital profit contribution would be key challenges
