LONGi released strong earnings preview stating net profit to surge 955-1072%
to RMB50bn-RMB 53bn in FY19E The strong earnings growth implied a 4Q19
net profit of RMB 17bn marking a historical quarter high In 2020 we see wafer
supply to remain tight in 1Q20 but shifting towards oversupply implying a
potential price war in 2H20 We expect wafer ASP to decline by 110% YoY while
intense for both wafer and module sales we turn relative prudent on LONGis
share performance We downgrade LONGi to HOLD rating despite raising FY20E
EPS by 74%
 Profit reached historical high in 4Q19 Strong quarter profit implied not only
significant shipment growth but also outstanding profitability By end-4Q19
we estimate LONGis wafer capacity raised to 408GW up 457% YoY and
module capacity also increased to 16GW up 818% YoY According to mgmt
overall GPM for wafer and module would be 32% and 25% respectively in
FY19 We believe those figures would be significantly higher than peers
indicating LONGis superior costs control and operating efficiency LONGis
FY19E earnings was stronger than our estimates mainly due to 93%42%
higher than our expected wafer and module shipment respectively
 Wafer and module price under pressure Based on LONGis capacity
expansion plan we expect external wafermodule 2020 shipment will increase
605%1215% YoY to 749bn pieces and 1845GW respectively but ASP to
decline 110%172% YoY We think mono-wafer supply will still be tight in
1Q20 supporting relatively high selling price but price will likely to face
pressures as more new capacity starts production which will shift market
situation to oversupply in 2H20 We expect price cut will reduce wafermodule
GPM to 251%211% in 2020
 Wafer and module trending to larger size LONGi launched M6 wafer with
dimension of 166mm in 4Q19 in response to TJZ (002129 CH NR)s
challenge with newly developed M12 (210mm) products According to mgmt
M6 product accounted for less than 10% output and mainly used for internal
module production in 2019 In 2020 the Company expects M6 product will
account for 40% output of which 50% will be used for internal module
production At current stage M6 series product is pricing at RMB 04pcs and
RMB 5 centswatt higher than traditional M2 products sustaining LONGis
profitability over peers We expect the pricing premium will narrow as larger
size product to supply
 Downgrade to HOLD rating Based on operating and forecast update we
revise LONGis FY19-21E EPS by 196%74%-49% respectively to RMB
150162184 We turn relatively prudent to LONGis performance due to
3240 based on FY20E 20x PER
