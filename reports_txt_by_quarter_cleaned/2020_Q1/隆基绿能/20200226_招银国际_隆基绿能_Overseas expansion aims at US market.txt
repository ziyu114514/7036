LONGi announced to acquire 100% equity of Ningbo Yize which owns 3GW cell
and 7GW module capacity in Vietnam The transaction will be all cash with initial
consideration of RMB178bn with bet-on value adjustments based on FY19-21E
earnings We believe transaction valuation is less than 7x FY19 PE Considering
potential ASP boost on LONGis module sales we think the transaction is quite
Aug 2020 After consolidation we expect LONGi to seize more US module market
 Expansion speed is the key The target Company Ningbo Yize New Energy
(宁波江北宜则新能源) controls 3GW PERC cell and 7GW bifacial half-cell
module capacity in Vietnam and specialized in providing OEM services to
leading module brands in the past few years According to mgmt Ningbo Yize
has state of the art PECR cell technologies good costs structure and sufficient
order backlog to support OEM production in 2020-21 Mgmt explained
expansion speed is the most critical consideration for initiating the deal as
acquisition will save LONGi at least 18 months of construction while CAPEX
would be similar as acquisition costs
 Aiming at the US market US solar module has significant pricing premium
(82% higher vs Europe) driven by ITC step down schedule (details explained
in p2-3) Additional capacity in Vietnam will help LONGi 1) boost module sales
in the US 2) avoid trade tariff from Section 301(25%) and ADCVD(41%)
and more importantly 3) bifacial mono c-Si may be exempt from Section 201
tariff (20% in 2020) US panel shipment will significantly raise LONGis overall
module sales ASP and profitability Mgmt intends to boost US module
shipment from 11GW in 2019 to 3GW in 2020 We estimate US shipments
will increase overall module ASP by at least 58% in 2020
 Preferential payment terms with attractive valuation The transaction has
an initial valuation at RMB178bn with adjustment mechanism based on
FY19-21E earnings of RMB220241251mn respectively Ningbo Yize had
9M19 earnings of RMB248mn implying valuation less than 7x FY19E PE
With reference to benefits from US sales we believe deal valuation is
attractive and we noticed the transaction would be settled at 30%30%40%
in 2020-22 respectively bringing no financing pressures to LONGi
 Enhancing market-leading position We believe the transaction will
accelerate LONGis capacity expansion pace in downstream module sales
and further enhance the Companys profitability and leading position We raise
FY20-21E EPS estimates by 20%38% to reflect the transactions impact
and our TP is also increased to RMB3462 based on 215x FY20E PE

Pricing premium for US solar panels
US module sales has significant pricing premium
We think the pricing premium is the key reason for LONGi to initiate this surprising
acquisition According to NRELs 2Q3Q 2019 Solar Industry Update mono c-Si
module was 52% higher in price than global average The pricing premium in the
US market is partially explained by Section 201 tariff (20% from Feb 2020  Feb
2021) while the remaining can be explained by strong US PV demand urged to
qualify for the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC) According to PVinforlink mono
c-Si modules pricing premium is enlarged to 822% (US tariff incl price
US0410watt vs Europe FOB price US0225watt)

What determines the premium We think marginal supply  Based on recent
Section 201 tariff and ADCVD  Section 301 tariffs for module supplied from
China We found that US module pricing premium over average pricing in other
areas could be largely explained by additional tariff charged on Chinese module
exports According to NRELs estimates by end-3Q19 there was 11-15GW
bifacial mono c-Si capacity in Southeast Asia less than consensus US module
demand estimates of 18GW  We think marginal supply from China to the US
market would continue to support pricing premium for US solar panel sales
Figure 2 We think marginal supply price could be an explanation for US
module-pricing premium

Pricing premium would largely sustain until 2021 As US solar ITC is following
residential installation we expect US PV installation will continue to expand in
202021 Supported by the tax credit benefit US pricing premium would largely
sustain in 202021 in our view
