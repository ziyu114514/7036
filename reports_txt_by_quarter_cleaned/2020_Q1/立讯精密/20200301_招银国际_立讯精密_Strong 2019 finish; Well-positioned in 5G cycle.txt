UpDownside
Luxshare reported FY19 preliminary revenuenet profit growth of 74%73% YoY
Net profit is 24%14% above our estimatesconsensus and also beat its prior NP
growth guidance of 45-55% YoY 4Q19 revenuenet profit grew 79%72% YoY
beating consensus by 36%38% thanks to 1) strong AirPods momentum 2)
FY2021E EPS by 34%39% and raised TP to RMB554 based on 42x FY20E
PE (10% premium to peers) Luxshare is our A-share top pick given
AirpodsWatch potential and major 5G beneficiary into 2020
Strong AirPods momentum into 2020E In view of stronger-than-expected
AirPods demand and positive customer feedback we estimate AirPods
shipment to reach 100mn120mn in FY20E21E (vs 60mn in FY19) and
Luxshare will ship 65mn units in FY20E accounting for 50% of FY20E
revenue (vs 42% in FY19) In addition we believe adoption of SiP packaging
technology and continued spec upgrade (eg processor battery wireless
charging) in next-gen AirPods will boost ASP upside in FY20E21E
Riding on Apple 5G product cycles We believe Luxshare will continue to
expand into Apple supply chain in 2020E ranging from Macbook iPad to
iPhone and wearables (Watch AirPods) Luxshare is set to benefit from
iPhone 11SE2 volume growth in 1H20E and further gain share allocation
in new 5G iPhones in 2H20E leveraging strong product portfolio of antenna
acoustics haptics and wireless charging We estimate non-Airpods revenue
from Apple will account for 24%22% of revenue in FY20E21E
 Well-positioned to capture 5G opportunities Looking ahead Luxshare is
well-placed to capture growth opportunities in 5G era backed by its solid
also aggressively expanding Vietnam capacity to diversify tariff risks
 Our FY2021E NP are 21%16% above consensus Raise TP to RMB554
We revised up our FY2021E net profit by 34%29% and revenue by 35%32%
to factor in stronger AirPods shipment and ASP Hence we lifted our TP to
RMB554 based on higher 42x FY20E PE 10% premium to peers of 37x
catalysts include stronger AirPods shipment and 5G iPhone launch

Reiterate BUY and rasied TP to RMB554 (18% upside)
We derived our 12m TP of RMB554 based on 42x FY20E PE 10% premium to its peers
of 378x We believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver strong earnings growth
market share gain and product expansion to capture 5G and wireless opportunities in next
3-5 years
China 5G subs ramp Major risks include weaker AirPods demand weaker yield
improvement and slower integration of acquired businesses
