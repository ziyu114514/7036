extend the upcycle to 2020-21E  27
Zoomlion (000157 CH BUY) - Stock
ownership plan to offer strong
incentive to management  18 Nov
000300SH (rebased)
Zoomlions net profit in 2019 came in at RMB438bn up 116% Y0Y within the
profit growth range of 113-123% YoY released in the profit alert earlier That said
payout in 2018) in spite of its strong operating cash flow We believe such move
aims at protecting balance sheet and offers flexibility to buyback outstanding
bonds We fine-tuned our 2020E21E earnings forecast -5%-2% on lower
revenue assumptions Our TP is revised down to RMB685 based on 12x 2020E
PB (down from 14x) on the back of 117%-12% ROE in 2020E-22E Recovery
of construction machinery demand in 2Q will serve as key catalyst
 Key highlights on 2019 results The revenue growth in 2H19 was 50% YoY
and gross margin expanded 13ppt YoY to 30% (stable HoH) However SD
in 1H19 Besides RD expense ratio increased to 5% in 2H19 up significantly
from 27% in 2H18 and 21% in 1H19 We believe the higher expense ratio
was due to the launch of new products Thanks to lower finance expense and
effective tax rate net profit in 2H19 grew 55% YoY to RMB18bn
 Dividend cut reflects the conservative approach taken by the Company
We are surprised about the dividend cut as the Company generated strong
operating cash flow of RMB6bn in 2019 though it spent RMB21bn on share
buyback for employee share incentive scheme The latest dividend policy
suggested that the Company is potentially planning for debt repayment or
years with the first one in Dec 2022 (principal amount of US600m with
coupon rate of 613%) The recent volatile bond market due to the lack of
liquidity may offer the Company with the opportunity to buyback at discount
 Risk factors (1) Unexpected weakness on property construction activities
(2) Slow recovery of infrastructure spending (3) High earnings volatility
