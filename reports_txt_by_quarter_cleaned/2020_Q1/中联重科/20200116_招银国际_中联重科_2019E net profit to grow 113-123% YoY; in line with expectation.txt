ownership plan to offer strong
incentive to management  18 Nov
Zoomlion (000157 CH BUY) - 3Q19
net profit 106% YoY in line lots of
catalysts ahead  31 Oct 2019
SHSZ300  (rebased)
Zoomlion issued a positive profit alert saying that its net profit in 2019 is expected
to grow 113-123% YoY to RMB43-45bn The net profit range is slightly below
our estimate of RMB455bn but is largely in line with the consensus of RMB44bn
We have left our earnings forecast unchanged but we raise our TP to RMB755
from RMB728 after rolling over the valuation base to 2020E (based on 14x PB
on the back of 13% ROE in 2020E-21E) Strong industry sales data points will
likely serve as near term catalyst Reiterate BUY
 Key reasons for the earnings growth in 2019E The strong net profit growth
was driven by strong demand for both crane and concrete machinery as well
as new products such as the earth working machinery (ie excavators) and
aerial working platform (AWP) Besides oversea business also reported
continuous growth All these helped Zoomlion achieve above industry average
growth On the other hand gross margin expanded thanks to the improvement
in manufacturing efficiency product upgrade and higher sales volume Net
profit in 4Q19E grew 47% YoY to RMB107bn
spending in 1Q20E resilient property construction activities acceleration of
the replacement of NES III trucks strong delivery of large-size tower cranes
and fast-growing new products sales
 Risk factors (1) Unexpected weakness on property construction activities
(2) Slow recovery of infrastructure spending (3) High earnings volatility
