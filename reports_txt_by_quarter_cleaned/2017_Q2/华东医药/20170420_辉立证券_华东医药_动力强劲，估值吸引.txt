華東醫藥（000963 CH）公司研報
具體而言，醫藥工業業務營收585 億元，同比增長178%，毛率805%，
維持快速增長趨勢。公司核心品種百令膠囊收入突破20 億元，增速逾20%，阿
卡波糖則超過15 億元，增幅近30%，免疫抑制劑三個主要品種環孢素、嗎替麥
考酚酯、他克莫司合計營收約10 億元。
商業業務實現營收201 億元，同比增長164%，毛利率79%，維持在8%左
右，主要得益於浙江省醫藥商業行業集中度提升。還值一提的是，公司正從傳
統流通商轉向綜合健康服務供應商，子公司寧波公司在醫美和大健康領域精耕
細作，代理進口美容產品伊婉連續三年保持翻番式增長，2016 年銷售突破4 億
元，淨利潤提至149 億元，同比增長6253%。

費用方面，2016 年財務費用09 億元，同比下降12 億元，因公司定增
347 億元明顯改善財務狀況，這也是業績增速明顯快于營收增速的主要因素。
根據2017 版醫保目錄，公司3 個藥品新納入，阿卡波糖片由乙類調整為甲
類，另有他克莫司膠囊等3 個產品取消了適用症，因此，公司成為新版目錄主
百令從腫瘤輔助用藥改為氣血雙補劑，利好未來進行多科室拓展。而且，
百令膠囊市場目前主要以城區公立醫院為主，未來分級診療推進將帶動整體市
場擴大。同時，江東年產1200 噸發酵冬蟲夏草菌粉專案（一期專案）順利通過
GMP 現場核查，有效解決產能瓶頸問題。我們預期百令有望維持20%以上增速。
阿卡波糖由乙類升級為甲類，終端支付能力提升有望形成放量效應。目前
阿卡波糖市場主要以原研廠商拜耳為主，但華東醫藥及綠葉產品具備價格優
勢，不僅在招標中有競爭力，在基層覆蓋率也超過原研藥，未來進口替代效應
將進一步提升，總體預計維持30%以上增速。

此外，達托黴素、吲哚布芬等首仿或獨家品種進入醫保，未來亦將隨著招
標推進進一步放量。目前，達托黴素已在上海中標。而且，新版目錄取消了他
克莫司口服製劑和環孢素的適應症限制，還將有利於其進行多科室推廣。
目前，除了強化腎病、內分泌、免疫抑制、消化系統等專科領域外，公司
還努力拓展抗腫瘤、抗重症感染與心血管等新領域。2016 年公司共取得甲磺酸
伊馬替尼片、利奈唑胺片等13 個臨床批件，獲得了百令顆粒劑、吲哚布芬片、
地西他濱原料及製劑4 個生產批件。此外，泮立蘇粉針方面，公司還是國內首
家向美國FDA 遞交ANDA 申請並受理，並啟動了他克莫司膠囊在海外的臨床研
究。因此，公司在藥品製劑的產品梯隊還將為未來發展提供動力。
主要產品降價超預期；
兩票制落地低於預期。
