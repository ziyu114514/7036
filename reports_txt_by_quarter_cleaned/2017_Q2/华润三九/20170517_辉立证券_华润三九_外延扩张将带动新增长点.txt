華潤三九(000999CH)
華潤三九系國內OTC 領域龍頭，具備一定的品牌議價能力，未來將通過提供更豐
富的產品，進行適度的提價並提升品牌定位。同時，公司產品結構調整順利，處方藥
占比持續提升，中藥配方顆粒、血塞通軟膠囊等具有較好發展前景。憑藉強大的管道
和終端資源，公司與賽諾菲的合作還將為公司帶來新增長點，未來于大健康領域的並
購拓展亦值得期待。我們給予公司對應2017 年每股收益24 倍估值，目標價為3538
元人民幣，首予增持評級。(現價截至5 月15 日)

公司2017 年首季分別實現營收、歸母淨利潤246 元、37 億元，同比增長152、
20%，對應每股收益038 元，符合預期。
首季業績明顯好於2016 年的負增長，主要得益於聖火藥業2016 年9 月開始納入
合併報表，此外，公司配方顆粒、OTC 等原有業務穩健增長。而且，公司費用控制有
效，銷售費用率和管理費用率分別為359%和69%，相比去年分別下降06 及29 個百
分點，亦提升了業績表現。整體上，公司盈利能力維持穩定，毛率及淨率分別維持於
62%及15%左右。

華潤三九（000999 CH）公司研報
2016 年公司完成對昆明聖火藥業100%股權的收購，該公司集中於心腦血管
藥物，主要產品包括血塞通軟膠囊和黃藤素軟膠囊，與公司參附注射液注射液
等形成互補。尤值一提的是，其主要產品理洫王血塞通軟膠囊進入了2017 版
醫保目錄，未來銷售擴張有望提速。
公司還與賽諾菲簽署了在中國合作開展消費者保健業務框架協議，共
同開拓中國健康消費品市場，在中國成立一家專注於兒科及婦科非處方產品的
合資企業。同時，公司也已代理銷售賽諾菲的產品，已自1 月開始為賽諾菲全
球排名前列的護肝產品易善複做全管道代理，未來還將逐步引入其全球OTC 品
種。我們相信，賽諾菲的兒童藥品牌好娃娃、婦科藥品牌康婦特及肝臟藥
易善複將和公司的OTC 產品和管道形成良好補充，將為公司帶來新增長點。
目前國內中藥配方顆粒只占中藥飲片51，遠遠落後於亞太其他地區，再
考慮其使用範圍將拓展至二級醫院及基層醫院等，其未來發展空間廣闊。目
前，華潤三九市場份額約14%，佔據市場第二位，可生產約640 種單味配方顆
粒劑品種，具備一定的競爭優勢。公司還將以智慧化中藥房為依託，積極推廣
銷售配方顆粒，我們預期該業務將維持二成以上增速，為處方藥主要成長動力
