被低估的户外广告领跑者；上调评级至买入（摘要）
分众传媒是中国最大的户外广告运营商，市场份额占据主导地位。得益于其出众的
媒体形式、强劲的议价能力以及经营杠杆，我们认为未来三年公司能够较好地实现
十位数高端的收入增长并扩大利润率。我们调整了该股每股盈利预测及退出市盈
率，令其估值与全球同业更加一致，我们将12 个月目标价格上调至人民币1626
元（原为1348 元）。虽然股票抛售等短期风险可能不会消退，但考虑到20 倍的
2017 年预期市盈率（低于全球同业的23 倍）以及较高的利润率回报率，该股估
值具吸引力。根据29%的上行空间，将评级由中性上调至买入。
(1) 稳健的增长：由于广告收入增长稳定，我们认为分众传媒目前的广告形式比市
场所认为的更稳健，并且应能保持快速的收入增长。我们预计2017-19 年收入
EBIT 将分别年均复合增长17%22%。
(2) 在相关业务领域的潜在收购并购机会：分众传媒一直在积极探索体育、娱乐及
金融科技领域的收购和投资目标。考虑到公司现金充裕，我们认为其将继续投资相
关业务领域，从而推动盈利增长。
我们将2017-21 年预期净利润调整了6-9%，以体现受众增加推动收入利润率提高
的因素。加之我们将2021 年预期退出市盈率从原先的18 倍（参照我们的中国传
媒板块研究范围）提高到20 倍（参考全球同业估值倍数），仍使用8%的行业股
权成本贴现回2017 年，我们将12 个月目标价格上调至人民币1626 元。
潜在的解禁股票抛售，中国广告增长放缓，在影院广告方面的议价能力走弱。

PM Summary Undervalued out-of-home leader
Focus Media is the market share leader in inner-building and cinema pre-show advertising
with strong bargaining power over downstream players which supports levered earnings growth
Our outlook for a growing audience for this advertising driven by more office buildingsresidential
properties in cities and increased movie attendance make us incrementally more positive on the
margins We also increase our terminal year PE to 20X from 18X now referencing international
peers historical average (previously we referenced our China media coverage) We believe the
market is bearish about the overhang of selling pressure due to unlocking from restrictions and
consider the stock undervalued trading at a 20X 2017 PE lower than international peers at 23X
given its higher growth higher margin and stronger cash flow profile We upgrade Focus Media
to Buy from Neutral with a 12-month target price of Rmb1626 implying 29% upside among
the highest in our China media coverage
Inner-building advertising  High-value life circle media
Focus Medias revenue from LCD media and poster frame media has seen stable growth (13%
in 2014-16) broadly in line with overall advertising spending growth in China and we also expect
a 13% CAGR in 2016-21E (still in line with industry growth) driven by more office buildings and
residential properties in cities We think the reason for the stable growth is due to (1) Exposure to
a captive audience Focus Medias ad resources are usually installed in elevators which are
small enclosed spaces and are more likely to attract peoples attention (2) A growing audience
Supply of office building and residential building in large cities will not decelerate (3) Most of
believe Focus Media offers effectiveeconomically viable ways to drive a brands penetration in a
short period of time
Cinema pre-show ads A fast growing advertising media
Cinema pre-show advertising is the fastest growing segment of Focus Media The industry grew
33%40%45% in 2014-16 vs an overall ad spending CAGR in China of 18% over the same
period driven by rising movie viewership (35%52%9% yoy in 2014-16) The future driver of the
industry lies in stable growth in viewership (11% CAGR through 2020E) and higher advertising
coverage (40% of screens in China have advertising coverage in 2016 vs our expectation of 65%
in 2021E)
Focus Media has a 63% share of the cinema pre-show ad market as of 2016 ahead of the other
Medias market share will increase slightly because of its position as an independent agency able
Diversified revenue sources and strong bargaining power
In the last few years the revenue contribution from internet industry clients has increased from
16% in 2014 to 26% in 2016 thanks to the growth of the internet industry While the internet will
continue to be an important contributor we think Focus Medias revenue sources are diversified
We think the ultimate driver is growth of the advertising industry and economy In the past four
years Focus Medias share of Chinas advertising industry has been stable at about 2% We think
inner building ads and cinema ads remain two valuable advertising media and Focus Media will
continue to grow in step with the industry Focus Media has 90%70%63% market shares in inner
building LCDs  poster frames  cinema pre-show advertising as of 2016 while its downstream is
very fragmented As a result Focus Medias bargaining power is strong which leads to low cost
inflation
分众传媒 (002027SZ)
Attractive vs global peers given stronger fundamentals
We raise 2017-21E EPS by 6-9% to reflect higher revenue and higher margins driven by a
growing audience We also adjust our 2021E exit PE multiple to 20X from 18X referencing
historical-average international peer valuations and discount back to 2017E using 8% sector
COE (still in line with our China media coverage) Compared with international peers Focus
Media has higher growth higher margins and stronger cash flow and having increased
4% in line with the average of international peers Accordingly we now believe the stock merits
valuation in line with their average multiple in the long term With our estimate changes and
multiple adjustment we raise our 12-month target price to Rmb1626 from Rmb1348
historical average of 29X (26X excluding the period from November 2015 to January 2016 when
the media sector as a whole rallied) and the average for international peers of 23X

Cross check with DDM valuation
Focus Media raised its dividend payout ratio to 80% in 2016 and we believe the payout ratio is
likely to be maintained given its large cash balance We thus cross check our valuation
methodology by deriving theoretical value based on 10-year dividend discount model (DDM)
assuming the same sector COE of 8% that we use for our target price and a terminal growth rate
of 25% to reflect long term GDP growth We find that DDM yields a similar per-share value (Rmb
1659) to our current target price (Exhibit 11)

Inner-building advertising High-value life circle media
After a decade of rollout Focus Media today operates an LCD advertising network in more than
90 cities with 225000 screens and a poster frame network in more than 40 cities with 1158000
installed units Given that the ASP of inner-building media in Tier 1 cities and Tier 3 cities can
and over 50%40% of inner building media revenues are from Tier 12 cities we believe the key
driver of growth at least in the next couple of years will remain Tier 12 cities rather than
penetration into Tier 34 cities which we estimate have a much lower advertising value (ie
market revenue)
Whether its penetrating new lower-tier cities increasing more screens in higher-tier cities or
hiking ad prices once or twice every year Focus Media has been increasing its supply However
supply is not the dominating driver of growth it is demand that ultimately determines which
On the demand side a key question is whether the rise of new media such as mobile internet
could gradually replace all other traditional media Newspaper magazine and TV ads have
undergone a significant decline in ad revenue in China (-10% to 0% per year in the last three
years) while inner-building media still maintains stable growth as evidenced by a 13% revenue
CAGR in the past two years for Focus Media in this category During 2012-2016 inner-building
media segment revenue grew from Rmb51bn to Rmb78bn (78% of total 2016 revenue) The
11% CAGR over this period was broadly in line with overall ad expenditure in China during this
period suggesting stable share in the advertising market
Overall we expect revenue from inner-building advertising to grow at a 13% CAGR in 2016-
21E driven by a growing audience and superior media format This segment is an important
revenue to drive margin expansion and we raise our margin forecasts for this segment to 76-79%
for 2017-21E from 75% on average over 2014-2016
So why can inner-building media or what Focus Media refers to as life circle ad media
maintain a stable share of corporate advertising budgets and why has this media been
accelerating in the past two years We think one of the most important reasons is the high value
this format offers based on several merits
(1) Exposure to a captive audience Focus Medias display resources are highly exposed to
peoples lives Its ads are placed in locations highly visible to people entering and exiting
residential buildings and office buildings via elevators as well as people going to the cinema
Moreover office and residential building elevators in China tend to be small enclosed spaces
inconvenient for conversation apart from looking at mobile phones display screens or poster
frames inside such elevators are the only items to capture peoples attention We believe ads
displayed on such media in such locations have a higher chance of being viewed with
potential to leave a deeper impression on peoples minds
(2) Growing audience According to Cushman  Wakefield office building supply in Tier 1
National Bureau of Statistics residential building area in large cities increased about 4-5% in
2013-16 Considering about half of existing residential buildings do not have elevators and
almost all newly built residential buildings do we estimate that the area of elevator-enabled
buildings has increased more than 10% per year in the past few years We believe a growing
audience will create higher advertising value and drive revenue growth of Focus Media
buildings elevator-enabled residential buildings and cinemas and thus are exposed to
分众传媒 (002027SZ)
are of higher value and more attractive to advertisers
(4) Lower price than TV ads and online ad streaming According to CTR Market Research
Focus Medias CPM (cost per mille impressions) in multiple cities is lower than the CPM of
local television stations and also cheaper than online ad streaming making it more
economical to advertise on Focus Media
(5) Highly effective way of building new brands Given the above we believe Focus
Medias display resources are the most effective way to make a brand popular all over China
in a short space of time According to WPPs BrandZ 2016 report on the top 100 most
valuable Chinese brands in the last two years 81% of the top 100 brands in China have
placed their ads on Focus Medias network suggesting the high value of Focus Medias

Cinema pre-show ads A fast growing advertising media
Increased market penetration key
Cinema advertising is the fastest growing segment of Focus Media with revenue up
65%42%51% yoy in 2014-16 and on our estimates set to grow a further 22% over 2016-2021E
In cinema advertising Focus Media rents pre-show time slots from cinema operators and sell the
network effect backed by its leading market share in cinema advertising and broad client
base As of 2016 Focus Media covers more than 1500 cinemas and 10000 screens
accounting for 24% of total screens in China (up from 21% in 2015) In the future Focus Media
plans to further increase its screen coverage by penetrating into lower tier cities and signing more
partners We expect its screen penetration will increase to 40% in 2021E from 24% as of 2016
Moreover we expect stable margins on leading market share and relatively strong bargaining
Pre-show cinema ads are one of the fastest growing ad segments in China as a whole with
revenue rising 33%40%45% in 2014-16 versus the total advertising market in China growing at
about a 17% CAGR over the same period The rapid growth of the cinema advertising industry is
driven by rising movie viewership (35%52%9% yoy in 2014-16) thanks to the booming movie
market in China The captive nature of cinema advertising also underlies the high value of cinema
ads in our view
The future driver of the industry lies in the stable growth of Chinas movie industry and viewership
the latter of which we forecast to grow at an 11% CAGR through 2020 Another driver is higher
advertising coverage As of 2016 only 40% of screens in China have advertising coverage and
most of them are in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities However we expect the coverage to increase to 65%
by 2021E thanks to major players increasing their screen penetration
In the US growth of pre-show ads is also in line with movie box office growth In 2016 the pre-
show ad market size was about 7% of box office revenue up from 6% in 2012 As noted by the
Cinema Advertising Council (CAC) in its 2016 report the high value of cinema ads resides in the
high ratio of millennial moviegoers which is considered valuable to advertisers

Competitive landscape Consolidated but still intense
The market structure of cinema pre-show ads is somewhat consolidated Focus Media is the
largest player with a 63% market share in 2016 Wanda Media a subsidiary of Wanda Film
(002739SZ) is the second largest player and the third player Jingmao is a subsidiary of
Changyou (CYOU Coverage Suspended)
Wanda Media covers pre-show ads of all cinemas operated by Wanda Film As Wanda Film will
grow its self-owned cinemas very quickly (32%21% in 201718E according to our estimate) and
will also have cinemas from CJ CGV and Bona Cinema joining its network we expect the
resource growth of Wanda Media to be very rapid Moreover China Film (600977SS Not

Rising revenue contribution from the internet  a blessing or a concern
In the last few years the revenue contribution from internet industry clients has increased from
16% in 2014 to 26% in 2016 thanks to the growth of the internet industry We note some
concerns over this mix change some worry that fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and autos

and 63% in cinema pre-show ads as of 2016 However its downstream is very fragmented In
operate locally with no nationwide players In cinemas Focus Medias downstream customers
account for about 37% of market share (Exhibit 27)
As a result Focus Medias bargaining power is strong which leads to low cost inflation In 2016
media rental costs for inner building media increased 11% yoy while revenue increased 13% yoy
and the gross margin of inner building media increased 05 ppt The gross margin of cinema ads
also increased from 59% in 2014 to 62% in 2015 although it dropped to 61% in 2016 due to

Bargaining power weakening in cinema advertising
fragmented but there are a few large players like Dadi Cinema and Jinyi Cinema The industry
might further consolidate weakening Focus Medias bargaining power and posing an upside risk
to rent expenses
Advertising dollar shifting online
In the past three years online advertising has been growing very fast (30-40% in 2014-16)
especially mobile internet Even though mobile penetration is already high there is still risk that
advertisers will shift their dollar from traditional media (including out-of-home) to online given that
online media offers a more targeted advertising service
Pitfalls in diversification
seeking to better monetize its user traffic and create new sources of revenue However its
