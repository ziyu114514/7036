Executive Summary Strong fundamentals priced in Neutral
Hikvision has grown and consolidated its position as a global surveillance industry leader over the
past decade with its focus on RD growing scale advantage and leveraging its SOE
background effectively to win projects from public sector clients We believe this has also been
underpinned by the last two waves of technology upgrades from (1) analog camera to IP camera
and (2) isolated network structure to connected network structure
Looking forward we expect the next wave of upgrades to AI-embedded surveillance products
and systems to further expand Hikvisions market share and raisestabilize its gross margin
Hikvision has been the leader in introducing AI surveillance products into the market since
2015 from cameras to network video recorder (NVR) to servers For example its products
have been adopted by Nanchang Citys SkyNet project effectively improving the accuracy
and speed of identifying potential suspects and security breaches
to relevant data sets from its large customer base Our global AI report (Artificial Intelligence
AI Machine Learning and Data Fuel the Future of Productivity dated Nov 14 2016) identifies
four key inputs for profit pool creation as we move towards an AI-centric world data talent
infrastructure and silicon and ranks large differentiated data sets as the most likely driver of
Valuations fair initiate with Neutral
We initiate on Hikvision with Neutral and a 12-month target price of RMB410 implying 5%
potential upside We apply 20X industry average PE multiple to Hikvisions 2018E EPS to arrive
at our target price 20X is the average PE multiple of Hikvisions global and domestic peers in
2018E All the stocks included have above US1bn market cap
We rate Hikvision Neutral on valuation grounds Post a 62% rally in its stock price ytd the
stock is now trading around its 12-month historical average PE multiple of 19X and in line with
its global peers Key risks to our view and target price include fluctuations in governmentpublic
Competitive edge Scale advantage and SOE background
Being the largest surveillance provider in the world Hikvision has scale advantage in terms of
its (1) sales force and distribution network (2) RD team and spending (3) economies of scale
in SGA (4) pricing power with its suppliers and (5) data sets These scale advantages reflect in
its above-average gross margin and industry leading net margin among Chinese surveillance
aspect of interpretation  data  which is critical for training deep learning algorithms in our view
Leveraging its SOE background and relationship with the public sector (ie public security
transportation judicial etc) we believe Hikvision is in a strong position to provide surveillance
solutions to these customers Public security (ie police force) and transportation segments have
the strongest incentive to adopt state-of-the-art surveillance solutions in our view
Earnings growth to catch up with revenue growth by 2020E
We expect Hikvisions revenue to reach RMB83231mn in 2020E at a CAGR of 27% from
2016 Front-end products will still be a big driver for this growth with incremental as well as
upgradereplacement demand for cameras On the other hand we see control center
equipments share of revenue to increase from 12% in 2016 to 29% in 2020E as we believe

in the AI era with growing focus on big data and intelligent analysis of these data sets the
We expect Hikvisions EPS to reach RMB314 in 2020E at a CAGR of 27% same as the
revenue CAGR The surveillance industry has been going through consolidation with big
players such as Hikvision gaining market share on a consistent basis In 2016 Hikvisions
gross margin improved for the first time over the past seven years and net margin stabilized
after three years of decline Going forward we expect its gross margin to stabilizeimprove
leading to earnings growth catching up with revenue growth

sustain its profitability going forward in our view together with managements focus on
In 2016 Hikvision had over RMB100mn in revenue from its AI products which according to
management was above their expectations These products are generally sold for more than
RMB10000 a piece and gross margins are at least 10% higher than other products Going

Fluctuation in governmentpublic spending
As government and public-related projects accounted for over 40% of total domestic demand
in 2016 we see fluctuation risks if there are any policy changes at the central government
level and spending delays at local government level
For example during 2015-2016 demand in government related projects slowed due to
slowing macro economic growth in China This led to Hikvisions revenue growth slowing
down to 47% yoy and 26% yoy in 2015 and 2016 from 60% yoy in 2014 Starting 2H16
industry participants have noted a recovery in demand and this could pose an upside risk to
our forecasts
Competitive intensity
There are over 1500 surveillance product providers in China Although Hikvisions size is
relatively low-end standardized distribution channels
ASP for mature surveillance products generally declines at a rate of 6%-7% yoy However in
periods of weaker demand surveillance product providers tend to cut pricing more
aggressively in order to protect market share and maintain revenue growth On the other
hand products with technology leadership and limited supply tend to have a high pricing
premium initially
Scale and SOE background set Hikvision apart
initially able to leverage its SOE background and public sector relationships to supply into high-
demand sectors such as police and transportation Then with its productservice experience and
expertise it expanded into enterprise sectors such as financials property and energy In overseas
and later entered into solutions service
Hikvision could leverage its scale advantage to provide advanced high-quality products and
services and continue to gain market share worldwide As we advance into the AI era scale
advantage has gained an incremental aspect of interpretation  data  which is paramount for
training deep learning algorithms
Our global AI report (Artificial Intelligence AI Machine Learning and Data Fuel the Future of
Productivity dated Nov 14 2016) identifies four key inputs for profit pool creation as we move
towards an AI-centric world data talent infrastructure and silicon and ranks large
differentiated data sets as the most likely driver of growth Hikvisions large customer base
gives it a headstart vs peers on the AI front in our view
Being the largest surveillance provider in the world Hikvision has scale advantage in terms of its
sales force and distribution network RD team and spending economies of scale in SGA and
pricing power with its suppliers
Hikvision is the worlds largest video surveillance provider with about 10% global market share in
2016 It has 35 officesbranches throughout China and 28 offices around the world Leveraging

As of end 2016 Hikvision had 20013 employees in total and 4061 (20%) of these were
from sales There are in total 661 cities in China as of 2016 which means on an
average Hikvision has over 6 sales people in every city Hikvisions in-house sales force
is 19X that of Dahua the number two surveillance provider in China (No 4 globally
according to Asmag) and over 10 times that of Uniview the number three surveillance
provider in China (No8 globally according to IHS)
In addition to its internal sales force Hikvision has over 10000 distributors throughout the
country or 15 per city on average These deep coveragechannels give Hikvision more
which in turn translates into RD and productservice improvement Over the past ten years
Hikvision grew its sales force from 707 in 2009 to 4061 in 2016 (28% CAGR) going forward
we expect this trend to continue as it expands global presence
In the overseas market Hikvison has 25 overseas subsidiaries sales in 150 countries and
regions and partnership with 140 distribution partners as of 2016 During the past year

5 Data sets  critical for AI
Our global AI report (Artificial Intelligence AI Machine Learning and Data Fuel the Future of
Productivity dated Nov 14 2016) identifies four key inputs for profit pool creation as we move
towards an AI-centric world data talent infrastructure and silicon and ranks large
surveillance industry Hikvision has an industry leading customer base across seven
broad sectors public security transportation civil judicial financial energy and building With
using Nvidia GPUs We note that the more data a training algorithm learns the more intelligent it
and former Chief Scientist at Baidu  puts it Deep learning is (almost) always about scale
Hikvision was established in 2001 by the No52 Research Institute of China Electronics
Technology Group Corporation (CETC) which is under the State-owned Assets Supervision and
Administration Commission (SASAC) CETC is mainly involved in the research development and
Leveraging its SOE background and relationship with the public sector (ie public security
transportation judicial etc) Hikvision is in a strong position to provide surveillance solutions to
these customers in our view We believe the public security (ie police force) and transportation
segments have the strongest incentive to adopt state-of-the-art surveillance solutions as the
efficiently and effectively and helping the transportation department identify vehicles breaking the
law and issue fines As a result these government-related projects focus more on technology and

Core drivers of revenueearnings growth
Front-end products
As of 2016 50% of Hikvisions revenues was from front-end products ie cameras access cards
the biggest revenue driver for Hikvision growing at a CAGR of 126% (2007-2016) and overtaking
back-end products as the largest revenue contributor in 2012 Along with technology upgrade
from analog to digital and now to AI cameras Hikvision expanded its market share and
consolidated its dominance supported by high quality products and time-to-market advantage
Front-end AI products In 2016 Hikvision launched DeepInview camera series based on
recognition and analysis It is the first and only AI-enabled front-end product in the market
Hikvision also launched Super Defog Darkfighter and DarkfighterX3 camera series in 2016
leading the industry in terms of capturing clearer cleaner and brighter color images in foggy
starlight and darker environments Going forward we expect front-end products to continue to be
a big revenue contributor and grow at a CAGR of 18% over 2016-2019E

Back-end products
Revenue from back-end products grew 19% yoy in 2016 and accounted for 16% of Hikvisions
total revenue these include storage products such as XVR (Hybrid Video Recorder) NVR
(Network Video Recorder) CVR (Central Storage Video Recorder) cloud storage system
products SD memory card and SSD (Solid State Disk) as well as some transmission products
such as video encoders video decoders video optical transceivers network optical transceivers
and network switches Revenue growth for back-end products has been relatively slower than
front-end products partly due to the small base of the latter in the earlier years and partly due to
relatively longer depreciable life of back-end products in our view

From 2008 to 2016 Hikvision grew its EPS by 12X from RMB010 to RMB122 or a CAGR of
36% We notice that EPS growth lagged Hikvisions revenue growth mainly as a result of
declining gross margins from 51% to 42% The gross margin pressure was from (1) market
reach RMB314 at a CAGR of 29% same as the revenue CAGR The surveillance industry
has been going through consolidation with big players such as Hikvision gaining market

Introducing MA framework for Hikvision
In our report Navigating the noise (6) Introduce MA framework update roadmap dated July 4
2016) we examined stocks in our Asia Pacific technology coverage using our MA framework —
considering impediments that could prevent a transaction from occurring as well as qualitative
at a premium to current share prices
1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of MA activity 2 representing medium (15%-30%)
probability 3 representing low (10%-15%) probability and 4 representing minimal to no probability
Firstly we look at whether there are any impediments such as shareholder
structurepreferences industry regulationsgovernment policies and takeover defense that
could prevent a transaction from occurring We then consider four qualitative factors including
1) attractiveness of technology 2) attractiveness of customers 3) cost synergy potential 4)
otherintangible value and two quantitative factors 1) market cap and 2) valuations
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
When assessing potential impediments we take into consideration
(1) major shareholder preferences (we assume that shareholders with a 20% or greater stake
have significant influence or a blocking stake) and take into account any potential actions by
major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third party (including whether they
would likely be receptive or if they may be opposed to selling) or if they have announced a
(2) regulatory and or government policy impediments and
(3) possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill
We assign a No qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are applicable and
a Yes qualification if these considerations do not apply
Four qualitative assessment criteria
generating future value as well as its technological capabilities and intellectual property rights
We assign a rank of 4 if its technology is unattractive 3 if it is moderately attractive 2 if it is
attractive and 1 if it is very attractive
product applications We also take customer retention and end-market exposure (including sales
channels) into account We assign a rank of 4 if its customer base and product applications are
unattractive 3 if they are moderately attractive 2 if they are attractive and 1 if they are very
attractive
3) Cost synergies We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for profit
there is low possibility of synergies 3 if there is some possibility  2 if there is high possibility
and 1 if there is very high possibility

its valuation is significantly discounted We take into account differing valuation multiple ranges
Within this framework we assign an MA rank of 3 to Hikvision
This is mainly due to its relatively large market cap of US33983mn SOE background and

AI improving analysis speed and accuracy significantly
Hikvisions Falcon AI server is capable of creating structured data of vehicles and suspects in the
event of a security breach ie labeling of the image by vehicle type vehicle brand license plate
color of clothes etc Falcon also helps in searching for images of the alleged suspects over a
period of time around a particular area
We note that public sector clients could benefit from Hikvisions technology with improved speed
and accuracy of data analysis For example in a recent event of a security breach Hikvision
stated that Falcon cut down the time for data analysis significantly (ie to a few seconds
could have otherwise taken days to analyze) Previously facial recognition accuracy was 100-200
out of 1000 people now with deep learning the accuracy rate has improved to 10 out of 1000
people according to Hikvision
