老窖重焕生机，上调评级至买入（摘要）
我们认为泸州老窖（在中国拥有市场份额排名第三的高端品牌 ）将受益于高端白
酒市场的强劲复苏。此外，我们认为公司于2015 年实施的改革在经历了2015-16
年的稳定调整期后开始收效。我们将2017-21 年预测上调了至多19%，以体现下
列因素：(1) 高端及中端产品强劲反弹，原因在于渠道改革令公司重振品牌实力；
(2) 产品结构升级带来利润率扩张。基于我们新的12 个月目标价格人民币5506 元
存在10%的上行空间，我们将泸州老窖评级由中性上调至买入。
泸州老窖的高端品牌——国窖1573 的一批价上涨。目前国窖1573 的一批价
为每瓶人民币680 元，进一步接近出厂价，我们估测公司为经销商提供约
10%的销售返点。考虑到2017 年下半年贵州茅台供需格局将比较紧张，而且
五粮液一批价上涨，国窖1573 的一批价也有可能上涨。如果公司减少销售返
点，那么我们预计销售费用将会下降，从而提振盈利。
泸州老窖的母公司允许其实施国企改革、股权激励计划以及兼并收购。我们认
为潜在的国企改革可能对公司有利，因为管理层和公司的利益将更好地结合起
我们认为当前估值具吸引力，该股股价对应27 倍的2017 年预期市盈率，而2016-
18 年预期每股盈利的年均复合增速为31%（该板块对应26 倍的2017 年市盈率，
而2016-18 年预期每股盈利的年均复合增速为23%）。我们的12 个月目标价格为
人民币5506 元（原为4617 元），仍基于20 倍的市盈率乘以2021 年每股盈利
预测，并以87%的行业股权成本贴现回2017 年。
高端中端产品收入的复苏不及预期；消费税率提高。

Rising from the trough
Luzhou Laojiao is one of the oldest spirit brands in China dating back to the Ming Dynasty It was
challenging time during 2013-14 when its revenue declined 54% from Rmb115bn in 2012 to
Rmb535bn in 2014 while net profit declined 80% from Rmb439bn in 2012 to Rmb880mn in
2014 Although the sector corrected due to the governments anti-corruption measures the
gradually recovered in 2015-16 with revenuenet profit back to Rmb83bn1928bn in 2016 closer
to the historical peak in 2011 With momentum building up and reform continuing to take effect
the new management has set a new target of getting back to the industry top 3 before 2020 and
has started to accelerate revenue growth in 2017 after the stabilizingadjustment period during
Well positioned amid a high-end spirit upcycle
brand by market share Kweichow Moutai continues to have limited supply and rising prices
which should benefit followers such as Wuliangye and Guojiao 1573 (owned by Luzhou laojiao)
We expect faster revenue growth with the new management continuing to focus on 5 super
brands (Guojiao 1573 Jiaoling Tequ Touqu  Erqu) sales channel expansion and bolstering
price We raise our 2017-21E estimates by up to 19% to reflect
(1) a strong rebound in high-end and mid-end products with channel reform reviving Laojiaos
brand strength (23%22% revenue CAGR in 2016-21E for high-end  mid-end by our estimate)
(2) product mix shift upgrade leading to margin expansion We expect faster growth of high-end
and mid-end products to bring c1ppt margin expansion annually
Valuation attractive strong catalysts
Our 12-month target price of Rmb5506 (was 4617) is still based on 20X PE applied to 2021E
EPS and discounted back to 2017E using 87% sector COE We consider current valuation
attractive with the stock trading at 27X 2017E PE with 31% 16-18E EPS CAGR (vs sector at 26X
2017E PE with 23% 16-18E EPS CAGR) We see the following two catalysts
(1) Rising wholesale price of Guojiao 1573 Laojiaos high-end brand Current wholesale price of
gives about 10% rebate to distributors Given Moutai will be in a tight balance in 2H17 and
Wuliangyes wholesale price is rising Guojiao 1573 might follow suit We expect sales expenses
MA We think potential mixed ownership reform could benefit Laojiao with management interest
Lower-than-expected recovery of high-end  mid-end revenue Our thesis hinges upon a
recovery of high-end and mid-end spirit segments if that falls below expectation it could be a
Consumption tax rate hike Laojiaos consumption tax rate was only 10% in 2016 lower than
泸州老窖 (000568SZ)
Strong recovery aided by reforms
Reform measures taking effect
Because of some strategic mistakes in pricing and marketing Laojiaos revenues declined
In June 2015 Luzhou Laojiao appointed its new Chairman Miao Liu and new President Feng
Reform measures launched by the new management include  Super Brand strategy to focus on
five key brands tightening supply to bolster price and channel reforms
Before 2015 Luzhou Laojiao had about 3000 SKUs including many licensed brands
Manufacturers of these licensed brands produced and marketed on their own and then attached
to a Luzhou Laojiao brand package Hence brand management was chaotic and different
brands cannibalized each other The Super Brand strategy aimed to cut the number of brands
and identified five key brands to focus on Guojiao 1573 as a high-end brand Jiaoling and Tequ
as mid-end brands and Touqu  Erqu as low-end brands
Exhibit 1 Five key brands in the Super Brand strategy
brands with ex-factory price below Rmb20 and stopped providing packages with Luzhou Laojiao
from 3000 to about 400-500
licensed manufacturers have to purchase spirit from Luzhou Laojiao Luzhou Laojiao will monitor
and manage their manufacture process and all products have to be detected at designated
detecting platforms
We think these reforms will help Luzhou Laojiao effectively manage its brands First quality of

Tightening supply to bolster price
suspended supply of Guojiao 1573 to clear channel inventory and bolster price In Sep 2016 the
actual needs Supply is tightened to ensure price stability In Mar 2017 ex-factory price of
Guojiao 1573 was raised from Rmb620 to Rmb680
We think these supply tightening measures that came after revenue growth rebounded from
helpful in protecting brand image and supporting long-term development

Channel reform Shifting to brand operating model

The new management of Luzhou Laojiao decided that this channel model is not consistent with its
Super Brand strategy and is gradually shifting to a brand operating model In the new model

Guojiao 1573 the flagship brand of Luzhou Laojiao
Guojiao 1573 is the high-end brand of Luzhou Laojiao Jiao refers to a cellar where spirits
ferment While western liquor ferments in oak barrels Chinese spirit ferments in cellars The more
were built in year 1573 at the time of the Ming dynasty Guo means national and refers to the
above mentioned cellars being awarded as the first cellar in China by the industry in 1996 The
first batch of Guojiao 1573 products were launched in 2001
Guojiao 1573 is one of the few players in the high-end spirit market in China In 2011 its retail
price was even Rmb250 higher than Wuliangye However during the industry down cycle in
201314 management hiked ex-factory price by Rmb110bottle in Aug 2013 while Moutai and
Wuliangye maintained their ex-factory prices This resulted in sales volume of Guojiao 1573
2014 by Rmb319bottle and by a further Rmb130bottle in Aug 2014 to Rmb560bottle Guojiao
1573s market share dropped from 7% in 2012 to 2% in 2014
However the price cut didnt diminish the quality of the spirit With the recovery of the high-end
spirit market from late 2015 prices of Moutai and Wuliangye have been increasing making
Guojiao 1573 more attractive In 2015 and 2016 revenue of Guojiao 1573 increased 72%  89%
yoy showing strong demand and consumer faith in the quality and branding of Guojiao 1573
Because the cellars used to produce Guojiao 1573 cannot be replicated in a short time
production capacity of Guojiao 1573 is limited to about 3000 tons of base spirit and 5000-6000
tons of end product much less than Moutai (40k tons) and Wuliangye (16k tons) and
demonstrates the scarcity of Guojiao 1573 In 2016 Guojiao 1573s market share in high-end
spirit was 46% We expect it to increase to 5% in 2017 driven by the strong rebound in volumes
which might surpass the peak volume in 2011
brand in terms of market share Kweichow Moutai continuing to have limited supply and raising
prices benefiting lower-tier brands such as Wuliangye and Guojiao 1573 (owned by Luzhou
laojiao) With reform effect continuing to manifest we think Laojiaos sales volume might further
double to over 6000 tons in the next five years representing 19% CAGR during 2016-21E In
terms of pricing the ex-factory price hike in Mar 2017 will likely bring c 6%5% ASP rise in
201718 Apart from this we have not factored in further price hikes and expect ASP to be largely
stable in the next couple of years As a result we forecast robust revenue growth in the next five
years for Guojiao 1573 (23% CAGR in 2016-21E) and moderate GP margin expansion on the
back of product mix upgrade

Jiaoling  Tequ super brands to tap the mid-end market
Among the different price segments of the spirit market we think the mid-end market has the
most upside potential in the next five years mainly driven by consumption upgrade of the mass
population from low-end to mid-end We think Jiaoling  Tequ with a price range of Rmb150-400
are powerful brands to tap the promising mid-end spirit market

Jiaoling Product mix shifting up
The Jiaoling series has three products aged 306090 years with retail price of about
advocate for Jiaoling products These well-known and respected hosts helped shape Jiaoling
spirits brand image as a spirit for smart and experienced business people
Currently Jiaoling 30 years still contributes to majority of sales but the product mix has started to
shift towards the higher end In 1H16 30 years Jiaoling accounted for 59% of sales down from
80% in 2015 Going forward management hopes to further increase the contribution of 60 and 90
years so as to differentiate Jiaoling from Tequ which sells at about Rmb170
brand resources The number of salespeople has increased to about 800 from 200 in 2015 which
we believe ensures better control over marketing effectiveness and channel penetration
We estimate the ex-factory price of Jiaoling kept rising in 2015 and 2016 thanks to product mix
shift and managements measures to tighten supply and clear channel inventory In future we
expect further ASP increase due to product mix change and 20% volume CAGR in 2016-21E

Tequ Super brand targeting to reach Rmb10bn of sales in 10 years
Market pricing of Tequ used to be chaotic and in some areas the product sold at very low prices
supply of Tequ in Jan 2016 Thanks to tightened supply and price hike price of Tequ has restored
to its previous height in 2013 according to our estimate
Tequ is positioned to tap the mid-end business and private entertainment demand Management
lays strategic importance on Tequ and hopes to develop it into a super brand with Rmb10bn in
sales in 10 years (from about Rmb12bn in 2016)
We estimate steady revenue growth for Tequ in the next five years driven by a volume CAGR of

Luzhou Laojiao established Boda Company in 2008 to be responsible for low-end products Its
key products include Touqu and Erqu As a relatively independent operating subsidiary Boda
Company developed rapidly until 2013 but slowed down in recent years due to the overall
slowdown in the spirit industry Echoing Luzhou Laojiaos new Super Brand strategy Boda
Company has made a series of reforms
reduce these peripheral SKUs and focus more on core Super Brands like Touqu and Erqu
(2) Brand positioning to tap different needs Going forward Boda Company aims to have a
clearer brand positioning for its core brands For example Jingpin Touqu would focus on
business consumption Lao Touqu would focus on family feast and Erqu would position itself as a
fast-moving consumer brand We think the clear positioning of brands would minimize brand
cannibalization and is consistent with the overall Super Brand strategy of Luzhou Laojiao
(3) Focus on county level channels In Luzhou Laojiaos product positioning Touqu is
positioned as a county spirit and Erqu positioned as village spirit In order to better penetrate
county and village level channels Boda Company has strengthened its sales team and now has
better control over distributors and terminals
(4) Active marketing For low-end mass market products its very hard to raise price
significantly Hence volume increase is the most important driver However given spirit is already
well penetrated and we dont see overall consumption volume increasing much in future years
Boda Company has intensified marketing efforts including recruiting more salespeople having
tighter control over distributors and achieving greater influence on consumers
Currently the mid-to-low end market is still very fragmented Luzhou Laojiaos mid-end plus low-
products with strong branding are more likely to stand out which gives Luzhou Laojiaos low end
products a better position
In 2016 Luzhou Laojiaos revenue from low-end products declined 31% mainly because of
while ASP will likely remain stable

Earnings estimates and valuation
We raise our 2017-21E estimates by 2-19% to reflect higher volumes on both mid-end and high-
end brands and margin expansion driven by product mix upgrade Our 12-month TP of Rmb5506
(was 4617) is still based on 20X PE applied to 2021E EPS and discounted back to 2017E using
87% sector COE
Our current estimate do not factor in any further price hikes after the recent 10% hike of Guojiao
1573 in March 2017 However with the rising price of peers such as Wuliangye we think a price
hike might be possible in 2018 We thus conduct a scenario analysis on a potential price hike
situation Our analysis suggests that a price hike could be a strong value driver A 10% price hike
for its mid-end and high-end brands in 2018 would drive net profitvaluation 20%19% higher
according to our sensitivity analysis
