26 June 2017
16 年全年多賺一成
上海機場16 年實現營業收入6951 億元，同比增長106%，歸屬上淨利潤2806 億
元，同比增長108%；每股收益146 元，同比增長1145%。每股派息044 元人民幣，
派息率30%。業績低於我們預期4%左右，主要原因有兩方面：
一， 上海機場航空流量自下半年起受到限制增速放緩，航空性業務收入低於預期。全
年航空性業務收入同比增長99%至351 億元，非航業務收入同比增113%至344
二， 期內運營及租賃費用大幅增加183 億，T1 航站樓改造工程轉入固定資產，折舊費
用增加043 億，人工費用增加15 億。最終運營成本同比增加123%，快於收入
增速，毛利率下降08 個百分點至451%。
2016 年公司的飛機起降4799 萬架次，同比增長71%，旅客吞吐量6600 萬人次，同
比增長99%，貨郵吞吐量34403 萬噸，同比增長51%。由於准點率未達標，民航局
自去年年中起暫停了上海浦東機場客運加班、包機和新增航線航班業務申請，公司去
年下半年飛機起降架次的同比增速相較上半年放慢了接近2 個百分點。分市場看，國
際市場的客運量及貨運量均好於國內市場。
17 年首季業績大增超兩成
2017 年一季度上海機場營業收入同比增長1577%至1895 億元，實現歸屬淨利潤791
億元，同比增長2346%；基本每股收益041 元，同比增長2424%。毛利率同比提升
23 個百分點至454%。一季度，公司的飛機起降架次，旅客吞吐量，或有吞吐量分別
同比增長34%，76%和13%。分市場看，國際航線的貨運好於國內航線，國內航線的
客運好運國際航線。在時刻受限情況下，貨郵吞吐量增速的反彈和T1 改造完成後商業
面積擴大所帶來的非航業務業務較快增長是一季度業績超預期的主要原因。
商業三大利好有望提振業績空間
公司目前的高峰小時航班數為76 架小時，產能利用率僅為84%，遠低於可比同行。
隨著第五跑道、S1S2 衛星廳的完工，旅客吞吐能力將達到8000 萬人次以上，為公司
業務量的持續提升提供了保障。而機場收費改革，免稅招標將為公司業績提供更大的
公司財務狀況十分穩固，資產負債率僅為16%。現金流充沛，在手現金近百億元，每
年的經營性現金淨流入接近30 億，足以覆蓋資本開支，預計派息率將持續穩定。
我們預計公司20172018 年的每股EBITDA 將分別至209，253 元人民幣，我們給予各
約1916 倍估值倍數，提高目標價為人民幣4048 元，給予增持評級。(現價截至6
