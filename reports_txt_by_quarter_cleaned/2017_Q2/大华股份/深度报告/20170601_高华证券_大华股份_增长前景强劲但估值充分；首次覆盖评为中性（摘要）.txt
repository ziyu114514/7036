大华股份 (002236SZ)
增长前景强劲但估值充分；首次覆盖评为中性 (摘要)
我们认为大华将继续在整合之中的安防行业赢得市场份额。截至2016 年，大华
股份是国内第二大、全球第四大视频监控设备及解决方案供应商。我们还预计
随着竞争趋于理性，小企业利润率下降，公司的毛利率将有所改善，且转型后
解决方案业务在收入中的占比将上升。我们预计2016-19 年公司收入年均复合
增速将为32%，盈利年均复合增速将为24%，得益于公司对营销网络和研发实
力的持续投入。然而，鉴于我们的12 个月目标价格为人民币1900 元，仅意味
着4%的上行空间，我们首次覆盖该股给予中性评级。
(1) 海外：未来三年，我们预计海外市场的收入对大华增长的贡献将占三分之
二，在总收入中的占比将从2016 年的38%升至50%。大华已经从一家
OEMODM 企业转型为拥有自主品牌的解决方案供应商。(2) 解决方案：在经过
两年从侧重于分销渠道的产品供应商向整体解决方案服务提供商的转型后，
2016 年大华股份的解决方案业务收入在其国内市场占到50%左右的份额，并向
海外市场挺进。我们预计解决方案业务的比重将会继续上升，推动公司盈利能
政府支出波动，竞争激烈程度改变。
我们将行业平均市盈率20 倍乘以大华2018 年预期每股盈利，得出12 个月目标
价格人民币190 元。
安防行业正在经历整合，大企业将从中受益。2016 年下半年行业需求复苏，价
存在业务关系，并且继续寻求发展这些关系。因此，投资者应当考虑
到本公司可能存在可能影响本报告客观性的利益冲突，不应视本报告

Overseas and solutions business to drive growth with RD focus
Global branding and sales network expansion
The surveillance business has a dumbbell-like structure with salesmarketing network and RD
on the two ends Dahua identifies market share as a very important focus point As of 2016 we
estimate Dahua had 85% market share in the domestic market and 29% market share in the
overseas market up from 43% and 05% in 2011 Currently overseas revenue accounts for 38%
to five years We expect overseas revenue to reach 50% of total revenue in 2019E
In terms of sales network Dahua has over 2000 in-house sales staff for the domestic markets
covering 280 regions and 3000 counties in China Its distribution networks reach further into the
countryside Dahua classifies its customers into three groups 1) smart citysafe city 2) big
enterprise and 3) SMEretail customers For city-level projects Dahua would send in an entire
customers Dahua uses in-house sales to cover on a consistent basis And for SMEretail
customers the distribution channel is put in play
For the overseas market Dahua is transforming itself away from being an OEM to overseas
surveillance productservice providers by 1) promoting its own-branded products through
distributors and 2) winning solutions project orders from countrycity governments (for example a
border project in Hungary a safe city project in Mexico a police force project in Turkey) Therere
over 1000 in-house salespeople covering overseas markets for Dahua 100 local salespeople in
North America facing big system integrators So far Dahua has set up 35 subsidiaries outside
China and management identifies global expansion to be a very important strategy Management
is planning to further invest in and expand its global sales network in the future

Transformation from distribution to solution
Dahua was established in 2001 and started out selling digital control dispatch machines and
DVRs Over the years it gradually expanded its product range to front-end cameras control
center equipment and software
For the first 15 years or so in China Dahua mainly relied on distributors to sell its products
Starting from 2014 Dahua ventured into the solutions market with the restructuring exercise of its
sales and RD teams The result of Dahuas restructuring can be seen in its revenue growth and
margin recovery from 2014 to 2016 In the overseas market Dahua was initially an OEM for
markets and promoting its own branded products In 2016 Dahua entered into the solutions
market overseas
Currently the solutions business already accounts for over 50% of Dahuas revenue in China
with slower progress in overseas markets In China Dahua has been quite active in terms of
大华股份 (002236SZ)
participating in PPP projects as an inroad into gaining more city-level solutions business We
believe PPP projects could initially boost Dahuas revenue growth However longer-term
profitability and cash flow levels are still uncertain

end 2016 Dahua had 5321 employees in its RD department (61% of total) and RD expense
as a percentage of revenue has consistently increased from 58% in 2007 to 107% in 2017
Going forward management expects RD expense as a percentage of revenue to stay above
10% at least Dahua established four research institutes in 2015-2016 focusing on chip big data
artificial intelligence and advanced applications The surveillance front-end industry has lived
through two waves of technology upgrade previously (1) from analog camera to IP camera and
(2) from isolated network structure to connected network structure Looking forward we believe
we are at the initial stage of the next wave of upgrade to AI-embedded surveillance products and
systems We are already seeing the change in the industry surveillance is evolving from simply
being the eyes of public and private sectors to being the eyes and brains in that it not only
business needs In this new intelligent era Dahua strives to be the intelligent IoT solutions
provider and service operator with a focus on video

Over the past decade Dahuas revenue was mainly driven by front-end products followed by back-end
products Going forward we expect front-end products will continue to be the biggest revenue driver as
Dahua continues to gain market share in both domestic and overseas markets
As of 2016 front-end products accounted for 49% of Dahuas revenue followed by 33% in back-end products
In 2017E we expect revenue growth to accelerate to 35% yoy from 32% yoy in 2016 mainly driven by
Dahuas expanding market share and active participation in PPP projects
In terms of geographic breakdown we note that Dahuas revenue contribution from overseas markets
expanded from 9% in 2005 to 38% in 2016 Going forward management expects overseas revenue to
contribute 60%-70% of the total in three to five years time In 2015 due to a higher contribution from the
solutions business gross margin in the overseas market surpassed gross margin in China Going forward we
expect revenue contribution from solutions to continue rising as a percentage of the total

In 2005-2016 Dahua grew its revenue by 45X from Rmb293mn to Rmb13329mn at a
CAGR of 41% mainly driven by the growth in its front-end product suite the share of which
increased from 1% of overall revenue in 2006 to 49% in 2016 This is mainly driven by the
rising penetration of surveillance cameras in China as well as overseas markets By 2020E
we expect Dahuas revenue to reach Rmb38121mn at a CAGR of 30% from 2016 Front-
end products will still be a big driver of this growth with incremental as well as
upgradereplacement demand for cameras and its contribution will increase to 57% by
2020E based on our estimates
In 2005-2016 Dahua grew its EPS by 30X from Rmb002 to Rmb063 or a CAGR of 36%
We notice that EPS growth lagged Dahuas revenue growth mainly as a result of declining
by a CAGR of 26% from 2016 slower than the revenue CAGR as a result of rising sales and
marketing spend on overseas expansion The surveillance industry has been consolidating
with big players such as Dahua gaining market share on a consistent basis In 2016 gross
margin improved by 05ppt after two years of decline and net margin improved by 01ppt
after two years of decline On the other hand we note small players profitability level
we believe Dahuas gross margin should continue to improve going forward
Dahua has consistently operated at a net cash position over the past decade As of 2016 its
net cash to EBITDA ratio was 11X implying a strong balance sheet
ROE was 25% in 2016 an improvement from 20142015 post its internal restructuring and
we expect it to stay relatively stable over the next three years
Dahuas cash conversion cycle also improved to 101 days in 2016 from 121 days in 2014
and 110 days in 2015 and we expect this to stabilize over the next three years
Dahuas capex as a percentage of revenue has been in a range of 2%-6% over the past ten
years and has consistently had positive and growing free cash flow (EBITDA  capex) and
Dahua announced a dividend of Rmb010 per share for FY2016 representing a payout ratio
in a range of 10% to 34% over the past eight years We forecast a 16% payout ratio in
大华股份 (002236SZ)
Valuation and stock price drivers
We forecast a 32% revenue CAGR and a 24% earnings CAGR for Dahua in 2016-2019E driven
by continued market share expansion and stabilizing profitability levels We apply the 20X
average PE multiple for Dahuas global and domestic peers in 2018E to Dahuas 2018E EPS to
arrive at a 12-month target price of Rmb190 implying 4% upside All the stocks included have
market caps of more than US1 bn
We believe PE is the most important valuation metric that investors are focused on and it is in
line with our valuation methodology for the A share tech space

Introducing MA framework for Dahua
We have previously examined our Asia Pacific technology coverage using an MA framework
(see Navigating the noise (6) Introduce MA framework update roadmap July 4 2016) In the
our assessment of three key factors
Firstly we look at whether there are any impediments such as shareholder
structurepreferences industry regulationsgovernment policies and takeover defense
strategies that could prevent a transaction from occurring We then consider four qualitative
factors 1) attractiveness of technology 2) attractiveness of customers 3) cost synergy potential
and 4) otherintangible value and two quantitative factors 1) market cap and 2) valuations
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
When assessing potential impediments we take into consideration
major shareholder preferences (we assume that shareholders with a 20% or greater
stake have significant influence or a blocking stake) and take into account any
potential actions by major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third
party (including whether they would likely be receptive or if they may be opposed to
regulatory and or government policy impediments and
possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill
We assign a No qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are applicable and
a Yes qualification if these considerations do not apply
Four qualitative assessment criteria
generating future value as well as its technological capabilities and intellectual property
rights We assign a rank of 4 if its technology is unattractive 3 if it is moderately
attractive 2 if it is attractive and 1 if it is very attractive
and product applications We also take customer retention and end-market exposure
(including sales channels) into account We assign a rank of 4 if its customer base and
product applications are unattractive 3 if they are moderately attractive 2 if they are
attractive and 1 if they are very attractive
Cost synergies We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for profit
of 4 if there is low possibility of synergies 3 if there is some possibility  2 if there is
high possibility and 1 if there is a very high possibility
including brand strength outstanding managementemployees and intangible assets
We assign a rank of 4 if they are unattractive 3 if they are moderately attractive 2 if
they are attractive and 1 if they are very attractive
大华股份 (002236SZ)
Two quantitative assessment criteria
regional qualities (such as differing market cap ranges between regions) into account
EVDACF are below the industrypeer average for the same period as we believe
industry peer group 3 if its valuation is in line with the peer average 2 if its valuation
is discounted and 1 if its valuation is significantly discounted We take into account
and their peers
Within this framework we assign an MA rank of 3 to Dahua
This is mainly due to its relatively large market cap of US7794mn and shareholding structure
(41% held by founder and Chairman Fu Liquan whose shareholding has been stable over time)
Exhibit 36 We assign an MA rank of 3 to Dahua                                                                                                              Dahua

Fluctuation in governmentpublic spending
As government- and public-related projects accounted for over 40% of total domestic
demand in 2016 we see fluctuation risks if there are any policy changes at the central
government level and spending delays at the local government level
For example in 2014-2015 demand in government-related projects slowed due to slowing
macroeconomic growth in China This led to Hikvisions revenue growth slowing down to
36% yoy and 37% yoy in 2014 and 2015 from 53% yoy in 2013 Starting in 2H16 industry
participants have noted a recovery in demand and this could pose an upside risk to our
forecasts
Competitive intensity
There are over 1500 surveillance product providers in China Although Dahuas size is much
low-end standardized distribution channels
ASP for mature surveillance products generally declines by 6%-7% yoy However in periods
of weaker demand surveillance product providers tend to cut pricing more aggressively in
order to protect market share and maintain revenue growth On the other hand products with
technology leadership and limited supply tend to have a high pricing premium initially
