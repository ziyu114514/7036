CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Naura Technology (002371 CH)
1H24 profit alert points to solid 2Q results
Naura announced a 1H24 profit alert 1H revenue is expected to be within the range
of RMB114-131bn representing 354% to 559% YoY growth respectively Net
profit is estimated to be RMB26-30bn (YoY growth of 428% to 645%) This implies
that 2Q24 revenue (mid-point) could be RMB64bn (408% YoY and 95% QoQ
growth) 5% below consensus estimate 2Q24 net profit (mid-point) is expected to be
RMB16bn (357% YoY and 454% QoQ growth) 9% above consensus estimate
attributed the growth to 1) its broad coverage of semiconductor equipment (etching
deposition cleanser etc) 2) increasing market share 3) economies of scale
gradually showing and 4) improving operational efficiency and stable decrease in
expense ratio Maintain BUY with an unchanged TP at RMB405

or 41%51% of Bloomberg consensus estimates
(RevNP RMB300bnRMB54bn) Revenue seasonality remains consistent
with mid-point 1H24 revenue representing 40% of that of FY24E (RMB309bn
per our forecast) similar to 1H23 (38% of FY23 revenue) This historical pattern
suggests the potential for strong sequential growth in 3Q-4Q24E in our view
 Looking forward to 2H24 we expect the pace of semi supply chain
localization in China to remain steady Naura signed new equipment orders
exceeding RMB30bn in 2023 with over 70% related to semiconductor
manufacturing tools We expect Naura to deliver robust revenue growth on capex
expansion from downstream clients (including memory and foundry) and the
beneficiaries amid the recently launched Big Fund III (US475bn) in China
 We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura with an unchanged TP at RMB405
based on 39x 2024E PE Naura is currently our favourite pick under the semi
peers and 2) escalating geopolitical tensions
