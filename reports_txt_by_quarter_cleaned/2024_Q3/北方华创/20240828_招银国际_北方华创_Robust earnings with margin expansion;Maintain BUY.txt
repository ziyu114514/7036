CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Naura Technology (002371 CH)
Robust earnings with margin expansion
Naura announced 1H24 results 1H revenue grew 464% YoY to RMB123bn
while NP grew 545% YoY to RMB28bn both aligning with the mid-point of
saw 38%46% in 1H23 GPM improved to 455% in 1H24 (vs 42%41% in
1H23FY23) while NPM expanded to 225% in 1H24 from 177% in FY23 We
intact Looking forward we expect Naura to 1) ride the tailwinds of
semiconductor localization trend 2) grow on product coverage expansion and
market share gains and 3) benefit from economies of scale and improving
GPM Reiterate BUY with TP unchanged at RMB405
 1H24 revenue in-line with expectation From a quarterly standpoint 2Q24
revenueNP increased by 422%370% YoY (vs 38%120% YoY in 2Q23)
and 105%468% QoQ We maintain our previous revenue projection for
equipment revenue increased by 551% YoY making up 92% of total
revenue (vs 87% in 1H23) We believe that escalating geopolitical tensions
coupled with the push for faster domestication of semiconductor equipment
enhanced revenue in 1H24 We expect the equipment segment to grow
459%285% YoY in 202425E and maintain our total revenue projection
at RMB309bnRMB390 for the same period implying 397%265%
 Better-than-expected GPM expansion driven by favourable product
mix and economies of scale 2Q GPM was 474% up 40ppt sequentially
We revised up our 202425E GPM forecasts by 52ppt39ppt as we believe
Naura will continue to benefit from these tailwinds and maintain GPM at a
similar level We revised up our 202425E NP forecasts by 9%1% on
higher GPM estimates The accretive impact will be partially offset by higher
RD and other operating expenses since Nauras priority is to expand its
product coverage
 We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura with an unchanged TP at
RMB405 The TP implies a valuation at 3577x 2024E PE close to 1SD
above 2-year historical average forward PE which we think is justified
considering Nauras leading position in domestic semiconductor equipment
market Naura is our favourite pick under the semiconductor localization
and 2) escalating geopolitical tensions
