CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Innolight (300308 CH)
Fundamentals remain strong despite recent
market volatility reiterate BUY
CSP3 (Three Cloud Service Providers namely Google Microsoft and Amazon)
plus Meta have announced their earnings recently The Big Four spent an
aggregate of US529bn in capex in 2Q24 (vs previous Bloomberg consensus
est of US506bn) representing a surge of 571% following 304% growth in
1Q24 The growth is on an already-high base after three years of growth hikes
in capex (38%34%19% YoY) from 2020-22 and reaching a nearly historical
peak (US148bn) in 2023 Like Sundar Pichai said on Alphabets 2Q24 earning
call the risk of under-investing is dramatically greater than the risk of over-
investing The Big Four confirmed that they will continue to make heavy
A number of investors have shown concern about the recent market turmoil in
the tech sector which we believe was driven primarily by 1) mixed earnings
presidential election Market sell-offs intensified even further after the
unexpected interest rate hike by the Bank of Japan as carry trades of USD and
yen unwind
Despite those noises we remain positive on the longer-term AI investment
theme as growth of major CSPs capex remained intact in 2Q24 As a key
beneficiary Innolight remains our top pick We think Innolights current
valuation (228x153x 202425E PE) appears attractive amid the recent market
pull-back (35% decline since peak in July) Reiterate BUY with new TP at
RMB1508 Previous target price of RMB13071 had already accounted for the
effects of ex-rights and ex-dividends
 The impact of Nvidias design flaws in new chips should be limited
Another concern on Innolight is Nvidias recent design flaws on its new GPU
chip (link) Investors worry this may lead to delay or even cancellations of
Nvidias products which may negatively affect the revenue outlook of
Innolights supply chain However the impact should be limited in our view
given that this issue has been identified in the early stage and is a solvable
technique difficulty The mass production of Blackwell chips will begin in
4Q24 and the majority of revenue contribution is expected to be in 2025 In
addition any impact of new chip shipment should be offset by an extended
lifecycle of H series
 Reiterate BUY with adjusted TP at RMB15076 We revise up revenue
forecasts by 6%11% and NP forecasts by 11%23% for 202425E on
capex forecasts from Feb and 5%8% increase from May) Based on recent
earnings calls hyperscalers will continue to invest in AI infrastructure
(39%13% capex growth for the Big Four in 202425E by Bloomberg
consensus) As a key beneficiary Innolights strong product portfolio
on this AI momentum The new TP is based on the same 30x 2024E PE
which is 9% higher than 5-year historical avg of forward PE (274x)
implying a PEG ratio close to 1x (vs 32% 2024-26E EPS CAGR) Therefore
we think Innolights current valuation (228x153x 202425E PE) looks
attractive Reiterate BUY Potential risks include 1) intensified geopolitical
tensions 2) slower-than-expected new product ramp-up progress 3)
slowdown in cloud capital spending and 4) supply chain bottlenecks
