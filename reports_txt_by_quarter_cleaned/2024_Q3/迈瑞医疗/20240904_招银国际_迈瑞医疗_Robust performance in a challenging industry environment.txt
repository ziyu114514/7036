CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Mindray (300760 CH)
Robust performance in a challenging industry
Mindray achieved a revenue of RMB205bn in 1H24 marking an 111% increase
YoY and reported an attributable net profit of RMB76bn up 174% YoY Despite the
ongoing regulatory adjustments in the healthcare industry and the delay in medical
equipment renewals projects which have led to a cautious approach towards bidding
and procurement activities in public hospitals the revenue from domestic equipment
business decreased by 12% YoY However thanks to the rapid growth of the IVD
business and the domestic high-endultra-high-end ultrasound business Mindray still
demonstrated strong resilience and steady growth The increase in the revenue share
from IVD reagents and high-end ultrasounds drove the Companys gross margin up
by 07 ppt YoY to 663% in 1H24 Additionally Mindray announced a mid-term
dividend plan distributing a total cash dividend of approximately RMB49bn which
represents a payout ratio of more than 65% indicating an ongoing increase in the
dividend payout
 Domestic equipment business faces pressure In 1H24 the continued delay
in bidding and procurement activities led to a 12% YoY decrease in revenue from
domestic equipment business Due to the high market share of Mindrays Patient
Monitoring and Life Support (PMLS) products in China the domestic business
was significantly affected by the industry environment with the PMLS segment
experiencing a 76% YoY decrease in revenue including about a 20% drop in
domestic revenue The Medical Imaging segment benefited from the volume
increase of the first domestic ultra-high-end ultrasound Resona A20 and other
high-end ultrasounds resulting in a 155% YoY revenue growth in this segment
with high-end and ultra-high-end ultrasound revenues increasing by over 40%
 Accelerating the shift towards consumables-related business In 1H24 the
IVD reagent business was minimally affected by domestic industry regulation
with revenue increasing by 28% YoY to RMB77bn accounting for over 37% of
total revenue Domestic IVD revenue grew by over 25% and domestic reagent
revenue increased by 30% with reagent revenue representing over 80% of
domestic IVD revenue Internationally Mindray successfully penetrated over 60
overseas third-party chain laboratories in 1H24 and installed the first MT 8000
TLA driving a more than 30% YoY increase in overseas IVD revenue We believe
that the continuous increase in domestic diagnostic demand and the
implementation of IVD VBP are expected to help Mindray rapidly expand its
domestic market share while accelerated cooperation with high-end clients will
support long-term rapid growth of the IVD overseas market Additionally the
minimally invasive surgery business grew by 90% YoY in 1H24 The Companys
acquisition of APT Medical also filled the gap in its cardiovascular consumables
business Currently consumables-related businesses led by IVD already account
for over 50% of the Companys domestic revenue
 Maintain BUY We believe that industry regulation has not affected the essential
and equipment renewal policies are implemented hospital procurement is
expected to gradually recover Based on a 9-year DCF model we adjust the
target price to RMB 35284 (WACC 103% perpetual growth rate 30%)
