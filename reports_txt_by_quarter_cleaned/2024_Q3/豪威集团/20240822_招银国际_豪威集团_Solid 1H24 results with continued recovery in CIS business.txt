01% HoH) MobileautoIoTmedical CIS grew 785%530%778%416%
YoY while securitynotebook CIS declined 267%90% YoY respectively
Without a broad recovery of end-market demand Willsemis CIS sales for

in domestic high-end Android market (ie new flagship OV50H sensor) 2)
demand for ADAS and in-cabin cameras continuing to increase to fulfill
autonomous driving and security needs 3) the industrial automation trend
and 4) inventory restocking behaviours We expect CIS sales to grow

segment revenue to grow 21%18% YoY in 202526E
 Touchdisplay business remains weak while analog segment shows
signs of recovery Touchdisplay revenue decreased 286% YoY due to
ongoing inventory digestion and ASP pressure Analog sales were up
247% YoY on improving market conditions and share gains We expect
touchdisplay segment to recover in 2025 driven by the introduction of low
power-consumption and auto-grade products Analog sales are forecasted
to grow double-digits on better market conditions and share increases
 Maintain BUY with slightly adjusted TP at RMB11539 based on 407x
2024E PE which is 1-SD above 1-year historical avg forward PE
given Willsemis leading market position and continuous share gains
We revise NP forecasts for 202425E by -1%3% on higher RD costs as
