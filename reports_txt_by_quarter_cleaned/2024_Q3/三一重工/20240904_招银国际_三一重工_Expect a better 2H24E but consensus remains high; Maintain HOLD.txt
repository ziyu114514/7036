overseas outlook despite the recent weakness of excavators in Europe and the

while the growth in emerging countries will continue to be strong For 2H24E
SANY expects Chinas sales to stabilize (-12% in 1H24) while overseas sales
growth will accelerate (48% in 1H24) Given that our 2024E-26E earnings
forecasts (unchanged after 1H24 results) remain 13-29% below consensus
even taking into consideration of growth acceleration in 2H we maintain our
HOLD rating with an unchanged TP of RMB148 based on 24x 2024E PE
