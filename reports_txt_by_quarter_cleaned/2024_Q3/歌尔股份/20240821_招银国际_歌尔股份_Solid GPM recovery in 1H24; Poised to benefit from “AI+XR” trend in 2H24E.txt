Goertek (002241 CH)
Solid GPM recovery in 1H24 Poised to benefit from
AIXR trend in 2H24E
Goerteks 1H24 revenue net profit growth of -11%190% YoY was largely in-
line with its earlier positive profit alert (net profit 180-200% YoY) 2Q24
revenuenet profit delivered 01%168% YoY and GPM came in at 136%
(44 ppts QoQ59 ppts YoY) mainly due to improving efficiency and better
acoustics productsmart product profitability Looking ahead to 2H24FY25E we
expect Goerteks earnings will continue to rebound given improving GPM and
better ARVRgaming demand with multiple product launches from major VRAR
players We raise FY24-26E EPS by 19-38% to reflect 1H24 results a stronger
GPM and better operating leverage In longer term we believe Goertek is well
positioned to capture opportunities in the ARVR product cycle from players
such as Meta Sony Google Samsung and Huawei Maintain BUY with new TP
of RMB259 based on rollover 25x FY25E PE (prior 25x FY24E PE)
 1H24 in-line with profit alert impressive GPM across all segments
Goerteks1H24 revenueattributable net profit growth of -11%190% YoY

in at 136% (44 ppts QoQ59 ppts YoY) mainly due to improving efficiency
and better acoustics productsmart product profitability
 2H2425 outlook Expect continued GPM recovery positive on AIXR
trend in 2H24E In addition to solid recovery of acoustic product segment
we believe Goertek is well positioned to benefit from new product launches
of Meta Quest 3S and Sony PS5 Pro gaming console in 2H24E along with
AR glass product launches from multiple players which should continue to
drive profitability recovery and topline growth Overall we expect Goerteks
net profit to grow 164%23% YoY in FY2425E
 Maintain BUY We think Goerteks industry leadership and product roadmap
in XRacousticsgaming segments will allow it to benefit from industry
FY2425E We lift our FY2425E EPS estimates by 19-38% mainly for better
GPM and operating efficiency Our new TP of RMB259 is based on a rolled-
