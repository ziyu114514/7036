Shengyi Tech (600183 CH)
Solid 1H24 earnings high copper price to have
modest impact in near term
Shengyi Tech released its 1H24 earnings Revenue improved by 222%
YoY106% HoH to RMB96bn driven by solid demand of AI servers growing
auto orders and inventory restocking During the same period GPM improved
to 216% (vs 193%192% in 1H2H23) benefiting from improving utilization
and a favorable product mix towards high-margin products Consequently NP
increased by 680% YoY531% HoH to RMB932mn 1H24 revenueNP
accounted for 47%43% of our FY24E forecast From a sequential perspective
Q2 revenueNP were up 26%76% YoY and 18%38% QoQ while GPM
increased to 218% (vs 213%189% in 1Q242Q23) The stock is currently
trading at 1SD below 5-year historical avg Given copper price is likely to
maintain at its highs we think Shengyis CCL business will gradually recover
Maintain BUY with TP unchanged at RMB2641
 By segment both CCL and PCB segments delivered double-digit
growth and margin expansion Shengyis CCLPrepreg sales increased
by 207% YoY with GPM improving by 20ppts PCB revenue increased by
235% YoY with GPM improving by 16ppts Sales from server and auto
investments According to the mgmt PCB revenue from server market
accounted for 38% of the segment sales in 1H24 up 20% from 1H23
 CCL business is likely to recover on elevated copper price 3M LME
copper prices peaked above US10kt in May before retreating to US9kt
by late-July Current price is US93kt We believe the impact from copper
price volatility was mild in 1H (Shengyis CCL GPM was up 12ppt from
2H23) Based on recent channel check the downstream saw some material
price adjustment starting from 2Q If copper price maintains at current level
we expect Shengyis CCL ASP is likely to increase We project the
12ppts each year) on higher sales contribution from AI (Shengyi achieved
mass shipment in 1H) rising CCL ASP and better consumer sentiment
 Maintain BUY with unchanged TP at RMB2641 implying a 10%
premium to its 5-year historical avg forward PE considering its AI upside
202425E NP forecasts are slight adjusted by 1%-2% The stock is currently
trading at 1SD below 5-year historical avg of 26x Maintain BUY Potential
risks include copper price volatility and weaker-than-expected demand
