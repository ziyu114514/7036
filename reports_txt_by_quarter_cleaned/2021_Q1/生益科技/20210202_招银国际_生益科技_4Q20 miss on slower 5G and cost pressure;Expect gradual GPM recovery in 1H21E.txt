Shengyi Tech announced FY20 preliminary results with revenuenet profit of
RMB14687mn1663mn up 11%14% YoY and earnings is 12%10% below
ourconsensus estimates By 4Q20 revenuenet profit grew 6%-116% YoY
deployment in 4Q20 and 2) margin pressure with copper price hike given delayed
cost transfer to downstream clients We cut FY20-22E estimates by 10-13% to
reflect more conservative assumptions and trimmed our TP to RMB2945 based
on same 30x FY21E PE We expect Shengyis GPM to improve in next 1-2
quarters given that CCL price will start to rise in 1Q21E Maintain BUY
Weaker 4Q20 due to slower 5G deployment and cost hike With over 30%
BTS deployment in 4Q20 and 2) lower gross margin given delay of cost
transfer (eg copper) to downstream clients Given continued copper price
hike we expect Shengyi will start to raise CCL ASP in 1Q21E and gross
margin will gradually improve in FY21E
 Capacity expansion of prepreg and CCL to drive future growth Shengyi
announced a new project last week to add 114mn sq m capacity for CCL
and 36mn m capacity for prepreg Total investment is RMB945mn which will
be funded by own capital or financing Total construction period will be 15
months and production will start in 3Q22E Shengyi expected new capacity
to generate RMB1319mn143mn revenuenet profit each year The new
and wearables We believe it will help Shengyi to diversify revenue sources
and accelerate expansion into consumer electronics and automobile markets
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB2945 We trimmed our FY20-22E EPS
by 10-13% and lower TP to RMB2945 (same 30x FY21PE) reflecting more
conservative revenue and margin assumptions Trading at 238x FY21E PE
close to 1-sd below historical PE the stock is attractive in our view Near-
term catalysts include increase in CCL price and 5G BTS tenders Potential
risks include slower-than-expected transfer of material costs and delay in 5G

Maintain BUY and lower TP to RMB2945 (26% upside)
We trimmed our TP to RMB2945 based on same 30x FY21E PE in line with 1-year
historical forward PE We believe this is justified as the stock has been mostly trading on
26-36x EPS We estimate 26% EPS FY20-23E CAGR backed by 23% revenue CAGR
given that 1) next phase of 5G tenders is believe to resume soon 2) GPM will improve as
CCLs ASP is expected to increase to reflect the material cost pressure and 3) new capacity
for pregregCCLPCB and the diversification in downstream applications Potential risks
include slower-than-expected transfer of material costs and delay in 5G upgrades
