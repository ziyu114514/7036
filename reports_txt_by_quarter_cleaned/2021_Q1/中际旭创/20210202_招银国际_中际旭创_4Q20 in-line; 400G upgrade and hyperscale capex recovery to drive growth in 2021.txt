Innolight announced FY20E preliminary net profit of RMB780mn-905mn up 52%-
76% YoY with mid-point of RMB843mn (64% YoY) largely in-line with our
consensus estimates of RMB870863mn By 4Q20 we estimate revenuenet
profit of RMB1909mn252mn up 30%62% YoY The strong result was driven by
robust data traffic and increasing capex from globalchina hyperscalers We
slightly adjusted our estimates for 4Q20 results and revised our TP to RMB 7266
is based on same 42x FY21E PE (2-year historical average) Innolight now
trades at lower end of its historical valuation band and we believe concerns over
catalysts include stronger cloud capex and 5G deployment
FY20 NP largely in-line Solid growth in Q4 Innolight reported FY20
preliminary net profit of RMB780-905mn (52%-76% YoY) largely in-line
with ourconsensus estimates mainly driven by global hyperscale capex
and rapid 400G upgrade For 4Q20 we estimate revenuenet profit grew
25%62% YoY (vs 57%56% YoY in 3Q20) given slower China 5G
deployment but improving margins due to better product mix and yield of
400G products
 Expect strong demand pick-up in 2Q3Q21E Looking into FY21E we
expect weaker 1Q21E on seasonality and sequential demand pick-up into
global largest supplier of 100G200G400G optical modules and increasing
expect Innolight to deliver 29%37% revenueNP CAGR during FY20-22E
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB7266 We reiterate BUY and adjusted
our target price to RMB7266 based on same 419x FY21E PE after slight
revision of our forecasts Trading at 297x FY21E PE (1-sd below 2-year
slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and higher ASP pressure

Maintain BUY with new TP RMB7266 (415% upside)
We derived our new 12m TP of RMB7266 based on same 419x FY20E PE in line with
its 2-year historical average We believe this is justified as Innolight is the industry leader
weaker capex from cloud giants slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and ASP pressure
