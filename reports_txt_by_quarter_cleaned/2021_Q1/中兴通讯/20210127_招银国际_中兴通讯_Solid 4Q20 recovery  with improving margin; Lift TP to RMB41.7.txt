ZTE announced FY20 preliminary results with revenuenet profit growth of 117%
-153% YoY largely in-line with ourconsensus estimates thanks to solid growth
across all segments share gain in China and improving profitability overseas By
4Q20 revenuenet profit grew 3%62% YoY to RMB273bn166bn In a mixed
backdrop of global 5G deployment and macro uncertainties we believe ZTE is
well positioned to seize the opportunities from New Infrastructure initiative and
5G network upgrade amid Huawei uncertainties We slightly revised our forecasts
and raised our TP to RMB417 based on same 312x FY21E PE Catalysts
include 5G BTS tenders and 2021 operator capex budget
 FY20 largely in-line Solid growth across all segments Despite
challenges from COVID-19 and macro uncertainties ZTE achieved sales
growth of 117% YoY in FY20E driven by solid growth from both domestic
and overseas markets and all three business segments (carriers network
consumer business and governmentcorporate business) Net profit declined
153% YoY in FY20 mainly due to one-time asset disposal gain in 3Q19
 Improving operating and financial metrics ZTE reported record-high
operating cashflow of RMB1023bn in FY20E up 374% YoY while gearing
ratio improved to 695% from 731% in FY19 We believe ZTE will continue
to improve its working capital and optimize balance sheet structure
 Major beneficiary of global 5G deployment As we believe Chinese
operators will kick off next 5G BTS tender in 1Q21E we expect 5G BTS net-
adds to reach 800k1mn (including CBN) in FY21E22E and ZTEs 5G market
share in China will gradually ramp to 35% (vs 30% in FY20) Thanks to global
economic recovery and resumption of 5G BTS rollout post COVID-19 we
expect domesticoverseas revenue from carriers network to grow at 9%18%
CAGR during FY21-23E
 Reiterate BUY Lift TP to RMB417 We adjusted our forecasts to reflect
better operating leverage and new FX assumptions We slightly raised our
target price to RMB417 based on same 312x FY21E PE in line with 2-year
historical forward PE Trading at 255x FY21E PE (1-sd below 2-year avg)
we think the stock is attractive vs 26% EPS FY21-23E CAGR Risks include

Maintain BUY and raised TP to RMB 417 (225% upside)
We slightly raised our TP to RMB417 based on 312x FY21E PE in line with 2-year
historical forward PE We believe this is justified as the stock has been mostly trading on
25-37x EPS except the period during negative earnings in 2012 2016 and 2018 We
estimate 26% EPS FY21-23E CAGR backed by 11% revenue CAGR and improving GPM
as 5G scales up Trading at 255x FY21E PE (1-sd below 2-year avg) we think the stock
deployment delays
