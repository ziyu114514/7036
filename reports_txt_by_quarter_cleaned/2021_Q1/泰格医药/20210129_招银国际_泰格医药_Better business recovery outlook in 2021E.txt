 Earnings beat in 2020 Tigermed announced positive profit alert that its
attributable net profit in 2020 rallied 100-115% YoY to RMB1683-1810mn
(higher than our estimate of 90% YoY growth) and attributable recurring net
profit grew 20-33% YoY to RMB670-742mn (vs our estimate of 23% YoY
growth) Tigermed recognized RMB10-11bn one-off fair value gains and
investment gains in 2020 vs RMB283mn one-off gains in 2019
 Strong growth momentum continued despite challenging COVID-19
pandemic in 2020 Recall that Tigermeds operation was interrupted by
COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 As the pandemic got largely controlled in
China clinical trial operations started to normalize from 2Q20 leading to
recovery in Tigermeds domestic revenue However the pandemic remained
serious in overseas regions such as the US and Europe As a result the
overseas CRO demand such as data management services and Frontages
BIO CMC DMPK services were negatively impacted In 1H20 Tigermed
received 42% of total revenue from overseas and 40% of gross profit from
overseas We forecast Tigermed to register 27% YoY revenue growth in
2H20E accelerating from 9% YoY growth in 1H20 Looking into 2021 we
expect the COVID-19 epidemic to gradually ease thanks to the wide
availability of vaccines which will drive further business recovery for Tigermed
We expect Tigermeds revenue growth to accelerate to 30% YoY in 2021E
and 28% YoY in 2022E
 Global expansion to drive long-term growth Given Chinas large patient
in MRCTs to speed up the enrollment of patients Meanwhile Chinese biotech
in overseas countries Tigermed provides clinical CRO services for Chinese
innovative drugs to go global and multinational enterprises drugs to enter
Chinese market Meanwhile we expect Tigermed to further expand its
operations The Company already has established networks in Asia Pacific
regions while US market could be the next emphasis
 Maintain BUY We raised our 2020E21E net profit forecasts by 82%03%
respectively to factor in one-off gains and strong core business growth We
raised our DCF-based TP to RMB18723 (WACC 984% Terminal growth
