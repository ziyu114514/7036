UpDownside
Goertek pre-announced FY20 revenuenet profit growth of 64%123% YoY
which reached upper end of its prior earnings guidance (115-125% YoY) We
maintain our positive view on Goerteks outlook backed by upcycle of AirPods
WatchHomePod better product mix and recovery of ARVR demand We raised
FY21E22E EPS by 16-18% to reflect stronger revenue and fine-tuned margins
Our new TP of RMB469 is based on lowered 35x FY21E PE (vs prior 40x) given
recent weaker sector sentiment We believe stock price pullback on recent mgmt
changes provides good buying opportunity given Goerteks product roadmap and
high earnings visibility of 36% FY20-22E EPS CAGR Maintain BUY
 Strong 4Q20 results on AirPods momentum and improving yield Goertek
reported upbeat 4Q20 earnings with revenuenet profit of RMB229bn838mn
up 108%184% YoY We attribute this to 1) higher share and improving yield
for AirPods 2) stronger ARVR products (new Oculus) and 3) better demand
for new products (AirPods Max HomePod mini) For FY20 we estimate
products (watch VR) grew 20%65%59% YoY
 2021 Outlook AirPods and ARVR as dual growth engines We estimate
AirPods shipment will grow 45%22% YoY to 94mn115mn in FY20E21E and
Goerteks share allocation will expand from 23% in FY20 to 37%41% in
FY2122E driving AirPods revenue growth of 103%23% YoY in addition we
expect Goertek VRAR segment will regain traction with 40%30% YoY growth
in FY2120E backed by new product cycle from Oculus Quest and Sony
PSVR in 2H20E
 Share repurchase program announced Goertek announced a new share
repurchase program of RMB500mn-1bn with price no more than RMB390 per
share equivalent to 1282mn-2564mn share and 039-078% of its total
shares outstanding We believe the share buyback signaled mgmts strong
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB469 We revised up our FY21-22E EPS
by 16-18% to reflect stronger revenue and fine-tuned margins Our FY2122E
EPS are 11%7% above consensus and our new TP of RMB469 is based on
lowered 35x FY21E PE (vs prior 40x) due to recent weaker sector sentiment
We believe recent correction offers good opportunity to accumulate the stock
