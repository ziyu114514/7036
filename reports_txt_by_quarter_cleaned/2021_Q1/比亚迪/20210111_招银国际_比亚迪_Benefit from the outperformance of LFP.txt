BYD delivered outstanding auto sales in Dec NEV sales reached 29K with
flagship Han EV shipment exceeded 12k units in Dec NEV sales volume had
accounted for 44% of total auto sales in 2020 Looking ahead in 2021E we still
see several positive catalysts for BYD from 1) new DM EV model to boost sales
2) cooperation with DiDi to take the lead in the ride-hailing renewable cycle 3)
power battery capacity expansion to support EV sales and 4) semiconductor
segment spin-off to release business value We revised up BYDs TP by 31% to
RMB2932 Reiterate BUY rating
 NEV sales speeded up in Dec BYD announced that total auto sales volume
achieved 56K units in Dec 30% YoY4%MoMIn Dec NEV reached 29K
120%YoY (NEPV 28K157%YoY NECV 1K-48%YoY) Delivery of Han
continued to climb with a total of 12K units in Dec up 196%MoM The annual
cumulative sales volume was 427K units-7%YoY in line with CMBI
expectation
 China NEV sales growth to accelerate in 2021E We expect that the sales
volume of NEV in China will continue to rise at a high speed in 2021E Given
1) the strong NEV pipeline among all major OEMs 2) the product recognition
from retail consumers 3) the beginning of the first round of replacement cycle
in ride-hailing business 4) the gradual introduction of LFP version for existing
models we expect the penetration rate of NEV will exceed market
expectations Specifically we expect the penetration rate of NEV to reach 7%
in 2021E with a corresponding sales volume of 192mn units representing an
increase of 57% (166mn NEPV260K NECV)
 NEV sales volume to increase 99% in 2021E We estimate BYDs NEV
market share declined to 15% in 2020 due to epidemic impacts and late
release of new vehicle model Starting from 2021 BYD will use a brand new
logo and launch several new models including Qin Plus (based on the latest
super hybrid DM-i platform) Song Pro DM etc We expect those measures
will boost its NEV sales At the to-B end we expect the cooperation model D1
between BYD and DiDi to take lead in the ride-hailing renewable cycle We
estimate D1 to have 66K units shipment in 2021E As we believe the
Companys NEV sector to maintain strong recovery we expect BYDs market
share in NEPV to continue to rebound to 20% and that will boost NEV sales
volume to 364K units in 2021E 99%YoY We think BYD will gradually shift
its business focus to NEV from ICE (61% vs 39% in 2021E) and maintain

Benefit from the outperformance of LFP
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
 2020E earnings to reach RMB53bn Given the updated sales volume and
sales mix we revised our net profit forecast by 1% to RMB53bn in 2020E
At the same time we expect a more optimistic sales forecast of NEPV in
2021E from 300K units to 364K units As a result we raised our 2021E
bottom-line by 11% to RMB77bn
 Strong LFP battery demand boost segment valuation We revised the
2025E PE multiple for the power battery segment from the previous 25x to
35x We observe a gradual increase in the market share of the LFP battery
The main reasons are from two aspects 1) driven by a sharp price cut by
Tesla the NEV industry has a strong demand for cost reduction and domestic
NEV players are facing the pressure of continuous cost reduction which lead
to increasing LFP battery installation for new EV models 2) BYDs blade
battery taking advantage of high volume density can reduce the cost while
making up for the short mile range to a certain extent which can make up for
the subdivision of LFP At present BYDs blade battery is still in the ramp-up
period of production capacity while accumulating certain potential demand as
state above We therefore raise the valuation multiple of the power battery
segment to reflect a more optimistic shipment expectation We adopted 2025E
valuation of the battery sector at RMB189bn
 BYD semiconductor to spin off in 2021E On 31 Dec 2020 BYD announced
that it plans to spin off and list its holding subsidiary BYD semiconductor The
main products of BYD semiconductor are IGBT modules and 3rd-generation
semiconductor products (SiC) At present BYD is planning to build its own
BYD SiC will fully replace IGBT to increase vehicle mileage by about 10% in
2023E We are optimistic about BYDs technology accumulation in the field of
vehicle-grade semiconductors The third-generation semiconductors (GaN
and SiC) are very suitable for high voltage devices due to their wide bandgap
characteristics The electronic saturation speed of GaN is high which is
suitable for making microwave devices It is applied to RF front-end amplifiers
of mobile phones 5G base stations and microwave radars The main
application areas of SiC focused on by BYD are still in the field of electronic
control and charging piles of NEV At the same time with the construction of
the 5G base station entering the accelerating stage the demand for small
base stations (micro base stations) is gradually released In the future
equipment suppliers will adopt the design of GaN-on-SiC based on silicon
carbide substrate as the power supply module which can achieve higher
power density (to avoid the large amount of heat management hardware
required by LDMOS thus reducing the size of the base station) to meet the
high frequencyhigh power requirements of their base stations We believe
that after the spin-off of BYD semiconductor it is expected to achieve further
independent operation so as to expand the product matrix to adapt to different
downstream needs and open up the valuation space

 Pending to have H-share placement BYD submitted application materials
for issuing additional H-share to CSRC With reference to listing rules of both
the H and A-share market we think H-share issuance will have the highest
funding raising efficiency Boosted by current thrilling market sentiment the
H-A discount is at a close level We expect BYDs new share placement to
have a limited pricing discount and dilution impact to EPS and rapid
fundraising will help BYD accelerate power battery capacity expansion to meet
surging market demand for blade battery We think the placement will further
enhance BYDs leading position in the power battery segment and boost the
business external shipment pace which will likely release the segments
 Revise valuation maintain BUY  We estimate BYD is currently trading at
2021E 66x NEV PS and 30x 2025E power battery PE according to our
SOTP valuation model We think both sectors current valuation is far behind
corresponding peers Based on our revised NEV sales outlook and optimistic
NEV sales mix in total auto sales volume we lifted 2021E NEV PS to 9x and
boost power batter valuation slightly from 25x to 35x then discount back Our
segment valuation for Autopower batterysemi-conductor business is
RMB65671893160bn Applying 15% conglomerate discount we derived
BYDs valuation at RMB7999bn with TP of RMB2932 for A-share (HK3000
for H-share) Maintain BUY rating
