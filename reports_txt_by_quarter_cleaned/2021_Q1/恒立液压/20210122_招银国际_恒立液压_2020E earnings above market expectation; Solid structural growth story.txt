Henglis released a positive profit alert yesterday stating that the net profit in
2020E is expected to surge 58%-77% YoY to RMB205-230bn The mid-point
(RMB217bn) is in line with our estimate of RMB218bn but higher than the
consensus of RMB206bn We believe it is a positive surprise to the market We
revised up Henglis earnings forecast in 2021E22E by 4%6% (9%7% above
consensus) after revising up our sales volume assumption We believe the next
on 65x 2021E PE (50% premium to the historical average of 43x)
 Profit surprise in 2020E Henglis net profit in 2020E is expected to surge
58%-77% YoY to RMB205-23bn This implies net profit of RMB575-828mn
in 4Q20 up 52%-118% YoY The earnings growth was driven by strong
downstream demand (excavator) that boosted the sales of hydraulic cylinders
pump and valve market share gain as well as the reduction of SGA expense
 We forecast a solid growth of excavator demand in 2021E For the industry
as a whole major manufacturers of excavator delivered sales volume of 328k
units in 2020 up 39% YoY according to CCMA In 4Q20 excavator sales
grew 61% YoY In 2021E we expect excavator demand to grow 10% YoY
(industry) driven by infrastructure spending growth continuous trend of the
substitution of labour and wheel loaders
 We expect Hengli to deliver strong sales in 1Q21E We estimate Hengli
production volume of hydraulic cylinder (for excavator) surged 75% YoY in
Jan Besides we expect the production volume of pump valve and motor to
remain strong Based on our new assumptions we forecast Henglis sales
volume of hydraulic cylinder (for excavator) to grow 20% YoY in 2021E while
sales volume of pump and valve to grow 40% YoY
 Structural growth trajectory remains solid We forecast Henglis market
share in hydraulic cylinder to increase from 50% in 2020E to 59% in 2022E
Besides we expect pump  valve for large-size excavators as well as non-
