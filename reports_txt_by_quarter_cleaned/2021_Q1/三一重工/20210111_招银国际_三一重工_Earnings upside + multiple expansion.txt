UpDownside
We see potential re-rating opportunity on SANY given that (1) excavator demand
sustainable (2) SANYs digital transformation strategy will help widen its
opportunity As such we believe market will gradually price SANY as a growth
stock instead of a cyclical growth We revised up our earnings forecast in 2020E-
22E by 6-14% Our new TP of RMB495 is based on 22x 2021E PE (up from 17x)
on the back of 22% earnings growth in 2021E We believe surprise on excavator
demand in 1Q21E will serve as a strong near-term catalyst Reiterate BUY
the digital transformation of intelligent manufacturing years ago which has
enabled SANY to gradually achieve higher production efficiency In 2019
SANYs revenue per employee reached US590k surpassing that of
more light tower plants and further digital transformation we expect SANYs
 Overseas opportunity Caterpillar generated 60% of revenue outside the
US while Komatsu (6301 JP) generated 70% of revenue outside Japan for
years We see huge potential for SANY to expand outside China given that
oversea accounted for 20% of total revenue between 2019 and 1H20 With
enhancing products quality and the continuous sales network construction we
earnings trend of SANY going forward which will help boost the valuation
 Higher industry forecast on excavator According to CCMA excavator
sales by major producers in China increased 39% YoY to 328k units in 2020
a record high Going forward we see the continuous replacement of labour
substitution of wheel loader and tightening emission standard as structural
growth drivers We revise up our excavator demand growth forecast in 2021E
to 10% from 3% Based on the feedback from the upstream supply chain we
expect the excavator demand growth will remain strong in 1H21E We expect
excavator sales growth of 70% YoY in 2M21E which should surprise the
market on the upside
 Key risks (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic (2) Slowdown of
construction activities (3) Risk of expanding to financing business
