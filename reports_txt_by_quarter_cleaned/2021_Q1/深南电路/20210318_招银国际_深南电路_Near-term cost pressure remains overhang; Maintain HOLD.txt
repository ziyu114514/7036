We hosted a NDR call with Shennan mgmt this week and investors mainly
capacity expansion For FY20 Shennan reported revenue of RMB119bn (10%
YoY) and net profit of RMB14bn (16% YoY) in-line with ourconsensus estimates
mainly driven by 8%33% YoY growth in PCBIC substrate and 4% YoY decline
in PCBA Looking into 2021 we expect PCBPCBA to grow 15%5% thanks to
YoY on strong demand and supply tightness We revised down our FY2122E
EPS by 1814% to reflect cost pressure and lower ASP and adjusted our TP to
RMB978 based on lower 30x FY21E PE Maintain HOLD
Positive outlook for PCB demand on 5G rollout recovery and improved
weaker growth of 8%-4% YoY in FY20 given slower 5G BTS build-out in
2H20 after a strong ramp in 1H20 while IDCauto products grew 58%50%
YoY Looking into 2021 we believe PCB segment will regain its strength as
1) China 5G deployment will reaccelerate in 1H21E (3rd batch 5G BTS
tender in Mar-Apr) and overseas demand is recovering as COVID-19 is
easing 2) Nantong (2nd phase) is expected to reach its full capacity this
year and 3) product mix will continue to improve as autoserver demand
remains strong
Capacity expansion on track for IC substrate segment Shennans IC
segments (30%20%20% of substrate rev) As 2020 was a big year for
semiconductor IC substrate segment grew 33% YoY and we expect strong
momentum will continue into 2021 given solid demand and recent supply
tightness Mgmt expect capacity of Wuxi plant will reach full utilization in 1H22E
Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB978 We trimmed FY21-22E EPS by
14-18% for lower ASPmargin assumptions and reduced our TP to
RMB978 based on lower 300x FY21E PE (vs prior 324x) We maintain
HOLD and expect near-term pressure on the stock due to 1) price pressure
on PCB de-spec for 700MHz 5G BTS and 2) rising laminate cost starting
from late 1Q21E  Potential risks include lower 5G CAPEX from telco and
raw material cost hike
