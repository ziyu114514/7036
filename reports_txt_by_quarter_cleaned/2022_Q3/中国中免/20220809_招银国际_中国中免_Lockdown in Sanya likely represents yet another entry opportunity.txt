Sanyas Omicron subvariant BA512 outbreak has led to 700 positive cases as
of yesterday and has prompted the city to initiate lockdown again subsequent to
the one in April this year In response to this CTGDF has suspended its Sanya
operation (Sanya DFS Mall phase 1 and 2) starting from 5 Aug (same day as the
lockdown was initiated) until further notice Judging from past experience we
estimate that Sanyas social distancing policies will last for a month or so This
would undoubtedly put a pause on the recovery that we have seen in June and
July when August is at the core of the summer travel season The incident has
prompted us to lower our 2022E revenue by 149% considering also the
preliminary results announcement for 2Q Meanwhile we raise our 2022E GPM
by 14pp to factor in an improved discount discipline of the Hainans duty free
business and these in aggregate explain to an 81% cut in our 2022E net profits
and put us 66% below consensus That said similar to many other outbreaks in
the past any disruptions from lockdowns to tourist traffic would only represent
temporary drags to share price in our view If the situation gets under control
within August we still see scope for travel demand to recover sequentially into
4Q particularly when the quarter is seasonally clustered with festivals and
shopping campaigns We remain BUY-rated
An update on Hainans current outbreak 827 confirmed positive cases
were reported during 1-7 Aug in the province with 689 cases being reported
in Sanya Local government has initiated a lockdown and implemented city-
wide nucleic acid tests Meanwhile inbound outbound flights and public
transportations are suspended Tourists are permitted to return home only if
negative nucleic acid test results on day 1 2 3 5 and 7)
Solid July momentum The Department of Commerce of Hainan Province
reported over RMB5bn (21% YoY) sales for offshore duty-free operators
with RMB4bn duty-free sales (9% YoY) The number extended from the
strength in June in which CTGDF reported a 13% YoY sales growth
Valuation Our new TP is based on an updated 450x (from 465x) roll-
forward mid-23E PE (from end-22E) which still represents 2-year average
since 2020 We raised our target multiple in our last upgrade report to reflect
the potential re-rating driven by the sequentially recovering though bumpy
domestic tourist traffic over 2H22
