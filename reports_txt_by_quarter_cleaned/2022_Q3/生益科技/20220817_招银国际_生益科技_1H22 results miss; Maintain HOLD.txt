UpDownside
Shengyi Techs 2Q22 revenueNP to shareholders declined 135% YoY479%
YoY to RMB4607mnRMB453mn 2Q results miss was due to 1) weak demand
from consumer markets 2) ASP pressure due to peers aggressive price war and
3) significant energy cost increase GPM decreased slightly to 232% in 2Q from
236% in 1Q Looking forward we expect PCB to outperform CCL business
driven by capacity ramp up for auto market and easing margin pressure We cut
our forecasts for 202223E and slightly tweaked TP to RMB192 Maintain HOLD
 CCL business under pressure CCLprepreg sales declined 183%44%
YoYQoQ in 2Q (vs 40%-48% in 1Q) GPM decreased to 227% in 1H22
from 257%293% in 2H211H21 2Q may be the weakest quarter for CCL
due to deteriorating demand and price war However 2H22 could still be
challenging as market demand is still on its way of slow recovery especially
for consumers ASP should have reached the bottom given little room to cut
price further
 PCB business to continue outperform PCB sales grew 142%91%
YoYQoQ in 2Q (vs 72%-122% in 1Q) GPM decreased to 212% in 1H22
from 165%188% in 2H211H21 The majority of PCB sales were from the
the auto market Auto PCB has experienced fast growth in 2021 with revenue
contribution increasing from 1% to 8% thanks to production ramp up
Prismark forecasts PCB market to grow 42% YoY in 2022 moderate growth
after significant growth of 241% YoY in 2021 We think Shengyi will
outperform peers driven by strong demand from auto market increasing
capacity and easing margin pressure
 Maintain HOLD TP adjusted to RMB192 We cut Shengyis FY22-23E
revenue by 9%-10% considering CCL demand recovery could be slow We
derive our TP using the same 166x target PE multiple avg 1-yr forward
PE TP was adjusted to RMB192 on valuation rollover to 2023E PE
Potential downside risks include 1) worse-than-expected global economy that
curbs consumer spending 2) continuous ASP pressure and 3) increasing
manufacturing costs ie energy costs
