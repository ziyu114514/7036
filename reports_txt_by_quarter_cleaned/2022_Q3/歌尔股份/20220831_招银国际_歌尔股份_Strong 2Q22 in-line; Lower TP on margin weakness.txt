Goertek (002241 CH)
Strong 2Q22 in-line Lower TP on margin weakness  in -line
Goerteks 2Q22 revenue NP growth of 45%54% YoY is largely in-line with its
preliminary results and 2Q GPM is slightly lower at 123% (-2ppt YoY -14ppt
QoQ) due to product mix and new product ramp Also Goertek reported soft
3Q22 prelim earnings of 95%-407% YoY growth which is below expectations
due to weaker VR demand and macro weakness Looking into 2H22E we
believe Goerteks growth momentum will continue with multiple product launches
from new-gen AirPods Quest 2 Pro and PS VR2 Overall we expect Goertek to
remain the major beneficiary of ARVR product cycle in 2023E and deliver
28%23% YoY earnings growth in FY2223E backed by 62%26% YoY in smart
product segment (VR gaming console smart watch) Maintain BUY with new
TP to RMB4469 based on same 28x FY22E PE (7-yr hist avg)
 Strong 2Q22 on solid VRgaming console despite margin pressure
Goertek reported solid 2Q22 results with revenuerecurring NP growth of
45%54% YoY in-line with its preview earlier Given Android demand
11%8% YoY offsetting strong smart product (Watch ARVR gaming
console) of 119% YoY In addition 2Q GPM came in at 123% (-2ppt YoY -
14ppt QoQ) due to weaker product mix and new product ramp up For
407% YoY below expectations due to macro weakness and soft VR
 2023 Outlook ARVR and gaming console as dual growth engines We
believe Goerteks VRAR and gaming segment will continue to be major
growth drivers (51%55% of FY2223E sales) which will grow at 62%26%
YoY in FY2223E backed by new product cycle from Oculus Quest 2 Pro and
Sony PS VR 2 in 2H22E as well as share gain in Sony PS 5 In addition
mgmt maintained positive view with ARVRMR shipment target of 50-60mn
unit in 2025 backed by a new wave of product launches from Meta Pico and
Apple in next two years
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB4469 We trimmed our FY22-24E EPS
by 3-7% to reflect lower margin and near-term macro weakness Our new TP
of RMB4469 is based on same 28x FY22E PE based on 7-year hist avg
PE We believe recent pullback provides good buying opportunities (165x
FY23E PE) given its solid product roadmap and growth opportunities in
ARVR and gaming console biz
