Shennan Circuits 2Q22 revenueNP to shareholders grew 158%331% YoY
and 103%162% QoQ GPM stabled at 26% (vs 225%-246% for 1Q21-4Q21)
benefiting from easing material cost pressure and product structure adjustment
For 2022 Prismark forecasts PCB market to grow 42% YoY moderate growth
after significant growth of 241% YoY in 2021 Again substrate market will lead
the growth For Shennan we expect the PCBsubstrate sales to grow 88%189%
respectively driven by capacity ramp up and growing demand from auto markets
Total revenue growth is estimated at 77% for 2022 Overall we think the
Company will continue to face challenges such as 1) slowdown of domestic 5G
demand We maintain HOLD and lower our TP to RMB966
 Although auto PCB capacity is ramping up and segment margin
improves PCB segment outlook remains cautious PCB sales grew 196%
datacenter and auto electronics markets As Nantong phase III factory is
ramping up capacity we believe auto PCB sales will deliver decent growth
this year Meanwhile material price is declining from the peak which helps
Shennans PCB GPM improve to 273% in 1H22 (vs 248% in 2H21)
However we maintain our cautious outlook given detailed timeline of 5G
deployment and upgrade of new datacenter platform is still unclear Although
the strong growth from auto PCB could partially offset these impacts its
revenue contribution is still insignificant (est 5% in 2021)
 Substrate demand weakening and supply chain constraint is easing
Substrate sales grew 248% YoY in 1H22 mainly driven by new capacity
released from Wuxi Phase II factory The results was solid after a good year
for substrate in 2021 (segment rev growth of 563% YoY) However we think
the unbalanced supplydemand situation is improving as consumer demand
is weakening
 Maintain HOLD and lower TP to RMB966 We think Shennan is doing its
best to navigate through macro uncertainties However we maintain our
cautious outlook for PCB segment and lowered our FY2223E EPS forecasts
by 9%12% TP cut to RMB966 equal to 23x FY23E PE 1SD below avg
2-yr historical forward PE Potential upside 1) stronger recovery in consumer
demand 2) resumed 5G deployment and Eagle steam platform upgrade
