UpDownside
Hikvision FY2Q22 results missed our consensus estimates on 1) COVID-19
resurgence in China 2) lower GPM and 3) higher RD Key highlights include
strong innovative overseas businesses growth (26% YoY 19% YoY
respectively) despite macro headwinds We expect gradual recovery in FY2H22E
with PBG EBG orders pick-up We revised down our target price to RMB4508
(prior RMB5710) to reflect lower margin and higher RD Hikvision is trading at
2-SD below three-year mean and we think the share price has already priced in
the heightened geopolitical risk Maintain BUY
 FY2Q22 weakness largely priced-in Hikvision delivered a weak yet largely
anticipated FY2Q22 results with revenue of RMB207bn (4% YoY) and net
profit of RMB35bn (-19% YoY) This is attributable to 1) COVID-19
resurgence in China 2) lower GPM (-33 pts YoY to 427%) given more low-
margin construction implementation work (GPM 175% in FY1H22 vs 290%
in FY1H21) and 3) higher RD of RMB26bn (19% YoY 26% QoQ)
 Expect gradual recovery in FY2H22E with continuous business
transformations Traditional surveillance business grew 68% YoY to
RMB303bn in FY1H22 largely driven by strong overseas sales of RMB97bn
(19% YoY) Business in China was affected by lockdowns in Mar-May
although Jun sales recovered slightly according to management We are
positive on continuous business transformations including 1) innovative
business segment delivered steady growth of 26% YoY to RMB7bn in
FY1H22 despite macro headwinds and 2) overseas business growth
momentum reflects Hikvision hardly-replicable advantages (ie technology
supply chain sales network etc) in global market
 Preparing for heightened geopolitical risk with increasing RD and high
inventory strategy Business recovery is still uneasy with rising geopolitical
risk and COVID-19 uncertainties in China Hikvision has maintained a high
inventory strategy (37% YoY) to minimize the impacts from supply chain
disruption Also Hikvision RD has reached a new level (RMB26bn in
FY2Q22 19% YoY) This will drive innovative business growth (smart home
robotics thermal etc) and hence better revenue mix in the long term
 Maintain BUY We revised down FY22-24E net profit by 3-7% to reflect lower
gross margin and higher RD Maintain BUY with new target price of
RMB4508 (prior RMB5710) Key downside risk includes new US sanction
