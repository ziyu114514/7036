UpDownside
Yonyou reported better than expected FY2Q22 with steady revenue growth of
15% YoY to RMB226bn Cloud revenue grew 57% YoY to RMB155bn
However we observed ARR contract liabilities growth have slowed to 2% 11%
HoH These may suggest a decline in renewal rate and add pressure to Yonyous
cloud subscription business Meanwhile Yonyou increased RD in cloud
platform YonBIP targeting large-sized enterprises RD was up 38% YoY as
well as RD capitalization rate We think earnings quality will be distorted during
the YonBIP ramp up phase Maintain HOLD
 FY2Q22 beat on lower opex ratio Yonyou delivered steady top-line growth
at 15% YoY to RMB2258mn beating our consensus estimates by 9%2%
Cloud revenue was RMB1551mn (57% YoY 107% QoQ) accounting for
69% of total Operating profit was RMB89mn (34% YoY) lower opex ratio at
573% (-27 pcts) has offset decline in GPM (-21 pcts YoY to 612%) Net
profit was RMB137mn (-40% YoY)
 ARR contract liabilities HoH growth slowdown adds uncertainty to
cloud outlook In FY1H22 Yonyou cloud revenue grew 53% YoY to
RMB2299mn In terms of customer mix 67 18% of cloud revenue came from
large-sized SME enterprises ARR was RMB1680mn (102% YoY 2%
HoH) Cloud contract liabilities was RMB1760mn (42% YoY 11% HoH)
These cloud metrics look good on a YoY basis but HoH growth rates slowed
These may suggest a decline in renewal rate and we are concerned that
Yonyous subscription revenue (mostly derived from SME) growth may slow
 Increasing RD (and capitalization rate) related to YonBIP platform for
large-size enterprises In FY1H22 Yonyou increased RD expenditure by
38% YoY to RMB132bn as the Company continues to develop cloud-native
YonBIP platform for large-sized enterprises RD capitalization rate also rose
to 264% (vs 219% in FY1H21) We think earnings quality will be distorted in
the short term during YonBIP ramp-up stage
 Maintain HOLD We raised FY22-24E net profit by 1-5% to reflect better than
expected opex control Maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB1981
(prior RMB1958) based on unchanged 50x FY23E EVsales

Yonyou (600588 CH HOLD TP RMB1981)
We maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB1981 (prior RMB1958) based on
unchanged 50x FY23E EVsales (40% discount to global enterprise SaaS person lower
subscription revenue contribution) Yonyou is trading at three-year low but we believe re-
rating would be difficult in the short term given that 80% of its cloud revenue is derived from
large-enterprises who are less willing to accept subscription model and require higher
customization work
