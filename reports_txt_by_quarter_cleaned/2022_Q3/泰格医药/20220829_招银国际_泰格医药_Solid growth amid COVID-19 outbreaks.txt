CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Tigermed (300347 CH)
Solid growth amid COVID-19 outbreaks
1H22 earnings beat Tigermed reported 1H22 revenue of RMB3594mn up
accounted for 51% of our full-year forecasts mainly attributable to the
continuous revenue contribution from COVID-19 related multi-regional clinical
trials (MRCTs) as well as solid growth from emerging business (including
medical registration scientific affairs medical translation real world studies
etc) and data management statistical analysis (DMSA) and other services
Excluding COVID-19 revenue 1H22 revenue increased by c45% YoY Gross
profit margin (GPM) deteriorated to 397% in 1H22 from 476% in 1H21 while
remained largely stable versus the 409% GPM in 2H21 GPM was understated
due to large proportion of pass-through revenue from COVID-19 projects
Considering the shrinking size of COVID-19 related revenue we expect
Tigermeds GPM to recover in 2H22E During 1H22 non-COVID-19 related new
orders increased by c37% YoY indicating sustainable growth of core business
 Solid growth despite negative impact from COVID-19 outbreaks in
1H22 Leveraging its nationwide clinical network Tigermed was able to
largely mitigate business disruptions caused by COVID-19 outbreak in
China especially in Shanghai and Jinlin As a result the Company delivered
continuous growth in the number of ongoing clinical trials As of Jun 2022
Tigermed operated 607 ongoing drug clinical trials (vs 567 as of Dec 2021)
including 400 single-region clinical trials conducted in China (vs 385 as of
Dec 2021) and 58 MRCTs (vs 50 as of Dec 2021) In addition emerging
businesses (including medical registration scientific affairs medical
translation real world studies etc) continued strong growth driven by solid
demand demonstrating Tigermeds enhanced integrated capabilities
 Human resources allocation focusing on high-margin business and
overseas expansion Tigermed proactively reduced the team size of the
low-margin site management organization (SMO) services to 2503 staff as
of Jun 2022 from 2700 as of Dec 2021 However employee hirings for
other business remained active especially for its overseas business
Tigermed expanded its overseas team size to 1151 staff as of Jun 2022
from 1026 as of Dec 2021 We expect the Company to further enhance its
overseas service capabilities via MAs

on a 10-year DCF model (WACC 984% terminal growth rate 30%) We
