公司业绩有所承压。2022Q1-3 收入9386 亿元，同比104%，归母

05%。其中2022Q3，收入3040 亿元，同比67%，归母净利193
亿元，同比-265%，扣非归母净利169 亿元，同比-333%。
液态奶压力较大，婴配粉持续增长。2022Q1-3 分产品收入：液态
奶奶粉及奶制品冷饮产品实现营收64101873920 亿元，同比
-10%605%324%。其中22Q3 液态奶奶粉及奶制品冷饮产品
实现营收2121666191 亿元，同比-49%647%353%。液态
奶板块Q3 录得负增长，主因疫情散发使得部分消费场景缺失，同
时消费信心和消费力不足。
毛利率较稳定，费用高于预期。2022Q1-3 毛利率为328%，同比
14pct，受益于公司主动控制促销、稳定价盘及产品结构升级。
归母净利率为86%，同比-08pct。2022Q1-3 销售管理费用率分别

要因液态奶收入下滑超预期而费用规划较刚性、以及费用确认时
点影响及澳优并表影响。
明年费用将有所控制，业务结构持续优化。展望Q4，液态奶业务
有望恢复个位数增长，根据国家统计局数据，9月乳制品产量同比
增长58%，同时今年春节备货提前将有所催化，我们对液态奶Q4
保持乐观，预计四季度液态奶将探底回升。奶粉Q4 将维持高于
20%的内生增速。展望2023 年，我们重申液态奶竞争拐点已现的
观点。考虑到行业整体经营较为承压，公司23 年销售费用将合理
控制。同时随着消费力恢复，液态奶将重回高端化趋势。奶粉行
业2023 年将有所回暖，新国标后价格竞争有望趋缓，公司有望持
续取得市场份额。我们预计明年营业收入仍将保持高双位数增
长，同时明年利润在低基数基础上增速将约17%。
盈利预测与投资建议：考虑疫情情况、液奶恢复不及预期，下调
盈利预测，我们预计公司2022-2024 年营业收入分别为12296、
16609 亿元），同比增长112%、132%、109%；归母净利润为
1451 亿元），同比增长91%、169%、151%；EPS 分别为148、
173、200 元（前值22-24 年预测为161199227 元）。考虑到
液态奶竞争拐点已现，费用将有所控制；同时业务结构变化背景
下，高毛利业务占比提升，预期未来公司利润率逐步提升，参考
可比公司估值，我们给予公司2023 年25xPE（不变），目标价为
434 元，维持优于大市评级。
风险提示：疫情不确定性、食品安全问题、新品推广不及预期。
