CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Tigermed (300347 CH)
Core business growth remains solid
3Q22 earnings in line Tigermed reported 3Q22 revenue of RMB1812mn up
19 revenue we estimate 3Q22 revenue increased by c42% YoY The declining
margin (GPM) continuously improved to 409% in 3Q22 from 388% in 1Q22 and
406% in 2Q22 thanks to the shrinking size of the low-margin COVID-19 related
revenue (due to pass-through revenue to sub-contractors in overseas markets)
as well as the growth of US-denominated services such as data management
and statistical analysis (DMSA) and laboratory services provided by Frontage
which benefited from US appreciation in 3Q22 Non-COVID-19 related new
orders increased by c35%30% YoY in 9M223Q22 respectively indicating
sustainable growth of core business
 Consistently focus on high-margin business Management has prioritized
the expansion of high-margin businesses including clinical trials operation
DMSA and some emerging services while takes a relatively conservative
strategy on the SMO business given its low profitability nature According to
management the Company has further increased its market share in China
clinical CRO market for innovative drugs to c20% in 3Q22 which
recognition DMSA successfully sealed a strategic cooperation deal with a
global Top10 pharma in the past quarter Additionally Tigermed has adopted
a proactive hiring strategy and allocated more human resources to high
margin business in 3Q22 We think the strategic change is critical and
necessary for Tigermed to further enhance its leading position for its core
 Globalization on track Tigermed has built local BD teams to explore
business opportunities in Europe and the US  The Company has participated
in large-scale Phase III multi-regional clinical trials (MRCT) in multiple middle
and western European countries The Company also took full advantages of
its experiences in COVID-19 vaccine projects of Chinese clients to expand
business opportunities in developing countries including Indonesia Brazil
Chile and Pakistan These developing countries could be potential markets
for Chinese drug makers which will create additional demand for Tigermeds
clinical CRO services
