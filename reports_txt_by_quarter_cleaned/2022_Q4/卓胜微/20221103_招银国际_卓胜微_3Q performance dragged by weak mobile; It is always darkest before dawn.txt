Maxscend announced its 3Q22 results 3Q revenue declined 305% YoY and
136% QoQ to RMB782mn NP to shareholders fell 546% YoY and 205% QoQ
to RMB233mn The decline was mainly attributable to the weak mobile market
3Q GPM increased slightly to 541% (vs 524%527% for 1Q2Q22) We lowered
our forecasts for 202223E sales by 25%30% due to both tough macro
environment and prolonged weakness observed in mobile particularly in Android
names However considering a series of solid progress achieved from internal
RD (eg SAW filter Diplexer DiFEM etc) we expect the Company will
continue to roll out products in new categories that are dominated by overseas
names We maintain a positive outlook for Maxscend given its leading position
in domestic RFFE market and proven track record of its management team
Maintain BUY with revised TP of RMB1078 reflecting reducing 2223E sales
 Industry headwind may provide an opportunity for Maxscend Despite
mobile weakness Maxscends 3Q results were resilient The Company
reported GPM of 541% (up 13% from 2Q) showing its relatively strong
position in a broad weak market GPM is estimated to drop 2% in 2023 due to
increasing yield of new products but will remain stable at 50% much higher
than its peers (figure 3) The high GPM will help Maxscend to maintain its
leading position in domestic RFFE market by continuously investing in RD
(3Q RD exp grew 551% YoY) Meanwhile some smaller peers are
struggling to survive We believe Maxscend will be a beneficiary of a potential
sector consolidation following the same path of its global peers (eg
Skyworks and Qorvo)
 Maxscends product portfolio expansion is on schedule Maxscends new
fab line has entered mass production The Companys own filter products
have been shipped Meanwhile diplexer and multiplexers are under client
testing We expect the Company to deliver more progress on high-end filter
and integrated modules next year Although the recent US export curb has
no impact on RFFE sector Chinas semi localization trend is certain This will
create more opportunities for domestic players
 Maintain BUY with TP revised up to RMB1078 The new TP is based on
36x rollover 23E PE lower than 1SD below 2-yr hist avg of 436x forward
PE We kept the valuation of 36x PE unchanged as we believe 1) semi
localization trend is certain and 2) Maxscend is venturing into some key RFFE
 Potential risks include 1) disappointing demand in mobile 2) intensified
macro environment Potential upside includes MA opportunities
