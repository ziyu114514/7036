SANY Heavy Industry (600031
CH) - 2021 results Big miss on
a surprising net loss in 4Q21
Yet to see meaningful recovery

SANYs 3Q22 net profit declined 61% YoY to RMB963mn with earnings largely
along with the increased distribution expense and RD spending are the key
factors that dragged the earnings We slash our 2022E23E24E earnings
forecast by 52%38%36% (37%-44% below consensus) largely a result of lower
sales volume and higher expense assumptions We cut our TP to RMB147
based on 28x 2022E PE (average since the upcycle starting from 2017  1SD)
Our above average target multiple is to reflect potential earnings recovery in
2023E driven by low earnings base and oversea market Maintain HOLD due to
the lack of upside potential
 Key highlights in 3Q22 results Revenue dropped 8% YoY to RMB19bn
Gross margin slightly improved 06ppt QoQ but still dropped 11ppt YoY to
238% Selling  distribution expense ratio increased 29ppt YoY to 84%
while RD expense ratio also increased 2ppt YoY to 84% All these drove the
EBIT down 91% YoY to only RMB158mn Net profit declined 61% YoY to
gains Operating cash inflow increased 12% YoY to RMB500mn In 9M22
revenue  net profit dropped 33%71% YoY to RMB36bn
 Overseas accounted for 46% of total revenue in 3Q22 We calculate that
the overseas revenue in 3Q22 surged 68% YoY to RMB93bn driven largely
by excavators (89% YoY 49% of total overseas revenue) In 9M22 overseas
revenue grew 44% YoY to RMB259bn We believe overseas market will
continue to serve as a key growth engine that offsets the weakness in China
 Bear case scenario 15x PB We still value SANY with earnings multiple at
present That said we think market will potentially switch to asset-based
valuation if the downcycle continues We see 15x forward PB (equivalent to
RMB114 21% downside) a key supporting level in the previous trough cycle
 Upside risk (1) stabilization of property investment Downside risks (1)
further weakness in construction activities (2) slowdown of overseas demand
