Youyou reported in-line revenue growth of 17% YoY to RMB206bn in FY3Q22
However net loss widened unexpectedly to RMB284mn mainly due to margin
erosion Yonyou delivered slowest cloud revenue growth of 22% YoY since the
software business from large-sized enterprises was up 19% YoY This could
imply large-sized enterprises are less willing to adopt cloud model and increasing
customization may drag Yonyous margin further Maintain HOLD
 FY3Q22 miss on margin Yonyou delivered in-line revenue growth of 17%
YoY to RMB2059mn Net loss widened to RMB284mn (vs -RMB88mn in
3Q21) mainly dragged by 1) GPM erosion (-82 ppts YoY to 499%) and 2)
higher opex (22% YoY to RMB1394mn) Company attributed the bottom-
line miss to the strategic expansion in salesRD workforce given increasing
software localization demand Yonyou has 25276 staff (23% YoY) in 3Q22
However we observed that revenue generated per employee has declined for
6 consecutive quarters
 Revenue mix change suggest uncertainty in cloud migration strategy
Yonyou delivered the slowest cloud revenue growth of 22% YoY to
cloud-focus strategy in 2019 Meanwhile revenue from Software recorded
unexpected YoY growth of 15% YoY to RMB795mn (was in declining trend
since 2019) as revenue from large-sized enterprise was up 19% YoY Cloud
revenue contribution thus dropped to 61% in 3Q22 (vs 69% in 2Q22) This
could imply large-sized enterprises are unwilling to adopt cloud model
 Software localization demand from SOEs benefits top-line but not
margin In FY3Q22 Yonyou recorded -82 ppts YoY in GPM We believe
Xinchuang demand from large-sized enterprises (mostly SOEs) will benefit
Yonyous top line growth However as these SOEs have higher requirement
in software customization a continue change in revenue mix will likely drag
Yonyous margin further According to management 95% of the sizable orders
came from SOEs in 3Q22
 Maintain HOLD We cut FY2223E net profit by 2213% mainly to reflect a
lower margin Maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB2351 (prior
RMB1981) based on higher 60x (prior 50x) FY23E EVsales We raised our
target multiple considering the software localization trend and hence demand
for Yonyous ERP is solidified after the 20th Party Congress
