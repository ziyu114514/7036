Sanyas lockdown weighed on CTGDFs 3Q results as we expected
with recurring net profits standing at RMB656mn down 45% as we
exclude non-core Beijing airport rental concession and Hainan tax cut impact
Despite this revenue of the quarter rose 8% QoQ to RMB117bn when
online sales with Sunrise Shanghai made up most of the offline hiccups The
change in sales mix also led to an almost 10pp11pp QoQ decline in GPM
OPM to 247% 125% respectively
Key takeaways from management calls
1) Forex impact management has taken a few initiatives to mitigate the
adverse impact from a strengthening USD (against RMB) This includes
enriching forex reserves extending payments (dominated in foreign
currencies) and cost sharing with suppliers
2) Synergy with Swire Property A piece of land was jointly acquired for the
expansion of Haitang Bay Phase 1 and both CTGDF and Swire will work
out the expansion of Haitang Bay Phase 23 together
3) The opening of the Haikou DFS mall on 28 Oct with a total of 280k sq m
the mall covers 800 global luxury brands and 25 of them including YSL
Prada Burberry BV Moncler etc had their first footstep in Hainan On the
other hand according to our survey customer could enjoy 20% for every 2
cosmetic items purchased For other popular brands like Shisedo La Mer
Dior discount ranges from 28-32% off MSRP
Earnings change To reflect the 3Q results we cut our 202223E revenue
by 166% 238% GPM by 1609pp leading to an average 23% cut in net
profits for the periods Our current forecast implies 4Q22E revenue net
profits to be RMB177bn22bn with a 37% GPM barring any unexpected
lockdown for the quarter For now we assume Hainan will generate
RMB54bn75bn sales from duty-free operators (DF plus non-DF) in 202223
and CTGDF will share 80%77% of it
Valuation Our revised TP is based on an unchanged 450x roll-forward
end-23E PE which still represents 2-year average since 2020
