Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic  Recovery
weaker-than-expected Rich valuation
along with earnings risk  10 Feb
SHSZ300  (rebased)
Henglis reported net profit in 3Q22 grew 20% YoY driven by FX gain due to the
from FX gain) dropped 9% YoY in 3Q22 While the 4% YoY revenue growth (vs
-25% YoY in 1H22) is an early sign of recovery its still slightly below our
expectation We revise down our 2022E23E earnings forecast by 9%8% to
reflect more conservative assumptions on sales volume We trim our TP to
RMB58 accordingly based on unchanged 30x 2022E PE (equivalent to 3-year
historical average) Maintain HOLD We believe we are close to the inflection
point but are waiting for more data points to confirm the recovery of excavator
 3Q22 earnings highlights Revenue grew 4% YoY to RMB2bn which we
estimate was driven by the strong sales to the major US customer Gross
margin narrowed 21ppt YoY but expanded 17ppt QoQ EBIT slightly dropped
16% YoY to RMB576mn Its worth noting that Hengli recognized net finance
dollar-denominated assets This boosted the reported net profit by 20% YoY
to RMB692mn Operating cash inflow dropped 59% YoY to RMB377mn in
3Q22 In 9M22 the reported net profit dropped 11% YoY to RMB175bnn
 Production plan in Oct 2022 Hengli has scheduled production volume of
56k units of hydraulic cylinder (excavator) down 15% YoY Scheduled
production volume of small medium-large size pump drops 50% YoY as a
result of the continuous inventory clearance that affected the output Planned
volume of motor (mainly for AWP) drops 15% YoY On the positive side the
planned production for non-standardized cylinders in Oct grows 7% YoY to
16k units
 Early signs of recovery for the excavator industry For the industry as a
whole we have started to see some early positive signs (1) strong export will
likely exceed expectation on the back of overseas mining activities (2)
back of the very low base and continuous policy easing (3) major cost items
such as steel plate and freight rate are on the down trend offering upside
potential on the margin side
 Upside risk (1) Strong recovery of excavator demand in China Downside
risks (1) weak construction activities (2) risk of overseas demand
