Willsemi announced its 3Q22 results 3Q revenue declined 265% YoY and 221%
QoQ to RMB43bn NP to shareholders recorded a net loss of RMB120mn a hard
hit from smartphone market weakness and slow digestion of CIS inventory GPM
dropped to 284% in 3Q (vs 333%345% in 2Q22 and 2021) Although we had
expected a weak 3Q performance and revised down our forecast pre-earnings
announcement (link) 3Q results came in much lower than our estimates We
think the near-term weakness may last longer We downgrade Willsemi to
HOLD and cut TP to RMB7818
 3Q22 results were lower than estimates and NP to shareholder recorded
a net loss  Although weak 3Q results had been widely expected the numbers
were much lower than estimates Sales declined 221% QoQ in 3Q which
was usually the best quarter of a year The decline was due to disappointing
Android smartphone shipment which resulted in slow destocking of handset
 Inventory increased another quarter by 116% QoQ and 966% YoY to
RMB14bn in 3Q which equaled to almost 10 months of sales at current run
de-stocking process is improving we expect it might take longer (normal
level 4x monthly sales) than market currently expects any de-stocking
pace stagnation would cause downward pressure on stock In addition
high level of inventory may increase the possibility of a potential write-off in
near future
 Downgrade to HOLD and lower TP to RMB7818 We lower bottom line
forecasts for 202223E by 29% and 27% We downgrade Willsemi to HOLD
as we expect the near-term pressures (demand weakness ASP pressure
market sentiment etc) may take longer than expected to improve The
new TP is based on 293x 2023E PE (vs prev 32x) 10 PEG and close to
domestic peers avg (289x) Potential upsides include 1) faster-than-
expected CIS de-stocking 2) Android smartphone shipment recovery
