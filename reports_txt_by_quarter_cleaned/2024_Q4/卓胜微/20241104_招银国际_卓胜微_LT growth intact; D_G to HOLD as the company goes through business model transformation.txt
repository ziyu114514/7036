CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Maxscend (300782 CH)
goes through business model transformation
Maxscend released its 3Q24 results Revenue declined by 23% YoY1% QoQ
to RMB11bn driven by a weaker seasonality as smartphone demand is not
showing strong recovery NP declined by 84% YoY55% QoQ to RMB71mn
mainly due to GPM erosion (down 43ppts sequentially to 371%) on 1) fab
ramp-up 2) an unfavorable product mix towards higher module shipments and
3) USDRMB FX impacts NPM dropped to 66% from 143%321% in
2Q243Q23 on lower GPM higher RD costs (up 66% YoY) and asset
impairment loss Although Maxscends LT growth prospects remain intact we
downgrade the stock to HOLD on ST pain from business transformation
(fabless to fab-lite) that weighs on profitability TP adjusted to RMB86
corresponding to 45x 2025E PE (vs 445x before)
 Unlike a usual peak season in 3Q (40% QoQ growth pre-pandemic in
3Q1819 and 48% QoQ in 3Q23) quarterly sales were flattish
sequentially (-1%) showing a weak market demand Although we have
expected weakness would be a drag to 3Q24 sales top-line growth was still
below ourBBG consensus by 21%24% Therefore we revise down our
202425E revenue forecasts by 8%7% with FY2425E revenue growth
adjusted to 47%23% YoY
 Module business to be the key driver of future growth In 9M24
Maxscend saw module revenue contribution increase (43% est of sales vs
36% in 2023) to RMB14bn We expect module share to increase further
to 49%55% in 202425E as we believe modulization in RFFE industry has
 GPM is expected to recover to 40% in 2H25 We expect margin to face
ongoing challenges in the next 2-3 quarters due to capacity ramp-up at
Xinzhuo and utilization not yet achieving the optimized level (slow recovery
in demand) The margin headwind may persist at least into 1H25 as the
(est RMB137mn depreciation in 4Q24E and a total of RMB550mn in 2024E
per mgmt) We cut GPM estimates by 19ppt11ppt for 202425E
 Downgrade to HOLD with adj TP at RMB86 based on 45x 2025E PE
(close to peers avg of 41x 2025E PE) We believe Maxscend must
endure the trials of transformative business model shift through challenges
before shining bright again on the global stage Key upside risks 1) faster-
than-expected recovery in demand and share expansions and 2)
depreciations less severe impacts on margins key downside risks 1)
slower-than-expected capacity ramp-up 2) weak recovery in demand and
3) escalating geopolitical tensions
