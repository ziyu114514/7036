Naura Technology (002371 CH)
Solid Q3 earnings signal intact growth trajectory
Naura announced 3Q24 results Q3 revenue was RMB80bn up 301% YoY
and 238% QoQ driven by significant growth in semiconductor equipment sales
(up 470% in 9M24) NP was RMB17bn up 550% YoY and 17% QoQ GPM
was 423% up 59ppts from 3Q23 but declined 51ppts sequentially mainly due
to 1) higher photovoltaic (PV) equipment sales that had a lower GPM and 2)
seasonal fluctuations in gross margins of semiconductor equipment business
Overall Q3 was a solid quarter with robust revenue and net profit growth

PE (vs prev 358x)
 9M24 results showed Naura is on track with stellar growth 9M24
revenue grew 395% YoY benefiting from continuously strong sales of
domestic semiconductor equipment (up 470% YoY in 9M24) due to Chinas
semi localization trend 2025E bookings remain a key focus for most
investors but have not been announced yet (2024 bookings were
announced in Jan 2024) We maintain our sales growth forecasts for
202425E at 397%265% YoY
 Margin decreased 51ppts QoQ in 3Q24 a similar seasonality observed
in 3Q23 (down 70ppts) in addition to a negative impact from increased PV
equipment sales We revise down our 202425E GPM forecast by
13ppts11ppts to reflect the seasonality trend in 202425E but we expect
GPM to continue its upward trend (437%443%) in 202425E on a
favourable product mix We slightly lower our NP forecasts by 3%4% in
2425E considering continued investments in RD
 Maintain BUY with TP adjusted to RMB426 based on 30x rollover
2025E PE close to its historical 2-year forward PE New TP also reflects
10x PEG Potential risks include 1) worsening China-US trade relations 2)
heightened geopolitical tensions 3) slower-than-expected RD
