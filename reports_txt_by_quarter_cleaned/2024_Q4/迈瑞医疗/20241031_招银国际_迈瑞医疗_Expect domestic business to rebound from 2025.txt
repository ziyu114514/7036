CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Mindray (300760 CH)
Expect domestic business to rebound from
Mindray reported 9M24 revenue of RMB295bn up by 80% YoY Attributable net
profit increased by 82% YoY to RMB106bn Revenue in 3Q24 grew by 14%
YoY to RMB90bn while attributable net profit decreased by 93% YoY to
RMB31bn The slowdown in revenue growth can primarily be attributed to
lackluster procurement activities in domestic public hospitals and weakened
demand for IVD testing particularly in lower-tier hospitals Consequently
Mindrays domestic revenue fell by 97% YoY in 3Q24 Additionally GPM in 3Q24
decreased by 48pcts QoQ due to updates in accounting guidelines
 Domestic market remained under pressure although signs of recovery
in procurement are emerging 1) IVD Domestic revenue grew by 17% YoY
in 9M24 Nationwide DRG implementation had a negative impact on the
diagnosis demand in lower-tier hospitals which were the main contributors to
Mindrays domestic IVD revenue To counter act this Mindray actively
expanded its IVD business into top hospitals through its TLA and IT solutions
We expect Mindray to install over 150 TLAs in 2024E 2) MIS Domestic
revenue grew by over 10% YoY in 9M24 driven by the strong volume ramp-
up of ultra-high-end Resona A20 ultrasound system 3) PMLS Domestic
revenue decreased by 28% YoY in 9M24 The decline was influenced by
environment However with accelerated issuance of special bonds and
stronger government support to address local debt issues we expect
domestic equipment demand to recover in 2025E
 Healthy growth in overseas business In 3Q24 Mindrays overseas
revenue increased by 186% YoY with strong performances in Europe (29%
YoY) APAC (32% YoY) and LatAm (25% YoY) although there was some
weakness in the US market Driven by breakthroughs in medium-to-large
volume labs Mindrays overseas IVD revenue increased by 32% YoY in
9M24 accounting for 28% of total overseas revenue Mindray has
accelerated its overseas localization efforts As of 3Q24 Mindray launched
local manufacturing in 9 countries 8 of which are related to IVD Additionally
emerging businesses such as minimally invasive surgery (50% YoY) AED
(50% YoY) and animal medical (30% YoY) grew significantly in 9M24
These emerging businesses contributed over 10% to Mindrays overseas
