Shengyi Tech (600183 CH)
PCB outperformed CCL in 3Q margin improved
Shengyi Tech announced 3Q24 results Revenue was RMB51bn up 145%
YoY but down 17% QoQ in-line with Bloomberg consensus GPM was 229%
up 11ppts from 2Q24 benefitting from favourable product mix and lowered
material costs NP was RMB440mn up 278% YoY but down 186% QoQ NPM
lowered to 86% (vs 104% in 2Q24) Bottom line missed Bloomberg consensus
by 26% mainly due to SBC cost of RMB150mn (29% of revenue) Looking
forward we expect Shengyis revenue to grow at 20%16% YoY in 202425E
with improved margin at 221%236% Maintain BUY with adjusted TP at
RMB2875 (vs prev RMB2641) reflecting rollover 255x 2025E PE which
is closed to its 3-yr historical forward PE
 PCB sales grew on strong AI demand GPM recovered both YoY and
QoQ 3Q24 PCB revenue was RMB12bn up 493% YoY and 108% QoQ
The growth was mainly driven by a significant rise (209% YoY in 9M24) in
server revenue (425% of PCB sales) Overseas market outperformed with
321% YoY sales increase GPM recovered to 249% from 204%142% in
3Q232Q24 mainly on favourable revenue mix NPM rose to 75% vs -
34%64% in 3Q232Q24 We raise our projection for PCB sales by 5%1%
for 202425E on quicker-than-expected ramp-up of related products for AI
server market We expect the segment to grow at 35%20% in 202425E
 CCL revenue was up YoY but down QoQ (est 5-6% lower) likely on
weaker-than-expected demand in non-AI market which suppresses ASP
recovery Margin slid sequentially as copper price remained at its highs
(avg price in 3Q24 US99kt) But Shengyi managed to offset partial
impact of material cost headwinds with pre-procurement activities
However this led to an 8% QoQ increase (RMB365mn) in inventory We cut
our forecasts for CCL sales by 8%6% for 202425E on slower-than-
expected market recovery We expect the segment to grow at 14%15% in
 Maintain BUY with adjusted TP at RMB2875 We slightly revised down
our salesNP estimates by 4%6% for 2025E New TP is based on 255x
rollover 2025E PE which is close to its 3-yr historical forward PE Potential
risks include copper price volatility and weaker-than-expected demand
