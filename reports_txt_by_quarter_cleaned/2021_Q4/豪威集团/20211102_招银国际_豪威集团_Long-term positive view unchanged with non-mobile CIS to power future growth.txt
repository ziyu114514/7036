Willsemi released 3Q21 results RevNP of RMB59bn13bn (-10%731% YoY)
largely in-line with preannouncement of net profit earlier due to weak smartphone
sales and supply chain constraints Considering underlying negative factors
which would last longer we revised down our FY21E-23E rev forecasts but
raised margin est due to improved product mix We remain positive on Willsemi
and believe its non-mobile CIS business will maintain strong momentum and
adjusted to RMB3466 given expected weak performance in global smartphone
sales and fast growth seen in non-mobile CIS business
 3Q mobile CIS business was challenging new products will help gain
market share in FY22E 3Q global smartphone shipment declined by 6% YoY
Stronger sales were observed in mid- to high-end models (evidenced by
recovering Sonys CIS sales in 3Q) Although we hold a neutral view on
smartphone market growth into 2022 especially for non-Apple brands we
believe Willsemi can still gain share (in RMB1k-2k and RMB3k models) with
its new 50MP100MP200MP products
 GPM improved to 355% as non-mobile CIS accounted for 50% of 3Q CIS
sales Non-mobile CIS continued lifting Companys profitability GPM
improved to 355% (vs 299%337% in 20202Q21) We believe the trend is
sustainable with rapid growth in auto ARVR segments We are positive on
Willsemis auto CIS business considering the growth from both surging market
demand and increasing market share Auto CIS market is experiencing a
similar path of smartphone with higher ASPquantity Willsemi is closing its
market share gap with On semi We expect to see continuous strong growth
in its auto CIS business despite the prolonged chip shortage issue
 Maintain BUY rating with revised TP of RMB3466 based on 50x FY22E
PE We cut our FY21E-23E revenue forecast by 8%-16% considering weak
estimates of global smartphone sales and prolonged supply chain constraints
Meanwhile we raised our margin estimates by 1pt-13pt due to improved
product mix Potential upsides include 1) faster-than-expected ease of supply
chain constraints 2) new devicekiller app released in VRAR Potential risks
include 1) worse-than-expected global economy that curbs consumer
spending and 2) overhung chip shortage led to unfilled demand

CIS non-mobile CIS will maintain strong momemtum while
smartphone market is weak
Weak smartphone sales in FY21E expect modest mobile CIS growth
Full year smartphone shipment forecast has been cut to 141bn units (6% YoY) from
previous 145bn units (9%) according to Counterpoint The shipment rebounded in 3Q20
after the logistic resumed from COVID-19 disruption but was negatively affected again in
2Q21 due to semiconductor shortage The situation got worse in 3Q21 before peak season
Canalyss estimated global smartphone shipment for the third quarter was a 6% YoY
Looking forward we expect Q4 shipment will have some sequential recovery during the
holidays However we do not expect the rebound will be significant given 1) continued
(the discount this year will not be aggressive as Apple did not raise the price of its new 13

Figure 5 Market concerns over sluggish smartphone
shipment and lower No of cameras used per
smartphone (289 latest models of top brands)
Source Counterpoint nanoreview kimovil devicespecifications and
 Samsung Xiaomi Oppo vivo Honor (1Q20 to 3Q21)
Given the recent weak smartphone sales the market is conservative in mobile CIS market
growth given that 1) the constraints of smartphone sales will not ease in near-term (such
as semi shortage power shortage rising foundry costs etc) 2) the mobile camera
shipment was sluggish since 2Q21 driven by slower penetration of triple-quad-cameras in
latest models of smartphones and 3) the de-spec concern
We have studied 289 latest models (released from 1Q20-3Q21) from the top Andriod
brands including Samsung Xiaomi Oppo vivo Honor we did see the trend of slowing
down penetration of multi-cameras We think the main reason is the increasing bill of
materials (BOM) that put a lot of pressure on smartphone makers It is a mixed result from
1) smartphone upgrade (rising cost due to additional frequency coverage better camera
resolution larger storage etc) 2) tight supply chain and 3) peers pressure such as new
pricing strategy of Apple series 13
These headwinds are likely to continue into 1H22E Although we hold a neutral view on
smartphone market growth into 2022 especially for non-Apple brands we believe Willsemi

can still gain share (in RMB1k-2k and RMB3k models) with its new 50MP100MP200MP
products The Company is deeply engaged with Chinese mobile manufacturers and will
ride the tailwind of their market expansions (OppovivoHonor) We saw the Companys
mobile CIS products has penetrated into rear main cameras since last year Based on the
study of 289 latest models we found their CIS products in certain XiaomiOppoHuaweis
models One interesting thing to note is that these models released in 2021 are mostly mid-
budget and mid-ranged models) The spec has also increased to 48MP50MP64MP this
year (vs 13MP16MP48MP in 2020) We believe the penetration will continue given the
uncertainty of Sino-US trade tension and Willsemis leading market position in CIS and
advanced technology
Auto market is also affected by chip shortage but we hold positive
view on auto CIS market growth as the demand is certain
Although IHS Markit has cut their forecasts for 2021E-23E light vehicle production by
62%93%11% the growth for 22E23E will still be 93%114% YoY driven by strong
demand for auto cameras (such as ADAS) We are very positive on auto CIS market growth
as it is likely to replicate the path of mobile CIS with higher ASP and larger number of
cameras per vehicle
We think Willsemi will be a key beneficiary of auto CIS growth The Company currently
provides CIS for European auto manufacturers and eyes on expansion in US market
Willsemi has also worked closely with ADAS developers such as Mobileye The
certification for auto-related production (eg IATF 16949) will take longer time to obtain and
the requirements will be much stricter Willsemi ranked as No2 among auto CIS suppliers
but is closing its market share gap with On semi We expect to see continuous strong
growth in its auto CIS business despite the prolonged chip shortage issue

We are still positive on Willsemi For mobile CIS the Company is currently a leading
supplier for main rear cameras in certain models (RMB1k and RMB2k-3k) Although we
hold a neutral view on smartphone market growth into 2022 especially for non-Apple
