BUY (Maintain)
(Previous TP            RMB 3190)
UpDownside
Shengyi Tech released 3Q21 results with revenue of RMB55bn (455% YoY)
and net profit of RMB925mn (939% YoY) largely in-line with its preannounced
earnings earlier We believe Shengyis solid results confirmed the strong demand
for both CCL (566% YoY) and PCB (268% QoQ) However 3Q gross margin
was down vs 1H21 suggesting difficulty in further transferring the material cost
pressure to downstream clients We revised up FY21-22E EPS by 6-16% but
slightly adjusted TP to RMB3050 with lower target multiple (225x vs previous
25x FY22E PE) Maintain BUY
 Positive outlook for FY21E-22E CCL sales supported by strong demand
cost pressure may challenge GPM ahead Due to pent-up demand for CCL
from several end markets (auto consumer etc) Shengyi reported strong
sales during 9M21 Revenue grew at 598% YoY however GPM reduced to
26% in 3Q21 (vs 293% in 1H21) The results are largely in line with our
previous view of another strong quarter in Q3 but uncertainty is rising given
limited room for CCL suppliers to increase ASP (Link) We think the
Company had less ASP adjustment in Q3 although material cost continued
to rise (LME 3M copper price rebounded to US10kton last week) Looking
forward we believe momentum for CCL will continue on strong demand
However short-term uncertainty still exists such as cost pressure and further
power shortage
 PCB segment started to recover with improved GPM We saw its PCB
segment recovered in 3Q21 with 268% QoQ revenue growth Major reasons
include 1) 5G deployment resumed in 3Q21 and 2) contribution from new
capacity in Jian factory (37k sq mmonth) PCB GPM has also increased to
213% (vs 160% in Q2) but still negatively affected by high material price
will continue to recover but high cost pressure will remain as an overhang
 Maintain BUY and slightly adjusted TP to RMB3050 Our new TP of
RMB3050 is based on lowered 225x FY22 PE (vs previous 25x due to
limited CCL ASP upside) Although GPM may face continuous challenge we
saw net margin was steadily improving Trading at 166x FY22E PE the
stock remains attractive Potential risks include less-than-expected transfer
of material costs and less-than-expected market demand

Sector outlook remains positive despite short-term power
Prismark raised 2021E full-year growth forecast for PCB industry again to 182%
(86%140% in 4Q201Q21) driven by the widespread economic recovery as the
pandemic is controlled and there is strong consumer demand They believe Japan and
China will outperform their global peers

In 1H21 Shengyi Tech has experienced fast growth in its CCL business (a key material of
PCB) due to the pent-up demand from consumer and auto market Meanwhile given that
material prices (especially the copper) remain at their highs the ASP of Shengyis CCL
products has increased 30% in 1H21 successfully transferred the material price to
downstream PCB manufacturer However its PCB segment has a much weaker
performance due to the delayed 5G deployment this year The ASP has dropped as the

Source Company data CMBIS estimates
We expect material prices to remain at their highs in near-term given that 1) recovery of
global economy will continue 2) low copper inventory in China and 3) government
intervention (suppressing market price from its equilibrium) which increases buyers
intention to stock up material inventories but curbs suppliers willingness to sell

There were several waves of material price increase in 1H21 to reflect the rising costs
Shengyis CCL price has increased 30% in 1H21 The room for further price rise will be
less For 2H21 the market is conservative given concerns of 1) sluggish consumer growth
2) uncertainty in macroeconomic environment 3) reducing demand in low margin market
suppressed by high material price and 4) potential impact from power shortage starting
from late 3Q21
Currently Shengyis CCL capacity is about 680-700w sq m per month Due to the high
order volume in 1H21 the capacity utilization is very full in certain months The auto market
has the longest order visibility (60-90 days) New CCL capacity includes 1) 11mn sq m in
Changsu Jiangsu (expected to begin production in SeptOct 2022) 2) 26mn sq m in
Dongguan Guangdong (expected to begin production in SeptOct 2022) and 3) 74mn sq
m in Shanxi (expected to begin production in 1Q22) New PCB capacity includes 35w sq
m in Dongguan Guangdong (expected to begin production in 2H22)

Overall we are still positive in Shengyis future performance As the second largest CCL
provider in the world we believe the Company is capable to adjust its product structure to
1) transfer the material cost better than its peers and 2) maintain its capacity utilization at
high level
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
However near-term uncertainty still exists Currently the power shortage has limited impact
as material prices are still at their highs continuous cost pressure may challenge the
Companys GPM ahead

Maintain BUY with new TP at RMB3050 (36% upside)
We maintain BUY rating with TP of RMB3050 based on the trimmed 225x FY22E PE
We lowered the valuation given that the transfer of cost pressure slowed down in 3Q21 but
material prices especially copper are still at their highs We expect the momentum will
continue and PCB business will steadily recover but near-term cost pressure will remain
as the biggest overhang
Potential risks include less-than-expected transfer of material costs and less-than-expected
market demand
