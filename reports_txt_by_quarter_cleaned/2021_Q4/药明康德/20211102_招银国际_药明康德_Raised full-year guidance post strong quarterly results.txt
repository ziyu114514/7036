project number reached 1548 (36% YoY) including 47 in Phase 3 projects
that the Company now has 77 oligo  peptide drug CDMO projects (97%

in 2021 For clinical CRO revenue increased by 33% YoY to RMB419mn in
3Q21 (up 47% YoY in 9M21) Clinical CRO business has experienced a

CDMO services for 61 CGT projects including 10 projects in Phase 3 stage

YoY which is backed by the solid growth in 9M21 as well as the foreseeable
solid customer demand In addition Management indicated that COVID-19
projects contributed a limited portion of its total revenue in 9M21 implying
high-quality earnings growth during 2021
