We believe the 3Q21 earnings (-35% YoY) has set a low base and expectations
from the stabilization of gross margin as sharp increase raw material price and
freight rate from the current high level looks less likely Besides the speed-up of
local government bond will help improve the machinery demand in China market

cutting edge technology in intelligent production Maintain BUY and TP of RMB30

China grew 13% YoY in 9M21 with 3ppt market share gain YoY (14ppt for

mainly due to the weak demand for medium size models as a result of
