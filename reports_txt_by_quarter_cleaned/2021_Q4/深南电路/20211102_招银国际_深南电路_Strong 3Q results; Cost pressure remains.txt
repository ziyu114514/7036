UpDownside
Shennan reported 3Q21 results with revenue of RMB39bn (26% YoY) and net
profit of RMB47mn (25% YoY) GPM was stable at 246% in 3Q (vs 245% in
2Q) while NPM improved QoQ to 120% (vs 101% in 2Q) We believe both
contributed to the strong revenue growth We think 3Q may be the best quarter
of the year as 4Q demand could be difficult to keep up With material price still at
their highs we remain conservative for Shennan Maintain HOLD and TP
adjusted to RMB11075
 Strong 3Q21 results driven by domesticoverseas 5G investments
Shennans 3Q revenue grew 263%228% YoYQoQ largely driven by its
3rd batch 5G tender in 3Q We estimate 5G BTS net-add will reach 692k in
in 2020 Overseas CSP investment was another contributor Gartner
estimated global 5G capex will increase 39% YoY this year Looking forward
we expect China 5G capex plan to maintain a similar level but overseas 5G
investment will increase 22% YoY in 2022E We believe Shennan will be the
key beneficiary with revenue growth of 166%153% YoY in 2022E23E
 Material cost pressure to continue Although Shennan managed to sustain
its overall GPM at 245% we think the cost pressure will continue Copper
price has slipped slightly from recent new high but remains at US95kton
(as of 1112021) With low domestic copper inventory we believe material
cost will remain an overhang However Shennan has improved its
profitability with better operating efficiency and NPM increased to 120% in
3Q from 89%101% in 1Q2Q
 Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB11075 We slightly raised our TP to
RMB11075 based on same 300x FY22E PE We think 3Q could be the best
quarter and demand will slightly ease in 4Q We maintain HOLD given
uncertainty in economy growth elevated material cost and constraints in
supply chain Potential upside risks include faster-than-expected decline of
material costs higher-than-expected 5G infrastructure spending and
consumer demand

In 1H21 Shennans PCB business has declined 14% YoY due to the delay of 5G BTS
deployment in China As soon as 3rd batch 5G tender resumed Shennans 3Q revenue
grew 263%228% YoYQoQ Meanwhile demand from overseas was also strong Gartner
estimated global 5G capex will increase 39% YoY this year However we think demand in
4Q is difficult to keep up with strong number delivered in 3Q considering the uncertainty in
economy growth elevated material cost constraints in supply chain
Looking forward we expect 5G Capex plan to maintain at a similar level in 2022E given
the de-spec trend in 5G BTS For example lower frequency spectrum equipment
accounted for the majority of 5G BTS tender this year (2021 700MHz21GHz vs 2020
26GHz35GHz) PCB growth will be largely driven by oversea 5G investment which is
expected to grow at 22% in 2022 according to Gartner Substrate business will continue to
deliver strong results as its Wuxi factory has entered the mid-to-late stage of ramp-up
Shennans PCB capacity was about 200w sq m per year The capacity of the Companys
PCB production was 80-85% in 1H21 The recent power shortage has not affected the
Companys operation but its PCB production line will not reach full capacity in 2H21 New
PCB capacity includes 1) Phase II plant in Nantong Jiangsu (58w sq m currently ramping
up in the mid-to-late stage) and 2) Phase III plant in Nantong Jiangsu (expected to begin
production in 4Q22) Substrate capacity was 30w per year New substrate capacity
includes 1) Wuxi Jiangsu (60w high-end substrate currently ramping up in the mid-to-late
stage) and 2) Guangzhou Guangdong (expected to begin production in 2023)
Figure 5 Capacity Schedule
Source Company data CMBIS estimates
Shennan announced to expand substrate capacity in Guangzhou production base which
will add 200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RFFC-CSP substrate capacity We expect the
new project to contribute revenue in 202324E Shennans existing substrate capacity has
been in full production since last year driven by strong semiconductor demand We believe
strong substrate revenue will continue into 2H21E driving 225% YoY growth in FY21E
The structural change of product mix will help to improve profitability but will be partially
offset by the high material costs Copper price has slipped slightly from the recent new high
but remains at US95kton (as of 1112021) With low domestic copper inventory we
maintain a conservative view

We slightly raised our TP to RMB11075 based on the same 300x FY22E PE We think
3Q could be the best quarter and demand will slight ease in 4Q We maintain HOLD rating
given uncertainty in economy growth elevated material cost and constraints in supply chain
Potential upside risks include faster-than-expected decline of material costs higher-than-
expected 5G infrastructure spending and consumer demand Potential downside risks
include continued price increase in upstream materials and slower-than-expected 5G
