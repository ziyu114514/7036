Hikvision reported in-line FY3Q21 with revenue operating profit growth of 22%
24% YoY respectively Innovative business growth remained strong at 53% YoY
with revenue contribution reaching 17% Although power cut impact is limited as
Hikvision has high inventory on hand (FY3Q21 inventory 26% QoQ) weakening
macro environment could weigh on FY22E growth outlook Maintain BUY with
lowered target price of RMB7625 (prior RMB7962)
 Resilient FY3Q21 Hikvision reported in-line FY3Q21 Revenue was at
RMB217bn (22% YoY) and net profit was at RMB45bn (18% YoY)
Excluding the time-lag of tax credit impact (recorded earlier in 2Q this year)
operating profit grew at 24% YoY on higher GPM (15 pct pts YoY to 464%)
 Demand Innovative business remained strong property sector
weakness to be reflected in FY2H22 Hikvision products cover 70 industries
now as camera applications expanded by embedding AI sensor technology
Innovative businesses (smart home products robotics industrial cameras
etc) continued to gain shape with revenue growth of 53% YoY to RMB37bn
in FY3Q21 contributing 17% of revenue Regarding weakening macro
environment as it is turning more difficult to acquire new land and newly
started construction area has been declining in China EBG business could
be negatively affected in FY2H22
 Supply Record-high inventory level to minimize power cut risk As we
flagged before there is no direct impact from power cut to Hikvision production
Hikvision maintained a high-inventory level strategy and expanded the
supplier list to minimize the potential risk In FY3Q21 Hikvision inventory level
came to a record high of RMB191bn (71% YoY 26% QoQ) Inventory as %
of sales was at 088 still lower than the level in 1Q20 at 132 (Hikvision being
added to entity list in Oct 2019)
 Maintain BUY We cut FY21-23E net profit by 2-5% to reflect lower sales
(macro to affect SMBG business) and lower margin on higher logistics cost
and RD Maintain BUY with new target price of RMB7625 (prior RMB7962)
based on unchanged 36x FY22 PE Key downside risks include raw material
shortage that could last for longer time higher logistic cost and weaker than
expected demand

Hikvision (002415 CH BUY TP RMB7625)
We cut target price to RMB7625 (prior RMB7962) based on unchanged 36x FY22 PE
50% above its 3-year mean We believe Hikvision deserves re-rating as supply chain risk
is mitigated after two years of product re-design new growth drivers (AI) in enterprise
segment is emerging and gross margin continues to expand Also Hikvision announced
plan to spin-off its smart home business (Ezviz Network) on STAR board We believe the
spin-off could provide new financing channel to support IoT AI RD
