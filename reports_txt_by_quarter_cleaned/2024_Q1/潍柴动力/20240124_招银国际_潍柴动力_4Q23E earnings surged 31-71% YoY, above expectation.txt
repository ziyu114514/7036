CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Weichai Power (000338 CH)
4Q23E earnings surged 31-71% YoY above
Weichai Power (Weichai) pre-announced last night (23 Jan) that net profit in
2023E is expected to surge 75-90% YoY to RMB858-932bn which is better
than expectations as both our and consensus estimates are only close to the
low end of the profit range The profit alert implies that Weichai delivered net
profit of RMB208-282bn in 4Q23E (up 31-77% YoY) with a midpoint of
RMB245bn (54% YoY) As we highlighted in our note on 15 Jan (link)
Weichais multi-cylinder diesel engine sales volume surged 51% YoY in 4Q23
(surpassing the industry average of 26%) driven by strong HDT engine
demand We maintain our bullish view on Weichai (sector top pick) as a
replacement cycle will offer certainty on HDT industry sales growth in 2024E
Maintain BUY with unchanged SOTP-based TP of HK194 (H)  RMB178 (A)
 LNGDiesel price spread expanded again The price ratio reached a
recent peak of 09 in late Dec 2023 which made LNG truck less attractive
to buyers That said with the latest LNG price declining 29% since late Dec
the price ratio dropped to 069 at present We believe the current price
difference will boost the sales of LNG trucks again given the lower operating
costs to truck owners We see this as a near-term driver for Weichai given
its 60% market share in the HDT gas engine segment
 Key catalysts 1) Further expansion of LNGDiesel price spread 2) strong-
than-expected HDT sales figures in 1Q24E
costs and 3) weaker-than-expected new business growth
