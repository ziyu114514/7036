CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Shennan Circuit (002916 CH)
FY23 results beat helped by better 4Q
Shennan Circuit released its FY23 earnings with revenue down 33% YoY to
RMB135bn (5%2% higher than our forecastconsensus) and net profit down
148% YoY to RMB14bn (11%5% higher than our forecastconsensus) The
Company beat estimates thanks to a stronger-than-expected 4Q The
quarterly revenueNP accounted for 30%35% of full year results 4Q revenue
increased by 159% YoY186% QoQ to RMB41bn and net profit increased by
66% YoY128% QoQ to RMB490mn GPM rose in three consecutive quarters to
242% in 4Q (vs 228%234% in 2Q3Q)
We expect Shennan to have a modest recovery this year as we believe the
PCB sector has reached the end of the trough in 2H23 2024 revenue growth
is projected to be 125% from a low base in 2023 given utilization rates of both
PCB and substrate businesses are up However we do not expect a full
recovery for Shennan at least not in 1H24 considering ongoing price
we are conservative in NP growth (10% in 2024) due to a potential increase in
copper price Maintain HOLD with TP adjusted to RMB79 based on 27x
2024E PE higher than previous 25x given the current position of the cycle but
lower than 5-year historical of 32x as challenges remain The stock is currently
trading at 285x 24E PE which is fair
 By segments in FY23 PCBsubstrate revenue both declined by 85% YoY to
RMB81bnRMB23bn while PCBA sales rose 215% to RMB21bn 2H23
results were much stronger with 80%492%808% increase from 1H
Substrate sales grew as downstream inventory digestion has almost ended
and utilization rate was back to 80% in 2H PCB growth was mainly driven by
autoenergy
contribution was not large GPM for PCB and substrate businesses were
266% and 239% declined by 157ppts and 311ppts respectively 2H23
GPM was improved from 1H for both segments (136ppts and 787ppts)
 Despite industry headwinds we think Shennan is poised for future growth as
the Company achieved a significant milestone in its FC-BGA production lines
Wuxi phase II and Guangzhou factories are ramping up capacity which will
benefit Shennan in the long run However in the short term these two
projects are likely to weigh on margins (RD exp up 31% in FY23)
 A potential increase in copper price We saw copper concentrates TC index
reached historical low at US11tonne in March In addition Fed may cut
rates in June 2024 These catalysts may favor a jump in copper price in the
near term which will hurt PCB suppliers GPM
