CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Shengyi Tech (600183 CH)
FY23 preliminary results review expect gradual
recovery in 2024
Shengyi Tech unveiled its FY23 earnings preview after Tuesdays market close
Full-year revenue was RMB166bn (-79% YoY) and net profit was RMB116bn (-
240% YoY) which were 3%13% and 3%9% lower than ourconsensus estimates
respectively For 4Q23 revenue decreased 23% YoY and 51% QoQ to RMB42bn
Quarterly net profit dropped more sharply by 208% YoY and 231% QoQ to
RMB2646mn The miss was mainly due to larger-than-expected declines in ASP in
eroded GPM although partially offset by growing shipments of CCL products
Looking forward we think the business will gradually recover in 2H24 after
bottoming in 1H New CCL product which has been certified by Nvidia and is
expected to begin the next testing phase soon should also contribute additional
revenue in 2024 Maintain BUY with TP adjusted to RMB1969
posted 2023 revenue of RMB33bn down 74% YoY due to heightened market
market share However GPM was significantly eroded Meanwhile Shengyi
Electronics is ramping up its production at one of its facilities (Dong Cheng IV)
which also put pressure on margin For 2024 we expect PCB segment revenue
to grow 10% YoY considering 2023 had a low base and expect a moderate
recovery in 2H24
 For the CCL segment excluding Shengyi Electronicss PCB sales revenue
from CCL and other business was RMB133bn down 80% YoY Revenue
decreased moderately in 4Q23 on weaker demand which was partially offset
by reduction in raw materials costs We forecast CCL segment revenue to grow
21% YoY with additional contribution from AI demand Shengyi Techs latest
ultralow (UL) loss CCL product has been certified by Nvidia and is expected to
begin the next testing phase soon
 We cut our 2024E revenue forecast by 4% and lower GPM by 07ppt to 221%
We expect the business will gradually recover in 2H24 with additional revenue
contribution from new customers Maintain BUY with adjusted TP of
RMB1969 based on the same 225x 2024E PE multiple less than 10%
lower than the stocks 5-year historical forward PE of 241x Potential
downside risks include 1) worse-than-expected macro environment recovery
2) continuous ASP pressure and 3) increasing upstream material costs
