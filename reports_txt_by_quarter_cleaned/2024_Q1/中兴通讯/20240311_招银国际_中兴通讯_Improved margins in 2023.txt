ZTE released its FY23 results Revenue grew by 11% YoY to RMB124bn in line
with consensus and 3% higher than our forecast Net profit increased by 154%
YoY to RMB93bn 5% lower than consensus and in line with our forecasts Gross
margin for 2023 was 415% representing a 434bps increase from FY22 NPM
showed a similar trend reaching 75% in FY23 from 42%59%66% in FY20-22
its net profit grew by 178% YoY and fell by 373% QoQ respectively The
sequential decline was mainly due to 1) a lower GPM (360% in Q4 vs 446%
in Q3) on a less favorable revenue mix which was partially offset by cost
and Enterprise segments 2) a 425% increase in SGA in Q4 on higher
employee benefits and marketing
 By segment 1) revenue from Carrier segment increased by 34% YoY on
domestic market share gains in RAN and non-RAN businesses and overseas
progress 2) Consumer segment sales declined by 13% YoY on overseas
growth in family network business 3) Enterprise  govt segment sales
declined by 71% YoY in 2023 due to a slowdown in investment
 Looking ahead to 2024 we believe ZTE is poised to capitalize on emerging
RMB342 based on 15x 2024E PE which is close to its 3-year avg (vs
previous 165x considering potential downside risk from continued industry
headwinds and slower-than-expected development in AI) Next catalyst may
