Driven by EV hype other prospects also
Outlook also better for EV batteries conventional cars monorail etc
We think BYDs share price rally is mainly driven by recent government and OEM
vows to hasten new energy vehicle (NEV) development However we also see
earnings upside in future years from areas such as electric vehicle (EV) battery
sales to third parties renewed designs for its car portfolio more monorail projects
additional handset materials an increase in solar module demand and residential
two-year EPS CAGR supporting more upside to the share price
NEV sector re-rating on sales pick-up and more positive news
Year-to-August China sold 320k units of NEVs up 30% YoY With the continuous
roll-out of more local government subsidy policies and more NEV models
available the negative impact of subsidy reduction on sales volume has abated
Together with Chinas latest vow to ban sales of pure conventional fuel vehicles in
the long run and globallocal OEMs recent announcements of more RD eorts
in NEVs we remain optimistic that we could see a 33% China NEV sales volume
ve-year CAGR in 2015-20E BYD should benet with its 20% market share
supplying EV batteries to third parties with the rst contract possibly being signed
Upside also for conventional cars monorail handset solar and power storage

BYD has launched the new Song Max MPV with the new Dragon Face design
We think the new design philosophy will enhance its future models appearance
system in Yinchuan with expectations of another 20 project rollouts in FY18
While we are still uncertain about this businesss protability we think the market
will start to give a valuation when more revenue is realized in FY18E Meanwhile
material For the solar module business we foresee sales improvement driven by
overseas orders such as the recent 170MW orders from the USs NextEra (NEEN
USD14655 Hold) Lastly we see additional lithium ion battery sales potential via
the B-Box energy storage system
Earnings upgrades on multiple revenue drivers higher implied target PE
Key downside risks weak car sales a slow
margin recovery in the battery and handset
fund raising Key upside risks rapid auto
sales and margin improvement and better
sales andor a margin recovery in the battery
We raise our FY17-19E revenue and earnings on a better sales outlook for various
businesses Our SOTP-derived target prices imply a target FY18E PE of 281x
which we believe is justied by BYDs exposure to Chinas NEV market

China NEV  A structural
Sector outperformance alongside NEV sales pick-up
Year-to-date Hong Kong and China listed NEV thematic stocks under our
coverage have rallied 37% on average (vs HSCEIs 16% and CSI300s 16%) We
think this is well supported by a 302% YoY increase in NEV sales to 320k units in
8M17 To elaborate passenger NEV sales volume rose 455% thanks to a wider
spectrum of NEV models oered by various brands in our view Meanwhile we
think that with the settling down of central and local government EV subsidy
schemes including the subsidy level cuts spearheaded by the central government
minus 338% in 1H17 to positive 576% in July-August Considering the sequential
improvement in sales we remain condent that China should register 28% growth
in 2017E NEV sales volume to about 650k units

grooming the NEV market
Besides the physical sales improvement we think that market sentiment on the
and OEMs To begin with Mr XIN Guobin Vice Minister of Chinas Ministry of
Industries and Information Technology (MIIT) said in an industry forum in early
September that China is considering a ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles in
future This echoes similar plans disclosed by the United Kingdom and France for
2040 While we do not think that a full ban will happen any time soon in China we
view the aforementioned initiatives together with the current subsidies as proof
of the Chinese governments determination to drive NEV usage going forward
In response to various countries increasing push on NEV adoption we also
observe that NEV RD was amongst the most talked about subjects at the most
recent Frankfurt Auto Show In brief global OEMs plan to further their eorts
in NEV development with more products to be rolled out by the end of this
decade What is more many of these OEMs also have plans to localize their NEV
production in China with the setting up of JVs

BYD stands to benet in multiple ways
NEV sales to pick up with new models and electric bus orders
In 8M17 BYD remains one of the leaders in China NEV sales with a 19% market
share (2016 22%) despite a YoY drop in sales Excluding JV sales BYD sold
27344 units of passenger EVs in 8M17 (up 140% YoY) but it sold just 29766 units
of passenger plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV down 255% YoY) and 5100 units
government subsidies on PHEVs 2) a lack of lower-pricelower-range passenger
EV models (a popular segment) vs peers and 3) the policy uncertainty over electric
buses at the beginning of the year
Figure 5 BYD - monthly passenger

While we do not think that BYD possesses much NEV product advantage vs
elaborate its recently launched new passenger NEV models (ie Qin 100 PHEV
Song PHEV and Song EV) have been selling well and BYD still plans to roll out
more lower-priced passenger EVPHEVs in FY18
up for the rest of the year with the recent announcement of more public bus
orders in Shenzhen We still retain our FY17 sales forecast of 15k units despite
BYD will continue to rise with 1) more cities (eg Guangzhou) electrifying their
public bus eet (probably by 2020E according to BYD) and 2) the rising adoption
of electric trucks in the area of sanitary trucks concrete mixers and dump trucks
On previous public occasions BYD has reiterated that it is considering supplying
EV batteries to third party OEMs besides in-house consumption According to the
some supply contracts could be signed by yearend
According to BYD its EV battery consumption should be about 10GWh this year
vs its existing EV battery production capacity of 13GWh In the foreseeable
(with 5GWh in phase one) in 2018 and the new facility will produce the more
advanced nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries As such we think that BYD
will have the capability to sell both lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and NMC batteries
to third parties and we estimate that it probably has room to sell 4GWh of EV
Last but not least as the Chinese government has recently conrmed that it is
considering less stringent requirements for foreign NEV entities to localize their
NEV production in China we may see increased participation of foreign OEMs

and thus potentially higher demand for local brand EV batteries an area that is
still well protected by the government
On 28 September the Chinese government released the nalized version of
Parallel Administrative Measures for Passenger Vehicle Corporate Average Fuel
Consumption (CAFC) and New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Credits which is also
to generate NEV credit points equivalent to 10% of sales by 2019 and 12% by
2020 by selling a certain number of EVs (about 2-5 points each depending
on range and battery eciency) and PHEVs (2 points each) The NEV credit
percentage requirement is applicable to traditional PV OEMs with more than
30k units of annual production or import volume in China Those who fail to get
sucient credits (ie by selling enough NEVs or buying credits from other OEMs
like BYD) will be suspended from producing or importing vehicles that cannot
meet the fuel eciency requirement
To obtain credit points equal to 10%12% of vehicles sold in 20192020 we
estimate that an OEM probably would need to achieve roughly 20-50%25-60%
NEV sales (as a % of total sales volume) depending on the NEV mix and NEV
advanced level While it may not be easy for traditional OEMs with a late start in
NEV rollout to achieve enough credits in 2019 in our view the government does

Ex-NEV optimistic about
Possible conventional car business recovery with new
BYD has just launched a new MPV model named Song Max with a price range
of RMB799-1199k Although the MPV segment is still small in China with a
demand decline this year the signicance of this BYD model is that it showcases
Mr Wolfgang Egger the ex-Head Designer of Audi (NSUGDE EUR70775 Not
Rated) while the chassis tuning was led by Mr Heinz Keck who joined from
Daimler (DAIGnDE EUR6747 Buy) We think that this revised design philosophy
will be adopted in future BYD models and an enhanced product image can

More monorail projects to be realized in 2018E onward
business known as SkyRail in the past ve years In early September BYD
a short 57km system in Yinchuans Flower Expo Park For FY17E BYD expects
to book about RMB5bn of revenue from the monorail business with about 40km
of the investors In FY18E BYD plans to begin construction of another 20 projects
(eg in Shantou and Guilin) with more cities under negotiation
While we are still uncertain about the monorail businesss protability BYD
once claimed that it could be more protable than the NEV business given less
some valuation to this business once more revenue is booked in FY18E

Handset business still in good shape
BYD has experienced solid growth in its handset-related business thanks to
consistently strong orders from major local brand clients such as Vivo and Xiaomi
growth driven by metal casing popularization in our view)
Solar and electrical energy storage business picking up
According to BYD its solar module business was loss-making in 1H17 While we
do not envision a meaningful recovery in the near term we think the trend will

BYD has shipped about 1GW of solar modules to date
Besides BYD introduced its B-Box electrical energy storage system in Europe
and Australia earlier this year to store the electricity generated by rooftop solar
Germany and BYD plans to introduce the system in the US market as well While
we do not expect the demand for B-Box to suddenly surge in future it can provide

Earnings upgrades on better revenue outlook
Mainly on the back of higher pricing forecasts for BYDs NEV business despite
lower volume forecasts for aggregate vehicle sales and higher revenue estimates
for the monorail business we raise BYDs FY17-19E revenue by 91-161% and
net prot by 111-198%

Valuation not stretched given rapid earnings rebound
Our SOTP-derived target prices are based on 1) a peer average FY18E PE of 147x
240x and 72x for the handset business (16% of SOTP value) battery business
(7% of SOTP value) and monorail business (2% of SOTP value) respectively and 2)
a peer average FY18E Psales of 14x and 22x for the conventional auto business
(10% of SOTP value) and the NEV business (65% of SOTP value) respectively
(vs the previous PE-to-growth methodology used for the auto business) since
we think the market cares more about BYDs NEV sales momentum rather than
immediate protability The implied target FY18E PE is 281x the highest target
PE benchmark among its local peers which we believe is justied by its unique
exposure to Chinas NEV market and its 37% FY17-19E two-year EPS CAGR We
maintain Buy on BYD-H on a positive earnings outlook driven by a NEV sales
recovery as well as potential EV battery sales to third parties We maintain Hold
on BYD-A given the valuation premium to the H-shares

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
