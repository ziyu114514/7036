An emerging national champion raising TP
According to an ancient Chinese proverb to win a battle it requires the right time
right place and right people In the battle for market share in Chinas industrial
automation (IA) sector we believe all these three factors align with Inovance
In terms of timing the Chinese governments strong push for manufacturing
upgrades and promotion of high-end manufacturing should help to sustain robust
IA demand in the next 10 years On top of it local players who focus on hardware
equipment will accelerate their market share expansion given the governments
intention to promote local champions Along with managements impressive
market insights and distinct vertical-based strategy we believe Inovance is well
placed to top the inverter and servo markets in China by 2025 With sustainable
long-term growth and an industry-leading position we believe the stocks current
valuation premium is warranted We raise target price to Rmb343
Made in China 2025 was rst unveiled in May 2015 at a time when Chinas
manufacturing industry and IA market were struggling Thanks to a strong top-
down push from the government Chinas IA market started to recover in 2H16
with the recovery positively surprising in recent quarters We view this round of
IA recovery as structural instead of cyclical and hence we believe it is highly likely
to persist in the next 10 years Apart from government support manufacturers
who are facing poor quality low eciency and labor shortages have also started
to voluntarily automate their production facilities This trend has now spread
into traditional verticals such as textile machinery machine tools and metallurgy
We expect Chinas overall IA demand to post a 10% CAGR in 2017-20 while
the general servo and low-voltage inverter markets Inovances two focused
segments to register a CAGR of c20% and 10% respectively over 2016-20 (vs
6% and -5% over 2011-16) Over 2021-25 we expect Chinas general servo and
low-voltage inverter markets to witness a CAGR of 10% and 5% respectively (vs
Chinas overall IA market 5%)
Chinas current manufacturing upgrades still largely center on hardware
equipment which has been Inovances strong suit In addition the governments
promotion of localization has been intensifying which would accelerate local
players to gain market share Currently 65% of Chinas IA market is still

dominated by foreign players In some of Inovances focused markets the ratio
can be as high as c90% Leveraging its deeper understanding of local customers
and improving the price-to-performance ratio of its products Inovance has
successfully grown into a local leader capable of challenging MNCs positions
in certain areas Its low-voltage inverter and general servo already ranked No3
and No5 respectively in China With accelerating import substitution we expect
the general servo market by 2020 By 2025 Inovance is highly likely to lead both
markets based on our estimates
With the right people
Inovances success in our view is probably more driven by its management than
its technology andor products A strong evidence to support this is the local
at a similar time with similar technology but have fallen signicantly behind
Inovance after a decade of operations Driven by managements aggressive
but practical manner Inovance has successfully penetrated into multiple areas
including inverter servo and NEV and quickly built up a leading position
Inovance recently launched a distinctive vertical-based penetration strategy
pushing existing products to customers the core strategy is to focus on deeply
understanding customers trued needs and developing customized products
Through this practice Inovance can not only penetrate but also quickly dominate
customized drive solutions (invertercontroller) Inovance has rapidly occupied
more than 23 market share of this particular vertical The most recent successful
cases are textile machinery and metallurgy and we expect many other verticals
to follow
The same thing can be said about NEV
Inovance has been a proven leader in the NEV bus drive market and we expect
such success to be repeated in the logistics and passenger NEV Growth for
logistics NEV drive this year has been ahead of market expectation and we expect
such to continue to surprise the market on the upside By 2020 we expect
Inovance to take a 60% share in Chinas logistics NEV drive market bringing
in Rmb1bn in revenue (or 36% of the total NEV segment) and surpassing NEV
bus revenue Meanwhile its passenger NEV drive business is also progressing
well having secured 5-6 tier-2 automakers and is likely to secure another 1-2
tier-1 automaker(s) by year-end Over the longer term we believe having a strong
electronics platform (through its IA business) will give Inovance signicant cost
advantage over its peers (eg lower sourcing pricing for IGBT due to larger
volume) which will further facilitate its market share expansion
Fine-tuning earnings and raising target price maintaining Buy
We trim our earnings estimates by 3-4% for 2017-19E mainly reecting our
investment in the passenger NEV drive business Still our 2018-19E earnings are
5-10% higher than consensus forecasts We see upside potential in our current
As we turn more bullish on Inovances long-term growth prospects we lift our
target price by 14% to Rmb343 after raising our long-term growth assumptions
and rolling forward our valuation timeframe to 2018 We maintain Buy

High IA growth to sustain
The right time Chinas manufacturing upgrades are
Made in China 2025 was rst unveiled by the State Council in May 2015 at
a time when Chinas manufacturing industry was clearly struggling and Chinas
IA market was heading south Approximately one year after the document was
released Chinas IA market started to recover thanks to the top-down push by
the government The strength of recovery has been ahead of market expectations
growth in 3Q17 accelerated to 15% (Figure 1) much stronger than what the
market had expected
Figure 1 Since bottoming out in 4Q15 Chinas IA
market has been recovering strongly especially in recent

More importantly growth of the OEM market (mainly equipment manufacturing
industry) has already surpassed that of the project market (or end-user verticals)
since 2013 and the gap further widened starting 2016 (Figure 2) The emergence
of the equipment manufacturing industry signals that Chinas real automation
upgrade is indeed taking place
We believe 2013-16 probably marks the start of Chinas broad-based automation
upgrades and this round of upgrade cycle may last as long as 10-20 years due
dierent from other countries (eg Japans manufacturing industry is mainly
driven by 3C and automotive etc)
We expect Chinas overall IA demand to post a 10% CAGR over 2017-20E and
a CAGR of 5% over 2021-25E We forecast the total IA market size in China to
reach cRmb260bn by 2025

General servos 14% CAGR over 2017-25E a Rmb24bn market by 2025
Servo or more precisely servo system is a servo driver and a servo motor It is
essentially an extension of inverter as servo drive is not only capable of controlling
speed and torque of a motor (as inverters do) but is also capable of providing
position control to a motor Therefore servo system has an extensive application
in the manufacturing sector and remains a key part of the industrial automation
Currently servo is still at its early stage of penetration in China evidenced by
downstream vertical machine tool has been the largest one accounting for 30%
of the total market (used to be 45% prior to 2013) On the other hand electronics
manufacturing equipment (mainly 3C) has been the fastest-growing vertical in
recent years accounting for c20% of the total market in 2016 vs 10% in 2006

Most other verticals for general servos however have a market size of around
Rmb100-200mn (Figure 13) These small verticals are widely viewed as mid- to
low-end segments which are the key targets for Chinas manufacturing upgrades
This points to a substantial growth potential for servo market going forward

While import substitution has generally turned out to be slow in Chinas IA market
improving product quality and lifting price-to-performance higher than MNCs
the governments intention of raising local content would facilitate market share

market growth for both inverter and servo segments We project a revenue CAGR
of 20% and 40% for Inovances sales of inverters and servos respectively

NEV - similar story as IA
The right time the global vehicle electrication trend and
Chinese governments strong push
We believe the Chinese government is determined to promote NEV given
Chinas 1) energy structure 2) pollution concerns and 3) ambition for technology
leadership The recent news regarding China developing a plan to phase
out vehicles powered by fossil fuels and implementing a dual-credit scheme
exemplies the governments eort to accelerate the development of this market
The governments crackdown on subsidy cheating in 2016 created disruption to
the market but the impact proved to be only short lived After eight months of
suspending catalogue approvals MIIT resumed approval process in December
2016 Since February Chinas NEV market has staged a strong recovery with
volume growth accelerating to 78% in September
Although YTD sales of NEV bus still register negative growth volume has reverted
to positive growth since June (Figure 25) On the other hand sales volume
of passenger NEV has been strong since February and the strength further
accelerated to close to 100% in September (Figure 24)

The right place third-party suppliers to prevail over
automakers in Chinas NEV controller market
Electrical controller is indeed an application of Inovances drive technology in
the NEV eld Through the exclusive supply agreement with the local bus leader
Yutong Inovance successfully established its footprint in this market
At the current stage in-house production and sourcing from third-party providers
are main options for NEV automakers The two parties largely equally share the
market BYD being the major one adopting in-house production accounts for
25% of total NEV controller market (Figures 28 and 29)

Although automakers have strong intention to master the core technology most
local automakers are nal assemblers that lack RD capability to support in-
house production Moreover when production volume ramps up signicantly
substantial quality risk and cost pressure would emerge which would make
in-house production a less optimal option Third-party suppliers could take
advantage of economies of scales by supplying products to the entire industry
while most mid to small automakers can not We therefore believe third-party
OEMs will likely gradually gain market share as NEV sales rise
still evolving especially for the passenger NEV segment Although earlier movers
such as UAES and Shanghai E-drive have already established their footprint in this
market we believe Inovance can still penetrate and grab decent market share
cooperation with Brusa
Moreover as volume signicantly ramps up we believe Inovances strong cost
dedicated third-party NEV driver producers Inovance has a strong electronics
platform (due to its IA business) which would oer substantial cost advantage
(eg lower sourcing prices for IGBT and capacitors due to larger purchasing
increasingly more cost conscious Therefore we believe Inovances strong cost
The right people we like managements strategy
developed for passenger NEV
Inovance has been a proven NEV drive leader in the NEV bus segment but
relatively new to the passenger NEV segment While being the exclusive NEV
controller supplier of Yutong Bus is an endorsement of Inovances product quality
and technology breaking into passenger OEMs supply chain system is not easy
given rigorous requirements for product safety and quality which requires high
RD investment and close cooperation with auto OEMs

with Brusa which was founded in 1985 and is mainly involved in electric
charger etc) Brusas product line coupled with its leading technology
Inovance is mainly focusing on NEV controller in the longer term
Inovance will develop its electric motor as well as gearbox by leveraging
Brusas advantages
Better product integration Existing local players have focused on
oering controller plus motor solutions but Inovance is taking this
one step further by oering 3-in-1 powertrain solutions consisting of
controller motor and gearbox The benets to automobile manufacturers

motor and inverter enable the simple integration of the drive units within
motor and controller separately for local NEV makers mastering the
powertrain technology will prepare Inovance for the likely intensifying
the China market possibly in 2019
ISO certification While it is not yet strictly required by local NEV OEMs
getting ISO certied (ISO26262 in this case)  one of the highest safety-
related certications globally  is an endorsement of product safety
and quality Inovance is the rst local player to successfully roll out
automated production lines and obtain the ISO26262 certication for
its NEV drive business Our channel checks also suggest most local
passenger NEV drive suppliers have not been certied
Leveraging Brusas leading technology and Inovances sound strategies (ie
providing integrated powertrain  acquiring ISO certicate) we are increasingly
condent that Inovance will repeat its success in the passenger NEV eld
2017-19 logistics NEV to drive growth beyond 2019
passenger NEV to take o
Although NEV bus fell short of expectations so far this year due to weak volume
from Yutong as well as iASP cut logistic NEV positively surprised YTD and will
also raised its full-year revenue target for its logistics NEV segment to Rmb350m
(from Rmb200m guided at the beginning of 2017)
We estimate that the market size of Chinas logistics NEV drive market will
probably be around Rmb800-900m in 2017 (volume of 100k units x ASP of
Rmb8-9k) which means that Inovance occupies c40% market share We expect
the overall market to continue to register a 22% CAGR over 2018-2020 and
Inovance to further grow its market share to 60% by 2020E This suggests that
Inovances logistic NEV revenue will grow at a CAGR of 33% over 2018-20E more
than oset the potential softness from NEV bus Based on this trend we expect
contributor for the whole NEV segment starting 2019 (Figure 31)
In terms of passenger NEV business despite surging opex which pressured
Inovances protability in 2017 the heavy investment in passenger NEV has
nally started to show progress In 1H17 Inovance managed to secure 5-6
tier-2 passenger NEV customers to supply its controller products Management
is condent that it can secure 1-2 tier-1 passenger NEV customer(s) in 2H17 and
expects the business to take o in 2019
We expect Inovances sales of passenger NEV controller to post a CAGR of 133%
over 2017-20 By 2020 we expect Inovance to take a 10% share in Chinas
passenger NEV controller market with revenue contribution reaching cRmb1bn

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
