We raise our target price for CITS by 375% to RMB55 from RMB40
Management has publicly guided that its duty-free business is likely to see
growth of over 60% yoy for FY2017 Also we believe consensus hasnt
factored in profit from Beijing Airport the potential opening of a downtown
duty-free store and the consolidation of duty-free in Shanghai Airport Given its
robust and sustainable growth high barriers to entry and attractive valuation
Profit from BCIA should be higher than the consensus estimate
We expect RMB66bn duty-free sales from BCIA (T2  T3) in 2018 We believe
the market is overly concerned with the high concessionaire rate from Beijing
Airport 1) during the transitional 12m CITS will pay the original concessionaire
rate agreed with Sunrise and 2) there is still room for GM improvement given
the size-up (CITS duty-free GP margin was only c45% vs Dufrys 60% in
2016) We estimate RMB623m profit contribution for 2017 and RMB349m for
2018 We believe this has not been factored into WINDBloomberg consensus
Haitang Bays robust growth may continue all the way to 2020
We have grown more confident on Haitang Bay duty-free sales after our recent
channel checks We expect duty-free sales to hit RMB655bn in 2017 yoy
growth of 43% and to grow another 28% in 2018 Our channel check found
that there are two new additions of luxury hotel resorts (new supply of 800-
1000 rooms) in Haitang Bay every year to meet the strong demand from
domestic travelers We also believe Atlantis and Haichang Ocean Park two in-
progress theme parks could add another 5-6m travelers to Haitang Bay All
these incremental travelers should benefit duty-free sales long-term growth
Two more significant catalysts may double current profit  not priced in yet
We believe the current share price hasnt fully factored in two near-mid-term
catalysts a downtown duty-free store and consolidation of duty-free business
in Shanghai PudongHongqiao Airports These two events are likely to bring a
further cRMB12bn in earnings to CITS which is 35% on top of our 2018E
Our TP of RMB55 implies a forward PER of 24x on our 2018 earnings
forecasts which we believe is very attractive given that the duty-free business
is protected and enjoys barriers to entry in China We derive our TP based on
DCF (81% WACC 9% cost of equity beta of 09 and 30% TGR unchanged)

Beijing Airport profit seems
under-estimated
Profit from BCIA seems higher than consensus
Concessionaire rate followed previous agreement during 66 transitional
We believe the market is overly concerned about the high concessionaire rate
(c435% for T3 and 475% for T2) from Beijing Airport As per management
disclosure on the 3Q17 earnings conference call CITS will pay the original
concessionaire rate (c20-30%) agreed with Sunrise during the next transitional
6-12 months
Consensus has not fully factored in profit from BCIA
CITS seems to be more aggressive after taking over the operations of Beijing
Airport by introducing more international cosmetic brands to meet consumers
desire to trade-up As a result we expect its top line to post a c20% CAGR
during 2017-2019E and there will likely be improvement in the gross margin
driven by the size-up
As a result we expect duty-free sales from BCIA (T2  T3) to deliver RMB66bn
in 2018E and we estimate it could contribute an incremental RMB623m in
profit (concessionaire rate of 25%) for 2017E and cRMB350m (concessionaire
rate of 36%) for 2018E

Haitang Bays long-term
growth looks more firm
Expect visitor CAGR in Haitang Bay to be 20% 2017-19E
2017 YTD visitor growth in Sanya is 12% yoy
According to Sanya City Statistics the number of tourists who stay overnight
increased by 122% yoy to 128 million in 9M17 We expect Sanya to enjoy
15% traffic growth in 2018-2019E as shown in the chart below Haitang Bay is
entertainment Therefore we expect Haitang Bays tourists will register a 20%
CAGR in 2018-2019E as more people are willing to stay there

New addition of hotel supply in Haitang Bay is sufficient
Currently visitors to Haitang Bay rarely have any night life except to stay in
the hotel resorts As it is the only shopping mall in Haitang Bay we believe
most overnight visitors will visit the mall for shoppingfun in the evening
Therefore we also have channel-checked the luxury hotel resort pipeline in
Haitang Bay
On average three more new luxury hotels opening every year
As shown in the table below more than 10 luxury hotel resorts will start
business in Haitang Bay over the next three years We have seen incremental
growth of visitors in Haitang Bay Normally CITS will work with these hotels
on shuttle bus arrangements

Three more leisure resortsparks to extend visitors stay
As we mentioned earlier most visitors have no leisure events in the evening
other than to spend time in the hotel resorts We believe two more thematic
parkresorts will further extend visitors stay length in Haitang Bay
1) Atlantis to open in early 2018E
The worlds third Atlantis Hotel Resort is scheduled to open at the beginning of
2018 Atlantis is only 3km away from the duty-free shopping mall Therefore
we believe the establishment of Atlantis will direct sufficient visitors towards
the shopping mall
Atlantis Resort is not only a luxury hotel (with 1314 rooms) but also a
water park located only 3km from the Haitang Bay duty-free shopping
We expect Atlantis to attract an incremental 3-4 million visitors to the
Haitang Bay area in 2018E
2) Haichang Dream World will start operations in early-2019E
Haichang Dream World is scheduled to start operation by the end of 2018E
The project is invested by Haichang Ocean Park (2255HK Non-rated)
a leading developer and operator of ocean theme parks in China
Management disclosed that Haichang theme park is expected to
attract c5-6 million tourists in its mature stage
3) Island project in Haitang Bay DFS open in 2019E
The Island project is owned by CITS and is opposite the current duty-free
will start operation by the end of 2018E
CITS has invested RMB840m in the construction of the Island project

since the beginning of 2017 and it plans to start operations by the end

Two potential catalysts
Two more catalysts could double profit
Management guided that they are in progress
There are two more projects that CITS is working on but the timeline is not
certain 1) to take over the duty-free business of the airports in Shanghai and
2) to open a downtown duty-free store in Beijing
As those two projects are policy driven it is difficult to analyze the timing in
executing these projects However we believe they could be the catalysts for
the share price in the medium term We have performed a sensitivity analysis
on the earnings and risk-reward here
Conclusion we believe the duty-free business in Shanghai airports and the
downtown duty-free store in Beijing are likely to contribute cRMB12bn net
profit to CITS (note that our 2018E earnings forecast for CITS is RMB34bn)
Catalyst No 1  Shanghai HQPD airport
Sunrises duty-free operation license is expected to expire in 2018 Therefore
the market has been expecting CITS to take over the operation rights in two
airports in Shanghai We believe winning BCIA is a milestone for CITS and
taking over from Sunrise in Shanghai could follow the same process
Shanghai Airport (Pudong  Hongqiao) currently enjoys annual
International traffic of c40 million (35 million in Pudong and 5 million
in Hongqiao)
Although there is no public data for Sunrises (the current duty-free
operator) sales numbers for the existing Shanghai Hongqiao we
estimate that duty-free stores in Shanghai airport are likely to generate
cRMB7-8bn duty-free sales higher than BCIA
If we assign a 7-8% net margin to the business CITS is likely to
generate another RMB490-640m net profit
Catalyst No 2  Downtown Duty-Free in Beijing
much longer than for duty-free in the airports 2) the ticket price is higher and
3) CITS doesnt have to pay concessionaire to the airports
Located in Beijings Central Business District the downtown duty-free store in
Beijing is currently only open to foreigners (including people from Hong Kong
Macau and Taiwan)
Due to such restrictions the current traffic volume is quite small However
from the Ministry of Finance to extend the purchase qualification to domestic
citizens who go abroad
Earnings upside potential from downtown duty-free
If the downtown duty-free is approved by the Chinese government we believe
it could contribute an additional cRMB600m net profit to CITS on top of our
current estimate
10 November 2017
Hotels  Leisure  Gaming
Deutsche Bank AGHong Kong
No need to pay concessionaire fee to BCIA  customers can get their
duty-free products in airports but CITS doesnt have to pay 40%
concessionaire sales to BCIA if the purchase happens in the
downtown duty-free store
Higher ticket price  customers tend to shop more in the downtown
DFS than the airport DFS mainly due to the better shopping
Haitang Bay as an example consumption per person was cRMB4700
in 2016 Per person purchases in BCIA are less than RMB1000
Sensitivity analysis on earnings potential upside
We have performed a sensitivity analysis on how much upside downtown
duty-free can contribute to our 2018 earnings estimate
Net margin  we assign a 15% net margin gap between Downtown
and Airport DFS due to their rent cost difference
Portion of international traffic  we assign 25% as the portion of total
international traffic that will likely shop in Downtown DFS Note that
the international traffic of BCIA was 25 million in 2016 we assume a
25% duty-free conversion rate
Ticket price  we conservatively assume consumption per visit in
Downtown DFS will be RMB2000 (vs c4700 in Haitang Bay in 2016)
As a result we estimate additional earnings could be cRMB600m
which accounts for c 17% of our 2018E CITS earnings

We believe the risk-reward profile is attractive Our target price implies 35%
upside potential
Bull case If we factor in the two catalysts in our DCF model the
upside could be as high as 62%
Bear case If we lower our revenue growth to zero from year 2020 in
our DCF model the target price would be RMB36 implying the
downside risk to its close is 14%

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
