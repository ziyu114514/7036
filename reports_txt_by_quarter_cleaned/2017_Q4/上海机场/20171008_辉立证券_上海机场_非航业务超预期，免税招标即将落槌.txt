航空業務收入受准點率考核影響，同比增長
2017 年上半年，受益於相對低油價和宏觀經濟緩慢復蘇，中國航空業穩中有進，航空
流量保持良好的增長勢頭，市場需求旺盛，航空客運市場保持快速增長。2017 年上半
年全行業的運輸總周轉量、旅客運輸量、貨郵運輸量分別按年增長125%、134%、
51%。全國機場錄得的飛機起降架次、旅客吞吐量、貨郵吞吐量亦相應按年增長
104%、135%、89%，具體到上海機場，對應的三項指標的同比增幅分別為39%、
65%、136%。
受到准點率考核未達標影響，公司的飛機起降架次、旅客吞吐量增幅小於行業平均，
拖累上半年航空性業務收入僅同比增長35%至1803 億元。同時，從結構上看，國內
航線的旅客吞吐量增幅（11%）遠高於國際航線（3%），而國際航線的貨運吞吐量
增幅表現亮眼（18%）。

非航業務超預期，大增
業績超預期的主要原因來自于高增長的非航業務。上半年公司實現非航收入
2094 億元，同比大幅增長26%，占總收入比重擴大5 個百分點至54%，首次超
過航空業務收入。其中商業租賃收入大幅提升3599%至1436 億元，主要受益
於T1 航站樓改造完成後商業面積擴大；其他非航業務提升968%至658 億元。
免稅招標即將落槌，樞紐機場價值穩固
公司的機場免稅業務合同將於2018 年3 月到期，管理層表示正在進行新一輪招
標計劃，我們預計年底前有望啟動。預計新的提成比例由原來的25%左右上漲
至45%，大幅增厚業績。
2017 年上半年，上海機場的年旅客吞吐量鞏固了全國第二的排名，其中國際和
地區的旅客量繼續保持全國第一。公司仍在繼續推進以上海為中心的長三角經
濟帶空中樞紐的建設，持續優化航線網絡結構，重點發展國際遠程航線，上半
年上海機場新增國際通航點2 個，加密遠程航線2 條，並且新增3 家國外航空
公司，歐美遠程航線市場得到了加強。截止6 月末，上海機場共有通航點234
個，其中國內和國際（包括地區）分別為109 個和125 個，彰顯樞紐機場地位
穩固。未來2025 年三期擴建工程完成後，旅客吞吐量將超8000 萬人次，再加
上由單航站樓雙跑道向多航站樓多跑道運營模式的跨越，預計公司將
開啟新一輪的穩健成長之路。
