Heading for growth spurt from first Gen6
BOE unveiled Chinas first worlds second Gen6 flexible AMOLED
display production line BOE Technology a leading display manufacturer
has pulled the trigger on its Chengdu-based Gen6 flexible active-matrix
organic light-emitting diode (AMOLED) linebuilt in the space of less
than five months well ahead of schedule At a delivery ceremony the
top Chinese handset makers such as Huawei Oppo Vivo Xiaomi ZTE and
nubia The new launch would significantly boost BOEs standing in the
flexible OLED field
Rising flexible OLED display demands spur and sustain future growth
Some of the worlds prominent smartphone players are jockeying to play
the ace of flexible OLED for their next big thing as witnessed by Apples
patented iPhone design featuring a bifold or trifold screen thought to hit
the market sometime and Samsungs debuting this year of a futuristic
OLED panel able to be stretched scrolled and folded This coupled with
growing flexible OLED demands emanating from other segments like
wearables VR devices tablets and notebooks would benefit an industry
leader like BOE which is now in a better position for a potential deluge
of bendable and foldable display orders mostly from well-famed mobile
devices and wearables producers
BOEs profitability set to shoot up as flexible OLED line yield improves
A single 48000-unit flexible OLED line is expected to close in on the
breakeven point on a 50% yield which when ramps up to 80% would
lead to an annual profit of about RMB14bnoutstripping BOEs LCD
arms 2017 profitand a ROE of nearly 30% well above roughly 10% for
significantly shore up its profitability through yield and capacity increase
at its flexible OLED business in our view

2 BOEs profitability set to surge as flexible OLED line yield improves
BOEs first flexible OLED line was built in the space of less than five months with its yield ramp-up time much shorter
in OLED as well as its adoption of first-class equipment and materials BOE boasts to have engaged in OLED RD for eight
years (five years on flexible) and obtained 55000 patents (16000 concerning OLED)

A highlight in BOEs flexible OLED line is its use of Canon Tokkis vacuum evaporation equipment which is widely utilized
by the likes of Samsung LG and Sharp for small- and medium-sized OLED display production

Based on a market price of USD120 for a 55-inch flexible quarter high definition (QHD) display it takes a 50% yield for
a 48000-unit flexible OLED line of BOE to close in on the breakeven point (an estimated annual net profit of RMB490mn)
assuming a unit cost of USD80 and an 80% yield to generate an annual revenueprofit of around RMB75bn1385bn
unit cost of USD65 and it is estimated that at its full capacity a single such production line will create a profitability
flexible OLED business will dramatically drive up its overall profitability and provide an impetus for medium- and long-
term business growth in our view

3 Rising demands for flexible OLED displays spur and sustain future
Assuming a capacity utilization rate of 90% and a yield of 85%65% for rigidflexible screens we estimate global supply
of 55-inch OLED mobile phone screens will climb from 470mn (180mn290mn for flexiblerigid) in 2017 to 790mn
(420mn370mn for flexiblerigid) in 2018 and 126bn (720mn540mn for flexiblerigid) in 2019 while global demands
for such products will rise from 490mn in 2017 to 770mn11bn139bn171bn in 2018201920202021 Hence a
supply-demand equilibrium is expected to arrive around 2019 but we believe global OLED display production capacity
expansion will charge on nonetheless on the back of a 50% penetration for mobile phones growing market potential
for foldable screens and relatively low levels of take-up for such products as VR devices tablets and notebooks
has announced plans to beef up production of its flexible OLED displays—which have been adopted by Apple for the
tenth anniversary iPhone X—to a level of 330000 with a market share estimated to exceed 50% over the next three
years LG Display following a flagging attack on the large-sized OLED TV panel market has also started to shift its focus
towards small-sized OLED displays with its Gumi-based E5 flexible OLED line already put into mass production in 3Q17
and its E6 production line scheduled for 2018 eying a production capacity of at least 75000 units for small- and medium-
sized flexible OLED displays
BOE with a total capacity of 96000 from its two flexible OLED lines trails only behind Samsung while its rival Hon
HaiFoxconn is setting sights on a flexible OLED display production capacity of no lower than 50000

The above data suggests that current small- and medium-sized OLED display sales are predominantly driven by
smartphone replacement demands with high growth also seen in the wearables segment And a 52% penetration for
smartphones by 2019 points to substantial growth potential for small-sized OLED display demands worldwide

smartphones that could change size depending on use Big-name players such as Apple Samsung LG Microsoft and
Lenovo have been deploying in this field for quite some time In 2016 Lenovo amazed the world with a pioneering
bendable wrist-phone named Lenovo C which is a proper smartphone when fully extended and can be turned into a
