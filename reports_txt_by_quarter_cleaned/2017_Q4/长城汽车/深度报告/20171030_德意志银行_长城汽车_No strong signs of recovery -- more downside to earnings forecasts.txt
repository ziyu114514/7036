No strong signs of recovery -- more
downside to earnings forecasts
After listening to Great Wall Motors (GWM) post-3Q17 results conference call we
by the ramp-up of WEY brand sales Yet the negatives that made the latest results
so poor will still dominate in our view The painful impact of old models suering
segment and we have cut our already low FY17 estimates by a further 268%
This translates to another YoY drop in quarterly earnings of 12% in 4Q17E
Looking into FY18 there will be further gains from new model launches which
should add 15ppt to the gross prot margin in our estimate However this will
still be a long way short of the 21%-plus level seen in FY10-16 This is because
and hence we reduce our FY1819 net prot forecasts by 104-107% Our new
target price is cut by 11% based on 70x FY18E PE (unchanged) which is below
Great Walls historical H-share trading average considering the lack of long-term
EPS growth We believe that our target multiple is justied given a FY16-19E
three-year EPS CAGR of -4% Key upside risks are stronger-than-expected new
model sales and a margin rebound

Post results conference call highlights
Great Wall Motor (GWM) hosted a conference call earlier today after posting an
80% YoY plunge in 3Q17 net prot Key takeaways are
Management attributes the 3Q17 margin squeeze to 1) increase in
advertising expenses 2) ocial price cuts of older products 3) higher
sales incentives and 4) low initial margins for the new models Going
forward management expects margins to rebound on rising new model
sales partly helped by last-minute buying in 4Q17E before the end of tax
stimulus To facilitate growth GWM aims at having 100-150 upscale WEY
brand 4S stores by the end of 2017 and further ramp up monthly sales
for the WEY VV5 SUV to about 10k units
For the new model pipeline The WEY brand will launch a plug-in hybrid
model P8 at the end of 2017 and another model in 2018 The Haval brand
and new energy vehicle variants between now and 2018
The annual production capacity for the in-house 7-speed DCT gearbox will
increase from 250k units in 2017 to 500k units in 2018 The gearbox will
be used in both WEY brand and Haval brand Besides the better economy
of scale when new model sales ramp up GWM believes that the usage
of in-house gearbox would help to lower unit costs and claims that the
new models should achieve better margins than the older models going
Regarding GWMs potential JV tie-up with BMW (BMWGDE EUR8628
Buy) to produce MINI vehicles in China management said that the two
parties are still working on this project without further details to disclose
That being said there are still uncertainties
GWM argued that some other local brands also struggled this year

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
aected by the currency of an underlying security eectively assume currency risk
