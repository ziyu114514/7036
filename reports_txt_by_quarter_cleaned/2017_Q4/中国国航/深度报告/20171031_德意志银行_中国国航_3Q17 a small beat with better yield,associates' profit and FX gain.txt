3Q17 a small beat with better yield
associates prot and FX gain
Core operation shows resilience with decent yield trend
Air China released its 3Q17 results under PRC GAAP after market close on 27
October Despite a mild 38% passenger trac (RPK) YoY growth the airlines
gross revenue increased by 91% YoY to RMB348bn probably on the back of
yield improvement thanks to the successful implementation of airfare increase
strategy in our view More importantly Air Chinas 3Q17 revenue grew faster than
the 89% operating cost growth notwithstanding higher fuel cost YoY Although
than the loss recorded in 1H17 probably due to some nancial improvement in
its Cathay Pacic (0293HK HKD1336 Sell) associate in our view Together with
RMB appreciation Air China achieved a 314% YoY jump in reported net prot
to RMB50bn
Deutsche Bank view  stable core business partially masked by Cathay
Figure 1 Air China - trac and
Passenger traffic (RPK YoY%)
Passenger capacity (ASK YoY%)
Source Company data
On a 9M17 basis Air Chinas reported net prot of RMB83bn (up 146% YoY)
accounts for 114% of our full-year FY17 estimates and 103% of Bloomberg
consensus forecasts Even though 4Q is usually a slow season for Chinese airlines
we see upside risk to our full year forecast probably due to decent yield trend
and higher than expected FX gain In September Air China recorded steady 63%
YoY passenger trac (RPK) growth driven by 82% YoY growth in international
most fundamentally sound airline in China with diversied growth in dierent
routes and good yield management track record we think its earnings upside will
likely be capped by Cathay Pacics weakness Therefore we maintain a Hold on
Air China H shares Meanwhile we have a Sell rating on its A shares given their
signicant valuation premium over the H-shares Our target price for Air China is
based on 105x FY18E PBV marginally below its mid-cycle valuation since 2011
We believe the valuation benchmark is prudent given 9% FY18E core ROE which
is slightly below the historical average since 2011 Key downside risks include
excessive new capacity on international routes and weakening in Cathay Pacics
earnings contribution Key upside risks are the reverse of the aforementioned

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
aected by the currency of an underlying security eectively assume currency risk
