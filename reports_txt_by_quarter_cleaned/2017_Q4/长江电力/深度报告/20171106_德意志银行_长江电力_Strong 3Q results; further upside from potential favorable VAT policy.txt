potential favorable VAT policy
Yangtze Power reported robust 3Q17 results with net prot up by 11% to
Rmb97bn As a result 9M17 net prot increased by 9% yoy to Rmb178bn
accounting for 90% of our previous full-year forecast (historically 79-83%) The
3Q earnings growth are primarily driven by a 4% yoy increase in power output
operational cost Consequently we lift FY1718 earnings by 109% on the back
of strong 3Q results With 15% upside to our new target price of Rmb183 we
reiterate Buy on Yangtze Power given 1) a high-quality hydro power assets with
yield) and 75% payout post 2020 3) potential earnings upside if the favorable
VAT rebate policy gets extended Management will host a call at 900 am on 1

In 9M17 Yangtzes nancial cost was lowered by 12% yoy to Rmb44bn with
stable net gearing at 110% Eective interest rate was lowered by 03ppt to 44%

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
aected by the currency of an underlying security eectively assume currency risk
