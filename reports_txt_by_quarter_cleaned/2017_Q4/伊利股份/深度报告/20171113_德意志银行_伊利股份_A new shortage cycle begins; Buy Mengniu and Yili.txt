A dairy farms raw milk prices in different cycles
2016 (oversupply)
2017 (balanced supply) 2018 (undersupply)
MengniuYili
Source Deutsche Bank based on channel check in a north dairy
on estimated for illustration purpose
We expect the dairy sector to enter an undersupply cycle from 2018 In this
their closer relationship with dairy farms Mengniu and Yili should be able to
gain market share faster in the next three years Meanwhile rising raw milk
cost could be mostly offset by lower selling expenses and price increases as
we have seen in past cycles We expect continued re-ratings for Mengniu and
Yili within the new cycle and we reiterate Buy on both
The undersupply and oversupply cycles of the past six years
The dairy sector experienced an undersupply cycle in 2011-13 and an
oversupply cycle in 2014-16 During the undersupply cycle Mengniu and Yili
posted 13% and 17% sales CAGR driven by market share gains as smaller
players had to source raw milk at a higher price Yet operating margins for
growth slowed down to high-single digit CAGR because oversupply resulted
milk at a much lower price For Mengniu and Yili the cost savings at a lower
milk price are mostly offset by rising selling expenses
Entering a new undersupply cycle in 2017-19
After three years capacity reduction on upstream from 2H14 the sectors
supply is rebalancing with demand from 2017 Given it takes two years for a
calf to grow up to be a milkable cow we expect the shortage cycle to continue
in 2018-19 Similar to the previous shortage cycle in 2011-13 we expect both
Mengniu and Yili to gain more market share in 2017-19 Actually Mengniu
Yilis sales growth recovered to double digits in 3Q17 faster than industrys
mid-single-digit growth Meanwhile we expect Mengnius and Yilis margins
to expand in 2018-19 as the rising raw milk price will be fully offset by lower
selling expense fewer price discounts and potential ex-factory price hikes
The cycle is just beginning reiterating Buy on Mengniu and Yili
Mengniu and Yili have rallied 44% and 74% YTD driven by the early signs of
industry recovery We think the recovery is a structural trend for the next three
years and expect the two names to continue to deliver sustained sales growth
We raise our target price for Mengniu to HK268 and our target price for Yili
to RMB350 based on DCF method (factoring in 39% RFR 56% ERP 10 beta
debt-free structure and 2% terminal growth) The next catalyst will be their
result reporting dates Downside risks food safety and oversupply

Mengniu and Yilis sales growths are recovering from 2017 after two years
weak growth The market generally believes this is due to a recovery in dairy
demand However we believe this is more because of changing raw milk
supply cycles We expect the dairy sector to switch from an oversupply cycle
to an undersupply cycle from 2017 In the new cycle small brands will face
increasing raw milk cost and losing market share to large brands We expect
the undersupply cycle to be sustained into 2018-19 which should lead to
faster market share gains for Mengniu and Yili
We are raising our earnings forecasts for Mengniu and Yili and lifting our
target price for Mengniu to HK268 and our target price for Yili to RMB35
both based on DCF approach We reiterate Buy on the two stocks

The historical milk supply cycles
Unlike most other staples segments dairy names operations are highly
affected by the supply situation of the upstream dairy farms Raw milk the
major raw material of the dairy sector is cyclical in supply and has a very short
shelf life Meanwhile an oversupply or an undersupply cycle normally lasts for
two to three years because it takes two years for a newborn calf to grow up to
oversupply in 2H14-2016
Figure 4 Chinas raw milk supply cycle
and large brands (Mengniu and Yili) are better positioned than smaller brands
because large dairy names generally have long-term contracts and closer
relationships with upstream dairy farms For example Mengniu signed a 10-
year contract with China Modern Dairy in 2008 Meanwhile large brands have
a national raw milk sourcing network and can ship more milk from production
regions (north China) to consumption regions (south and east china) Large
brands tend to gain more share in the cycle
During the 2011-1H14 undersupply cycle Mengniu and Yili recorded sales
growth of 13%17% in 2011-13 helped by market share gains (Figure 6)
Meanwhile though Yilis and Mengnius gross margins declined during the
period due to rising raw milk price their core OP margins expanded from
19%44% in 2010 to 85%59% in 2014 as the rising raw milk cost was fully
offset by fewer price promotions mix upgrade and a 5-17% price hike in 2013
and small brands are better positioned It is easier for small local brands to
source milk at a much lower price because dairy farms have strong incentives
to sell out all extra milk Dairy farms also sell milk directly to retail ends This
relationships and long-term contracts with large dairy farms large brands
cannot cut procurement volume immediately and revise down sourcing price
too aggressively

For example in 2016 a dairy farm we visited supplied MengniuYili at RMB35-
38kg but supplied its extra milk to smaller local brands at RMB2kg Yet
from 3Q17 the dairy farm was still selling to MengniuYili at RMB35-38kg
but selling to smaller brands at RMB39kg
During the 2H14-2016 oversupply cycle Yili and Mengniu saw a slowdown in
by declining raw milk price and product mix upgrade Yili and Mengnius core
OP margins changed by 10bps-260bps in 2014-2016 due to heavy price

Entering a new undersupply cycle
We expect raw milk supply to rebalance again from 2H17
National raw milk price has recovered from RMB34 in 2Q to RMB35 in 3Q17
According to cow magazines survey all of the 21 dairy farms in its survey
none of those farms limited production in October We believe this is a result
of capacity reduction from 2014

What will happen in the new shortage cycle
Within the undersupply cycle we expect a similar trend to the previous
shortage cycle to happen in 2018-19
First as large dairy players Yilis and Mengnius sales growth will
accelerate driven by faster market share gains This is because small
brands raw milk sourcing capability is weaker in this cycle Actually
Yili and Mengniu have shown such recovery from 2017  Yilis sales
growth accelerated from 04% in 2016 to 14% sales growth in 9M17
and we expect Mengnius sales growth to accelerate to double-digit in
3Q17 We forecast MengniuYilis sales to grow at 9%11% in 2017-
Secondly while gross margin will be under pressure due to rising raw
milk price most of this pressures could be passed on to consumers
through reducing price discounts at an early stage and raising prices
at a later stage For example a Shanghai distributor indicated that Yili
and Mengniu have raised the supply price of chilled yoghurt from 3Q
Yilis and Mengnius financial results in 9M17 also show this trend
and Mengnius core operating margins expanded 120bps in 9M17 and
190bps yoy in 1H17 respectively We expect MengniuYilis core EBIT
margins to expand by 400bps260 bps from 2017 to 2019

Figure 8 Mengnius and Yilis sales growth recover from 2017
Mengniu market underestimates its margin recovery
potential reiterating Buy
We forecast the dairy sector to register an 8% sales CAGR in 2017-19 driven
by 4% volume growth and 4% price increase each year Further helped by its
stronger position in raw milk sourcing we expect Mengnius market share to
expand by 2-4% from 2017 to 2019
Meanwhile we expect Mengniu to narrow its profitability gap with Yili helped
2016 and improving IMF operations helped by industry recovery (Refer to our
note Can Mengniu catch up with Yili for more details) We forecast
Mengnius recurring EBIT margin to expand from 61% in 1H17 to 70% in
We increase our earnings forecasts by 1-3% and expect a 31% recurring
earnings CAGR in 2017-19 We raise our target price to HK268 based on a
DCF approach (factoring in 39% risk-free rate 56% equity premium 10 beta
and 2% terminal growth) Our earnings forecasts are 1-6% higher than market
consensus In our view the market is still underestimating the potential of its
margin recovery We reiterate Buy The annual results announcement in March
will be next catalyst

Yili well positioned in shortage cycle reiterating Buy
In the near term we expect Yilis market share in ambientchilled products to
expand from 34%16% in 3Q17 to 38%20% respectively in 2019 helped by its
strong capability in raw milk sourcing Meanwhile we forecast its OP margin
will expand from 115% in 9M17 to 122% in 2019 helped by easing
In the long term we expect Yili to be an industry consolidator in the staples
sector helped by its stable and experienced management team strong
distribution network and good track record in new product launches We
expect it to deliver secular growth through market share gains category
expansion and MA
We raise our earnings forecasts by 1-3% and forecast a 16% earnings CAGR in
2017-19 We increase our target price to RMB35 based on a DCF approach

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
