新零售模式：借助云商平台重获控制权；强力买入（摘要）
很难想像一家企业要将近半盈利交予经销商，但贵州茅台就是这样。许多与我们交
流的投资者都认为其分销渠道拿走了过多的利润。茅台现在正在解决这一问题，方
法就是通过新零售模式来将一大部分销售转移至云商平台。我们认为这应该会
在中长期内给公司带来实实在在的益处，包括改善定价能力，平滑盈利增速，因为
在这种模式下供需更加匹配，并能带来新的收入机会。鉴于此，我们将目标估值倍
数上调至25 倍2021 年预期市盈率，并重申我们对于公司持续调整业务模式以及再
茅台已经成功地将茅台酒的消费主体从政府部门转至个人领域，但时至今日其分销
体系几乎未有任何变革，这影响了公司的定价能力、稳定价格以及有效调整供应的
能力，使之难以真正了解最终消费者并阻碍了公司进军新市场。
不过，现在公司的新零售模式强制性要求分销商将手中30%配额放上茅台云商平
台，这将加强茅台对于经销商的控制权，使公司能更规律地持续上调出厂价、挤出
经销商的过高盈利并显著提升自身盈利水平。在我们的两个持续提价情景下（每年
上调10%15%），估值将提升约每股211311 元。
新零售模式还能更好地匹配供需、提高透明度，帮助公司了解最终是谁、在哪里购

Moutais distribution conundrum
Having successfully navigated the transition from chiefly government-driven consumption to
private consumption Kweichow Moutais earnings are in many ways still captive to its distribution
channels 90% of its product is sold by third parties via franchise distributors and franchise stores
three key challenges First the retail price of Moutai is volatile with distributors acting not
only as intermediaries but as speculators hoarding bottles of the spirit as prices rise and then
offloading them as prices start to fall accentuating price movements in each direction Second
Moutai finds it tough to raise its ex-factory prices (ie those charged to distributors) in a
consistent fashion because of volatile end-prices Third it has limited information about the
end consumers of its product hamstringing tailored promotion and brand building efforts In
recent times with rising retail prices for the premium beverage this dynamic has led to an
outsized proportion of the margins available accruing to distributors Of a Rmb1500
bottle of Moutai bought in the high street Kweichow Moutai takes gross profit of c Rmb760
Distributors Rmb580 and Retailers Rmb100 This profit accruing to Distributors seems
disproportionately large and their gross margin (currently at 45%) is certainly way above the
historical average of 23%

Summary Leveraging E-Commerce to boost and smooth earnings
Kweichow Moutai announced in August 2017 that distributors and specialty stores should sell at
Rmb1299bottle The strategy worked well to alleviate short term rising pressure on Moutais
retail price Also in mid-November management indicated this policy will continue in 2018 and
might be optimized according to industry news agency Jiuyejia (Nov 9)
More importantly however we think the new model will bring long-term positives in addressing its
distributor conundrum — including better pricing power more stable retail prices more price
hikes to tap a larger profit pool and more revenue opportunities by harvesting data on consumer
demand That said since there is limited visibility on exactly what the effects of the strategy will
be on earning we do not yet revise our earnings
However we do give Moutai credit for the improvements in pricing power and earnings visibility
set out below  raising our target multiple to 25x from 23x We also roll forward by
discounting 2021E PE back to 2018E (previously discount back to 2017) Our 12-month target
price rises 18% to Rmb881 To frame the opportunity if Moutai can fully leverage its strategy we
also set out two bull case scenarios for sustainable price hikes over the next four years The
first assumes a 10% annual price hike  offering a further Rmb211 to valuation and the second a
15% annual price hike  offering Rmb311 on top of our base case valuation  Blue Sky We also
provide a case study of Hermes as a manufacturer of scarce luxury goods with strong pricing
power which has traded at an average 33x forward PE over the past 10 years and has seen
consistent earnings growth
Key benefits of the new retail model
Under Moutais new 30% quota for products to be sold online price is determined by Moutai
(Rmb1299 now) This stabilizes retail prices and assists demand It also provides better data on
customer orders allowing better matching of supply with demand and providing less room for
locations of consumers so that it can adjust its sales quotas in different regions more efficiently It
can better adjust order execution shipment and even product packaging timing based on online
regularly in future thereby boosting earnings
Expanding the revenue pool
With better demand-supply matching more untapped demand can be fulfilled and there should be
fewer shortages due to regional misallocation Fake Moutai sold by third party imitators can also
be replaced with the real thing as products sold online via its Cloud platform are supplied by
distributors certified by the Moutai Company — giving consumers greater trust in these products
and boosting demand
Access to big data on consumers
The move online should boost the number of individual customers as fewer bottles can be
online customers to reach 3mn from the current 250k This will allow Moutai to get a better
picture of its customers and allow it to tailor its product and marketing based on consumers
preferences This will be particular so among the younger demographic (25-35 yrs old) who make
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
Investment case in a nutshell  Reiterate Buy (CL)
We reiterate our Buy (Conviction list) on Kweichow Moutai on several key drivers (1) sustainable
high end spirit demand growth driven by rising numbers of people in the affluent and upper
years due to limited base spirit available which drives upside to ASP and (3) higher earnings
visibility and pricing power thanks to the new retail model
Key catalysts to watch in the next few quarters include the annual distributor meeting on 18th
December where management might shed more light on plans for 2018 We also think 2017
operating results are also key to watch (2016 operating result were out Dec 23 2016)
Dissecting Moutais sales channels and profit pool
Distribution dominated by franchisees
Kweichow Moutais current sales channel consists of a distribution layer and a retail layer where
distribution channel There are four main distribution channels The biggest two accounting for c
90% of Moutais revenue in 1H17 are
(1) Franchise distributors who are the main distribution channel
(2) Franchise stores Some franchise stores are owned and supplied by franchise distributors
1600 franchise stores
1% of revenue was from the B2C model
only 30 self-owned stores we estimate that revenue contribution from this channel is only 1% of
total revenue
(5) Offline direct sales including customized products through Moutai Customization Company
and sales with permission notes written by management and sold directly at the distillery These

Who buys Moutai
Apart from individual consumers the other main major type of consumer is group buying
referring to corporate customers who tend to buy in larger volume Group buying customers tend
to purchase directly from distributors or franchise stores at group sale prices which are at a
discount to the retail price According to our channel checks group buying accounts for 60-70%
of Moutais sales mostly corporates

Distributors taking an outsized chunk of the profit margin
With wholesale and retail prices of Feitian Moutai has risen significantly in the past year but the
ex-factory price unchanged distributors of Moutai are earning huge margins
guided retail price of Rmb1299 which is Rmb480 above the ex-factory price
In the offline channel distributors sell Feitian Moutai at the wholesale price which is about
Rmb1400 currently Rmb580 above ex-factory price We estimate the distribution system earns a
total gross profit of Rmb287bn or about 63% of Moutai spirit gross profit We estimate that
distributors earn total net profit of Rmb205 bn or about 92% of Moutai spirit net profit in 2017

does Historically the average distributor GP margin was 23% whereas it is now 45% We expect
September 2018
However more importantly the key to its ability to raise its ex-factory price consistently
will be its move into the cloud — which distributors may find hard to resist We explain this in
detail in the next section
We think Moutai will be able to successfully build out its new retail model as already more than
2800 distributors and specialty stores (ie the vast majority) have joined the Moutai Cloud
Platform and we expect more will in future  including new distributors This huge number of
sales network
Competitors would find it nigh-on impossible to replicate Moutais distribution network in our view
because of Moutais outsized bargaining power vs distributors due to its strong brand image

New retail model set to change the balance of power
We think its New Retail Model will over time allow Moutai to wrestle back control
over pricing  paving the way for sustainable capability to increase ex-factory prices
and smooth earnings
Moutai successfully navigated the transition to building a customer base driven by private
consumption rather than one driven by government consumption However its sales channel has
not been updated  until now
Distribution channels in need of refreshment
The current distribution model has three main disadvantages
(1) Moutai still relies heavily on distributors meaning it has limited visibility on the inventory in the
distribution network and can exert only limited control over wholesale and retail prices
(2) Big customers and speculators tend to stockpile inventory when the price is rising which can
make it difficult for general consumers to get hold of a bottle Moreover when the price starts to
fall speculators offload their stock —accentuating price volatility on both the way up and the way
down (Exhibit 11)
(3) Moutai has little information of who bought Moutai and on consumer characteristics  meaning
it finds it difficult to tailor its marketing and promotion efforts
E-Commerce provides the tonic
claiming back a larger share of the profit pool from distributors
That said we think it is too early to build in any direct effect on earnings yet  but we do give
Moutai credit for the improvements in pricing power and earnings visibility raising our target
multiple to 25x from 23x
In the following pages we first explain Moutais new strategy and then set out the potential

Moutai Cloud the cornerstone of Moutais new retail strategy
Moutai announced in Aug 2017 that distributors and specialty stores should sell at least 30% of their
remaining quotas for 2017 through Moutai Cloud at a price of Rmb1299bottle The strategy worked
well to alleviate short term rising pressure on Moutais retail price but has much deeper and long term
implications on Moutais channel strategy in our view
stores to enable faster and more efficient fulfillment of online orders At the same time
distributors registered on the platform are endorsed by Moutai Company and therefore may
appear more trustworthy to consumers Consumers can order online and get the product as soon
as possible they can get the product in the mail or pick it up at nearby distributor stores
because through this platform Moutai is able to move a significant portion (30%) of its sales
online (vs only 2-3% online penetration rate of alcohol in China)
Key benefits include obtaining more consumer preference data for analysis making channel
pricing power We elaborate on the benefits in the next section

this might rise to Rmb255bn for 2018 If we factor in other online sales conducted by distributors

How moving online will benefit Moutai
(1) Increase control over and stabilize channel prices
As discussed above Moutais wholesale and retail prices have been volatile — chiefly because it
has exerted little control over distributors inventory levels When the retail price of Moutai is
trending up distributors tend to stockpile inventory in expectation of price appreciation When the
retail price declines distributors tend to dump their inventory and precipitate the price decrease
We think Moutais new retail model will fundamentally change this situation For the 30% quota
has data on customer orders future distributor quotas can be allocated based on actual demand
 rather than that reported by distributors (who have an incentive to over-order) — allowing
supply to be better matched to demand and allowing much less room for stockpiling
The effects are immediate When Moutai announced on Aug 14 2017 that distributors should sell
from Rmb1500 to Rmb1300-1400 in less than a month reflecting the effectiveness of the New
control on retail price would be even stronger
A note on Supply Adding new supply takes time as Moutai takes at least five years to reach
maturity Current supply is limited by the supply laid down at the beginning of the crackdown on
fruition only in three to four years time
(2) More flexible production and distribution schedule
allocate each distributors annual quota ex-ante Distributors place orders monthly while the
We think this model tends to mismatch supply and demand For example if we look at the annual
quota allocation plan in a certain year (we use 2012 as an example) Guizhou and Beijing were
the top two regions accounting for 15%10% of total sales volume Given that Guizhous GDP is
only 15% of Chinas total GDP (albeit the home of Moutai) we think that there might be some
B2Cplatforms
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
geographic locations of consumers so that it could adjust its sales quotas in different regions
more efficiently and (2) better adjust the timing of order execution shipments and even product
packaging based on online data
Exhibit 15 Moutais quota allocation by province 2012
Source Company data
(3) Access to big data building a nuanced picture of customers
We think Moutais new retail model will give Moutai access to big data on their consumers
allowing them to build a better picture of consumer profiles and better target their marketing and
promotion
By requiring distributors to allocate at least 30% of their quota on the Moutai Cloud E-
are usually limited to 2 or 5 bottles per order rather than bulk orders direct from
from the current 250k
based on individual consumers preferences
in future so it is very useful to understand their preferences now
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
(4) Improve channel efficiency
improve channel efficiency After joining the cloud platform distributors and specialty stores have
access to real time data on payment shipment and distribution
Distributors also have free access to ERPCRM system so that they can save cost related to
information system Furthermore distributors on the platform also have access to consumer data
and can therefore make more targeted sales promotions Also for distributors and specialty
stores being listed on the cloud platform is effectively an endorsement that can boost credibility
among consumers
(5) Expand the revenue pool for Moutai
We think Moutais new retail model might also expand the revenue pool of Moutai Not only can
untapped demand be fulfilled with better matching with supply but we also think shortages will be
less of a problem due to ironing out regional misallocation
Another happy by-product might also be replacement of sales of fake Moutai (of which there is a
great deal in our view) with the real thing Because products sold on the cloud platform are
supplied by distributors who are certified by the Moutai Company consumers should place
greater trust in these products - boosting demand
In addition by gaining more data on young consumers and understanding more about them the
tap into a rising consumer group
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
What the new retail model doesnt change
While the new retail model might have relieved some pressure on rising price for the beverage in
the short term it does not fundamentally change the situation of supply shortage over the next 2-
3 years — which is determined by strong demand and Moutais production capacity limit 5 years
ago (which will mature for consumption over the next couple of years)
customers make up the majority of Moutais purchasers by volume meaning business
entertainment demand will be the chief driver of demand for moutai
In the long term we think moutais retail price should go up in line with the rising disposable
remain above the historic average (33x) in the next few years meaning the retail price will

Issues that still need to be resolved
products It is not necessarily logical for consumers to keep such an app on their phone when
easy to find out where to buy Moutai In addition consumers cannot buy in large volumes on the
app orders on the cloud platform are initially limited to 5 bottles (sometimes even only 2 bottles)
so most group buying customers would still need to go offline
To improve consumer experience Moutai is working with Alibabas cloud team to roll out a 20
add services — such as information on promotional releases and professional consulting services
(ie which drinks to select for entertaining clients)
Control over distributors is more difficult when prices are falling
Moutais control over distributors is more effective when the price is in an upcycle As demand is
adjust online price in line with offline price
Online-offline arbitrage
We learned through our channel checks that some distributors place orders on Moutai Cloud E-
sales online quickly and even arbitrage on the price gap between online and offline The
to improve its consumer identity certification process to cope with this problem
Balancing interests of distributors
A key consideration is not to alienate or over-penalize distributors As orders on the cloud
platform are dispatched automatically according to distance some distributors worry that they
code mechanism whereby a client can place an order on the cloud platform with a code supplied
by his distributor the order is then directed to that distributor In this way distributors can maintain
relationships with key clients that they might have had for many years As distributors are still the
main sales channel for Moutai its important to balance their interests However this mechanism
might also make it difficult for retail consumer to buy online as much of the online sales are taken
by large customers
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
Longer term options for building on E-Commerce
Expand product categories
As discussed earlier it makes little sense for consumers to use the Moutai app if only a limited
cloud platform like Guizhou Tea liqueurs etc In the future more product types could be added
creating more revenue source from existing consumer traffic and improving the consumer
experience Other products currently are few and made up only less than 5% of total sales in
2016 according to our estimate
Increase the quota allocated to the cloud platform
should be more influential as discussed above and Moutais control over retail price could
Increase the ratio of direct sales on the cloud platform
employing direct sales for incremental quotas in the future It might be possible that a certain
portion of orders on the cloud platform will be filled by Moutai itself bypassing the distributor
cut although it would incur distribution costs or need to build its own storage and distribution
system As such we think it would only be a rather long term prospect for a direct sales model to
get its products to market
larger share of the platform in order to consolidate it into its financials If this were the case it may
offer upside potential to the listcos earnings
Potential impact on earning and valuations
More stable earnings growth
We think Moutais new retail model has long-term positive implication for earnings growth
channel inventory and supply can be better matched to demand growth This will make the retail
steadily per year — basically with supply based on actual demand we believe there is less risk of
stockpiling meaning lower risk of eventual oversupply to the market smoothing out the peaks
and trough and allowing more stable prices and earnings growth
That said given the limited visibility on the effect of the new retail model on earning in the
forecast period we do not yet revise our earnings estimates However we do provide scenarios
that factor in annual ex-factory price hikes of 10% and 15% (see below)
More stable balance sheet and cash flow
In the upcycle distributors tend to make a lot in advances with the balance piling up as inventory
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
was unsold In the down cycle advances from distributors tend to decrease as product is
offloaded Therefore the balance of advances has also been very volatile
advances as quota execution and product shipment will be based on end-demand rather than
distributors own requests

Scenario analysis of price hikes
of the flow of product to distributors and of the wholesale and retail price of the spirit —  we think
light of the fat margins enjoyed by distributors at present
In our base scenario we assume an ex-factory price hike to Rmb999 (from Rmb819 at present) in
Sept 2018 and no more price hikes thereafter We show two bull cases in which we assume a
10% price hike each year from September 2019 and a 15% hike As there is finite supply of
Moutai due to production capacity limits five years ago we assume no fall in volumes sold as the
price rises So earnings are driven solely by price in our scenarios

Raising our valuation multiple to reflect Moutais greater bargaining power
We value the stock on long term PE discount back to 2018E (previously to 2017E) and raise our
2021 exit multiple from 23x to 25x (c 10% premium to industry average target exit multiple)
based on (1) Stronger pricing power based on the new retail model and potential for a bigger
profit pool from more regular price hikes (2) Higher earnings visibility with less volatility around
wholesale and retail prices (3) Higher returns (ROECROCI) than peers due to stronger pricing
power (4) Further transition to private consumption and (younger) millennials consumers -
leading to more sustainable growth in the long term
We therefore raise our 12-month target price 18% to Rmb881 as we roll over our target price
time frame and boost the exit multiple Our revised target price implies 34x 2018 PE and 25x

A note on our target multiple premium
In the last 10 years Moutai has traded at an average 7% PE premium to Wuliangye and Luzhou
Laojiao supported by higher growth (27% 2006-16 EPS CAGR vs 19% on average for
Wuliangye and Luzhou Laojiao) and higher ROE (34% 10-year average ROE vs 27%) in 2017-
21E we continue to forecast Moutai to lead peers in earnings growth (24% vs 22%) and ROE
(35% vs 25%) with higher pricing power and potential for price hikes With this in mind we set
our premium at 10%
Slower-than expected high-end spirit growth Macro economic slowdown could result in lower
a downside risk to our investment case
Tougher regulation on alcohol consumption If the government were to impose tougher and more
widespread policies on alcohol use by government officials or even by SOE employees (on official
business) there could be a dampening effect on high end alcohol demand
Potential pitfalls of the new retail model as mentioned above there are still some problems with
Moutais new retail model such as poor consumer experience of the app and ongoing speculation
by distributors If these problems are not solved the benefits of the new retail model would be

Case Study Hermes International  Blue sky dreaming
Should Moutai be able to successfully establish the new retail model and implement a full direct
sales model it would likely have even greater pricing power and be able to tap a much larger
profit pool by essentially cutting out the middle man entirely
To get a sense of the potentials benefits we look at Hermes International (NC) the high fashion
luxury brand in France Similar to Moutai the supply of Hermes Birkin bags is limited with prices
ranging upward from about US7000 per bag — due to the limited supply of raw materials
(animal skins) and the limited number of craftsmen able to create them
owns 307 retail stores worldwide  210 self-owned stores and 97 concessionaires The
speculators to stockpile inventory
on the back of growing demand Revenue growth at Hermes has been very stable (13% CAGR
financial crisis in 2008 reflecting its ability to smooth revenue growth Earnings growth was also
very stable (15% CAGR in 10 years)
We think very strong pricing power and steady earnings growth contribute to Hermes premium
valuation multiple Hermes is currently traded at 36X 12-month forward PE in the last 10 years
In terms of key financial metrics Moutai has much higher gross margin and net margin as
have similar ROE

投资摘要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与其行业和市场相比较来评价该股的投资环境。所描述的四个主要指标包括增长、回报、估值倍数和波动性。增长、
回报和估值倍数都是运用数种方法综合计算而成，以确定该股在地区研究行业内所处的百分位排名。
每项指标的准确计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法如下：
增长是下一年预测与当前年度预测的综合比较，如每股盈利、EBITDA 和收入等。 回报是各项资本回报指标一年预测的加总，如CROCI、平均运用资本回报率
和净资产回报率。 估值倍数根据一年预期估值比率综合计算，如市盈率、股息收益率、EVFCF、EVEBITDA、EVDACF、市净率。 波动性根据12 个月的历史
波动性计算并经股息调整。
在我们的全球覆盖范围中，我们使用并购框架来分析股票，综合考虑定性和定量因素（各行业和地区可能会有所不同）以计入某些公司被收购的可能性。然后
我们按照从1 到3 对公司进行并购评分，其中1 分代表公司成为并购标的的概率较高(30%-50%)，2 分代表概率为中等(15%-30%)，3 分代表概率较低(0%-
15%)。对于评分为1 或2 的公司，我们按照研究部统一标准将并购因素体现在我们的目标价格当中。并购评分为3 被认为意义不大，因此不予体现在我们的目
