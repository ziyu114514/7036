圣邦股份 (300661SZ)
有望实现长期稳定的盈利增长；首次覆盖评为买入 (摘要)
圣邦股份是中国第二大模拟半导体设计公司，在物联网、电动车和AMOLED 领域
拥有2000 多家客户和1000 种产品。我们预计圣邦将通过下列方式继续从海外同
业手中赢得市场份额并实现盈利：1) 满足庞大的本地客户群的需求；2) 依靠其在
国内市场上的差异化技术优势；3) 利用模拟半导体市场较为分散的特征（与规模
更大的同业矽力杰相似）。我们认为该股股价尚未反映公司的长期增长潜力。我们
首次覆盖圣邦股份给予买入评级，12 个月目标价格人民币116 元，上涨空间
圣邦自2015 年以来大力投资于研发，2018 年50 种新产品将实现上量（用于物联
网的低功率电源管理芯片(PMIC)、电池PMIC 和AMOLED 驱动器）。我们预计
2017-21 年圣邦的收入年均复合增速将达到23%的强劲水平（2017 年预计同比增
速为17%），但仍低于矽力杰2013-15 年间规模与之相似时50%的增速，归因于
圣邦的研发投入密度较低以及产品结构有所不同。
我们使用长期贴现市盈率以体现圣邦的长期增长潜力，由此得出12 个月目标价格
人民币116 元：40 倍的2018 年预期市盈率同业均值乘以2021 年预期每股盈利并
贴现回2018 年，隐含的2018 年预期市盈率为57 倍。虽然目前圣邦股价隐含的
2018 年预期市盈率为46 倍（基于我们的预测），而A 股半导体同业均值为40
倍，我们认为这一溢价与美国模拟半导体股票相对于半导体设计股票30%以上的
溢价基本一致。尽管圣邦当前估值较高，我们认为隐含的2018 年预期市盈率目标
57 倍有望实现，因为公司将：1) 利用其多元化产品组合；2) 实现产品结构改善；
并且(3) 在分散的模拟半导体市场上攫取市场份额。
1) 中国模拟半导体企业之间的竞争加剧。2) 新产品推出延迟。3) 由于高度依赖台
积电而面临供应链风险。

SG Micro No 2 player in Chinas analog device market
Founded in 2007 and based in Beijing SG Micro specializes in analog IC design and sales It has
two main product lines PMIC (power management IC) and signal chain which are widely used in
industrial automation and IoT devices (eg sharing bikes) SG Micro has a diversified portfolio of
ADI and Maxim
We are positive on SG Micros growth outlook for the following four reasons
Compared with its overseas peers SG Micro has many local customers to provide
superior service and time-to-market design enjoys abundant supply of junior engineers
and has a high valuation level in the A-share market to facilitate its potential acquisition
Analog is a fragmented market where smaller players can take share and remain
profitable Richtek and Silergy are such examples For more on Chinas semiconductor
design industry see our report Design and Conquer  in both new and traditional
markets Buy SG Micro published on November 13 2017 While SG Micro has less than
over 2012-2016 We expect SG Micro to continue the growth with a CAGR of 27% in
2017E-2021E driven by increased production and margin improvement from new
products launches
SG Micro offers a relatively more differentiated technology and product portfolio than its
Chinese peers It leads in low power high current and high precision analog design
chain products The revenue breakup between PMIC and signal chain products is 57%
and 43% as of 1H17 respectively
The Chairman and CEO of SG Micro Dr Zhang Shilong has a track record in analog
RD over the past 20 years He has previously worked as an engineer in top analog
firms in the US including Burr-Brown and TI and was also recruited by the Chinese
government through the Thousand Talents Plan (the Recruitment Program of Global
Experts by China) To maintain its technology advantage over peers we believe a low
attrition rate of employees especially senior engineers is critical in an analog
semiconductor industry SG Micro has had a very low employee turnover rate of below
total shares are owned by employees while 46% is owned by Dr Zhang and
shareholders acting in concert  We think having an experienced leader at the head of an
experienced and stable team should stand SG Micro in good stead to gain analog
Our 12-month target price of Rmb 116 is based on long-term discounted PE of 40X derived from
2018 average Wind consensus PE of A-share semiconductor design peers applied on 2021E
EPS and discounted back to 2018E using a peer average COE of 113% implying a 2018E PE
of 57X SG Micro is trading at a 465X 2018E GHe PE vs China A-share peer (Wind consensus)
average of 40X We note that analog stocks often enjoy a valuation premium over other
in the US analog stocks have over 30% higher 2018E PE and 600bps lower growth rate than
other semiconductor design (Exhibit 3) Hence SG Micros valuation premium over other A-share
semiconductor stocks is justified in our view We believe the stock will trade further up to our
implied target multiple of 57X 2018E PE given its diversified portfolio improving product mix with
higher margins and  continually increasing market share while retaining its technological
advantage
圣邦股份 (300661SZ)
We initiate SG Micro with a Buy rating and upside potential of 23%
Exhibit 3 Our PE premium of SG Micro over its A-share peer is largely consistent with the
PE premium of over 30% of analog stocks over other semiconductor design stocks in US
Note ADIs EPS CAGR is not included as growth is distorted by its acquisition of Linear Technology in 2017
Pricing as of November 09 2017

Key risks to our view include
sizable Chinese analog names and while the market is fragmented we view the potential
2) Delay in new products launch SG Micros new products should have higher gross margin if
the launch delays or sell-through is below our expectations the margin recovery road (to global
peers average level) will be challenging
3) Supply chain management risk TSMC provides 99% of wafer supply to SG Micro and SG
Micros new products with better cost structure will also rely on TSMCs advanced technology
Although SG Micro is actively looking to cooperate with other suppliers any capacity issue from
reliance on wafer supply from TSMC

Product overview A diversified portfolio of PMIC and signal chains
SG Micro has two main product lines namely PMIC and signal chains representing 60% and
1000 products According to Gartner PMIC had US102bn TAM in 2016 similar to signal chain
TAM of US103bn but signal chain products tend to have a longer life cycle and more stable
chain business SG Micro has accumulated technology and new designs in its PMIC business in
the past two years and expects its PMIC business growth to surpass that of signal chain in 2017-
Exhibit 4 SG Micro generated 60% and 40% of its total revenues from PMIC and signal chains in 1H17 respectively

SG Micro sells most of its products through distributors to over 2000 diversified end-customers it
sells directly only to ZTE SG Micros distributor partners are well known in China and include
Beigaozhi Colorbeam Linpo Kei Kong etc The top-five distributors contribute around 62% of
revenue While SG Micro works directly with end-customers for design-in its distributors fill the
orders and handle logistics
The smartphone sector represents 40% of SG Micros total revenues today but it is aiming for the
smartphones consumer and autoindustrialsmedicals sectors to represent around 30% each in
the near future
SG Micro sources 99% of its wafers from TSMC the worlds leading foundry and relies on JCET
TongFu and Unisem for packaging and testing

most of its peers due to its new entrant status in the China market and lack of cost advantages
purchase wafers as well as packaging and testing services which are more expensive than
internal productions at most overseas IDM (integrated design manufacturing) peers Despite its
high-margin signal chain products SG Micro has lower margins than Silergy because Silergy has
a proprietary wafer manufacturing process that can reduce PMIC wafer cost by 20% relative to
TSMCs generic process However SG Micro has said that TSMC has recently launched an
180nm analog process that offers a similar cost structure as Silergys in-house process we
expect the cost structure to improve over the next two years assuming Silergys cost structure
remains in a steady state In addition SG Micro indicated that its new products tend to have
higher margins so that as its new product increases in the mix its margin should improve
gradually into 2018 and 2019 We expect around 100bps improvement in gross margins through
2019E (vs 3Q17)

Earnings analysis EPS CAGR of 27% in 2017E-2020E
Revenue and profitability Given its lower RD intensity and improving product mix we expect
SG Micros revenue growth to accelerate to 26% in 2018 from 17% yoy in 2017E and achieve a
23% CAGR in 2017E-2021E below Silergys organic growth CAGR of 50% when it was operating
in a similar scale in 2013-2015 In 2013-15 Silergy benefited from the rapid growth of the SSD
quick ramp-up with the right end-application Looking forward SG Micro plans to drive its growth
through PMIC design-in for IoT innovative devices (eg sharing bikes and Segway) and battery
SG Micros GPM increased to 45% in 1H17 due to a temporary reduction of low-margin
GPM to improve gradually as the mix of new products increases in the portfolio through 2018E-
2021E We expect its GPM to improve by 2ppt to 43% in 2021E from 41% 2018E and help drive
its EPS growth at 27% CAGR in 2017E-2020E

We expect SG Micros OPEX as a % of revenue to stay stable at c23% in 2017E-2021E given its
aim to continuously expand its product lines to narrow the gap with global leader TI and its net
margin to improve to 199% in 2021E from 176% in 2017E driven by GPM improvement and
from 149% in 2018E driven by continuous market share gains and net margin recovery
Balance sheet SG Micro has a strong balance sheet It has a very short cash conversion cycle
which averaged at 20 days in 2014-2016 below that of Silergy and On Bright at 92 and 107 days
respectively SG Micros inventory days were shorter (average of 90 days vs 103 and 95 days at
Silergy and On Bright) and its payable days were much longer (average of 96 days vs 34 and 65
days at Silergy and On Bright) We attribute SG Micros short cash conversion to its superior
supply chain management at its packaging partners and expect its cash conversion cycle to
remain healthy Although our earnings model does not factor in any potential MA in the future
we believe that the strong net cash position of over Rmb800mn by 2021E could potentially
provide solid support for SG Micro to acquire small and private Chinese analog houses of good
approach as a potential future strategy)
Capex We also believe SG Micro will maintain its capex at a low level as it has done in the past
given the nature of the fabless analog business model where the focus is on OPEX We also note
Revenue (LHS)
圣邦股份 (300661SZ)

Analog firm trading at a premium expect further rerating
We initiate SG Micro with a Buy rating and a 12-month target price of Rmb116 We value our A-
capture long-term growth For SG Micro we apply its A-share peers average 2018E PE of 40X
to 2021E EPS and discount it back to 2018 using a peer average cost of equity of 113% as
shown in Exhibit 12 Our target price of Rmb116 implies a 2018E PE of 57X and 23% upside
potential
SG Micro is trading at a GHe PE of 465X 2018E vs China A-share peer (Wind consensus)
average of 40X We note that analog stocks often enjoy a valuation premium over other
in the United States analog stocks are trading at a 30% premium to the average 2018E PE for
other semiconductor design firms while posting a growth rate that is 600 bps lower (Exhibit 3)
Hence we believe SG Micros valuation premium over other A-share semiconductor stocks is
justified
We believe our implied 2018E PE of 57X should be achievable in the next 12 months based on
the following reasons
We expect its new PMIC products with higher ASP to boost the earnings growth from
toward new applications with high margins such as automobiles medical equipment
industrial controls and IoT from its current high exposure to smartphone (40%-45% of
total revenues)
As one of Chinas leading analog brands SG Micro benefits from the trend of adopting
Made in China products by customers like Huawei and ZTE which we believe will help
and has a low turnover rate (below 5% since inception in 2007) A stable team is crucial

Introducing MA rank for SG Micro
Across our global coverage we examine stocks using an MA framework considering both
qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to
target price MA rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price
target and may or may not be discussed in research
assessment of (1) impediments such as shareholder structurepreferences industry
regulationsgovernment policies and takeover defense that could prevent a transaction from
occurring (2) qualitative factors including (i) attractiveness of technology (ii) attractiveness of
customers (iii) cost synergy potential (iv) otherintangible value and (3) quantitative factors
including (i) market cap and (ii) valuations For details of our Asia technology MA framework
see our report Pan Asia Technology Navigating the noise (6) Introduce MA framework update
roadmap dated July 4 2016 for details
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
When assessing potential impediments we take into consideration
(1) Major shareholder preferences We assume that shareholders with a 20% or greater stake
have a significant influence or a blocking stake and take into account any potential actions by
major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third party (hostile or otherwise) or
(2) Regulatory and or government policy impediments and
(3) Possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill
We assign a No qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are applicable and
a Yes qualification if these considerations do not apply
Qualitative assessment criteria
generating future value as well as its technological capabilities and intellectual property rights
We assign a rank of 3 if its technology is unattractive or moderately attractive 2 if it is
attractive and 1 if it is very attractive
product applications We also take customer retention and end-market exposure (including sales
channels) into account We assign a rank of 3 if its customer base and product applications are
unattractive or moderately attractive 2 if they are attractive and 1 if they are very attractive
3) Cost synergies We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for profit margin

valuation is significantly discounted We take into account differing valuation multiple ranges
Within this framework we assign an MA rank of 3 to SG Micro
Our MA rank of 3 for SG Micro mainly reflects its protective shareholding structure (nearly 46%
held by Chairman Mr Zhang Shilong and other shareholders acting in concert) Moreover
an acquirer rather than a target as the former would be a good way to quickly expand product
acquisitions as a strategy

投资摘要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与其行业和市场相比较来评价该股的投资环境。所描述的四个主要指标包括增长、回报、估值倍数和波动性。增长、
回报和估值倍数都是运用数种方法综合计算而成，以确定该股在地区研究行业内所处的百分位排名。
每项指标的准确计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法如下：
增长是下一年预测与当前年度预测的综合比较，如每股盈利、EBITDA 和收入等。 回报是各项资本回报指标一年预测的加总，如CROCI、平均运用资本回报率
和净资产回报率。 估值倍数根据一年预期估值比率综合计算，如市盈率、股息收益率、EVFCF、EVEBITDA、EVDACF、市净率。 波动性根据12 个月的历史
波动性计算并经股息调整。
在我们的全球覆盖范围中，我们使用并购框架来分析股票，综合考虑定性和定量因素（各行业和地区可能会有所不同）以计入某些公司被收购的可能性。然后
我们按照从1 到3 对公司进行并购评分，其中1 分代表公司成为并购标的的概率较高(30%-50%)，2 分代表概率为中等(15%-30%)，3 分代表概率较低(0%-
15%)。对于评分为1 或2 的公司，我们按照研究部统一标准将并购因素体现在我们的目标价格当中。并购评分为3 被认为意义不大，因此不予体现在我们的目
