We reiterate our Buy rating on Hikvision and raise our target price to CNY43
from CNY345 as we raise our earnings forecast and lift the target multiple to
30x from 25x driven by our expectation of accelerated earnings growth due to
margin expansion
Better-than-expected margin expansion and outlook
We have been highlighting Hikvisions margin expansion through a rising
solution business and management efforts 3Q17 GPM of 46% is a high since
2015 above DBconsensus expectations of 42% As Hikvision continues to
pursue solution business opportunities in overseas markets and its domestic
margin expansion into 20182019 at 44%
Hikvision recently announced its AI cloud framework at the 16th public
safety expo in Shenzhen Its strategy focuses on edge cloud for video
surveillance applications which allows faster responses and the filtering of
unnecessary data from videoimages captured by millions of cameras
constantly In addition to domestic transportation and security projects
Hikvision has won a smart city project in Singapore of over USD10mn The
increasing adoption of AI presents upside risks to revenue and margins
Positive progress in the innovation business
In addition to AI the innovation business is a growth catalyst at Hikvision The
largest contributor is Ezviz whose subscribers exceed 20mn In addition to a
consumer client base it has business clients such as retail chain and property
monitor premises Its robot business has landed orders for three types of
innovation business to grow 142%83% in 20172018
Hikvisions share price has appreciated over 150% YTD (vs Shenzhen
Composite index 2%) We expect it to continue re-rating given accelerated
profit growth from AI exposure rising innovation contributions and margin
improvement Our new target price of CNY43 is based on 30x FY2018E PE
would be supported by an accelerated 34% profit CAGR in 2017-2019E
demand in industry project orders (see page 8-10 for details)

3Q17 results beat our forecast in margin expansion
Hikvisions 3Q17 revenue is in line with our forecast with 31% YoY growth
due to continual market share gains More importantly it delivered a strong
GPM of 463% (vs DBes 426%) in the quarter a significant improvement from
43% in 2Q17 and a record high since 2015 Management attributes the margin
improvement to management efforts and the growth of the higher-margin
solution business With an opex ratio decline due to scale 3Q17 operating
profit was 14% ahead of DBe at CNY28bn 55% QoQ and 32%YoY Lower
3Q17 profit was 6% of DBe at CNY29bn up 58% QoQ and 28% YoY arriving
at EPS of CNY031

New progress in industrial robots
sorting transporting and loading and industrial version solutions are provided
by Hikrobotics Technology a subsidiary of Hikvision At the sorting stage
Hikvision installed cameras on the robots arms to identify the bar code size
and shape of each package enabling the robots arms to grab the packages
more precisely The packages are then passed onto sorting robots and
delivered to different warehouse areas via address categorization Hikvision
provides the whole recognition system for these robots Hikvison Group
supplies the total solution including the robots body brain and eyes
apply to most other industries such as solar and manufacturing At the 3Q17
targeting the potentially enormous industrial robot market due to its low entry
in image recognition technology
Hikrobotics is part of Hikvisions innovation business Despite limited revenue

Rising contribution of solutions and projects to overseas
Hikvision has been expanding its overseas business given its lower market
share outside of China In 1H17 the overseas revenue contribution reached
30% with 38% YoY growth due to share gains The overseas business is able
Moreover management targets to increase the contribution of projects and
solutions to its overseas business as they generate better margins and are
closer to end-demand We believe management has devoted additional
resources and set up more offices to target the solutionproject business Its
contribution to overseas business increased to 30% in 1H17 from under 20% in
2016 Management noted a recent order win for a smart city project in
Singapore of over USD10mn one of the largest AI smart city projects in South-
east Asia
Given lower market share and management efforts to expand the overseas
market we expect the growth of the overseas business to outpace domestic
the overseas business with its rising projectsolution exposure will be margin
accretive to Hikvisions overall margin profile

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
