Pyrotinib P2 data better than Kadcyla
Pyrotinib data much better than T-DM1 and lapatinib
from Hengrui management We believe it is highly likely Pyrotinib would be the
golden standard in 2L Herceptin relapsed HER2 positive BC in China To us
this is the second meaningful oncology clinical study from China ever as trial
design followed a reasonable treatment paradigm that is NOT full of Chinese
characteristics After data release at SABCS we have higher conviction that
pyrotinib will be approved by CFDA based on P2 data
We highlight our views in the following
Among trastuzumab relapsed patients HR was 0374 while mPFS has
not been reached in PC arm vs 71m in LC arm The baseline PFS data
seemed to be in line with historic data (64m from EMILIA 7m from S Gori
2016) The yet-to-be-reached mPFS should be more than 21m according
to the data release
EMILIA study showed a PFS benet of 96m for T-DM1 vs 64m for LC
with a HR of 065 Our surprise came from a gap of 21m vs 96m If these
standard in 2L BC
Previous studies indicated that TTP (from 1L Herceptin treatment) could
be a predictive marker for PFSOS benet second-line HER2 inhibitors
In this study prior treatment of trastuzumab is associated with a longer
mPFS (71m vs 56m for trastuzumab naive) for LC arms data were also
consistent in PC arms In our view this should raise a serious question
for Chinese regulators regarding the relevance of clinical data from those
studies specically designed for Chinese patients today who did not
follow NCCN treatment guidelines
The additional questions include whether pyrotinib could be used in
1L BC or adjuvant setting or used o-label in GC For the rst two
questions we believe further data are required That being said for GC
setting despite the failure of T-DM1 (GATSBY study 2L GC) and lapatinib
(EGF110656 1L GC) we gained reasonable condence that pyrotinib
might work based on impressive P2 data

Overview of phase 2 study
As of December 2017 128 patients were enrolled in the HER2 metastatic
breast cancer under open-label randomized parallel assignment setting Dosing
regimen in treatment arm is pyrotinib (400 mg QD) plus capecitabine (1000 mg
sqm BID) while control arm is lapatinib (1250mg QD) plue capecitabine (1000
mgsqm BID) The study were conducted among second line and beyond patients
also excluded patients previously treated with lapatinib neratinib or other HER2
TKIs Primary endpoint was ORR with PFS time to progression (TTP) DoR and
OR as secondary points
In addition pyrotinib is under development for NSCLC and gastric cancer which
are currently in phase 2 and 1 stage respectively We reiterate our peak sales
oncology franchise and solid academic promotion eorts
We summarize the key clinical data in the following gures

Notably among patients without prior Herceptin treatment the mPFS from PC
can also be reaped for patients with previous exposure to Herceptin treatment
The study suggest that pyrotinib exhibited PFS extension in PC arm vs LC arm
irrespective of prior trastuzumab treatments
Primary endpoint ORR registered at 785% in PC group vs 571% from control
group with P-value of 001 For the higher response rates exhibited from control
arm vs previous studies we attribute this to investigators assessment To be
fair the higher baseline ORR also represented a barrier for treatment arm to
demonstrate a statistically signicant benet
Summary of grade 34 adverse events
foot syndrome diarrhea neutrophil count decrease with 246% 154% 92%
registered in PC group vs 206% 48% 32% respectively in LC group Other
severe AEs include decreased appetite and multi-organ failure displayer similar
with capecitabine under MTD of 400mg QD

approved for rst line therapy of HER2 mBC according to the latest NCCN
guidelines The former was also approved in China while the latter is currently
conducting phase 3 clinical study in China with targeted enrollment of 240
for the drug
Kadcyla (T-DM1) and Tykerb (lapatinib) are the currently approved drugs for 2L
HER2 mBC treatments T-DM1 is another blockbuster developed by Roche which
308% for treatment and control arms As for lapatinib from Novartis it is an
aromatase inhibitor approved in 2007 by FDA for 2L treatment of HER2 mBC in
of 75 weeks vs 659 weeks from control arm In addition FDA also approved a
pan-HER TKI neratinib indicated for extended adjuvant treatment of BC among
early-stage HER2 patients

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
