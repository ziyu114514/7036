In-line quarter led by manufacturing
Solid OCF generation in 3Q17
Shanghai Pharma reported revenue  core prot of RMB333bn  685m in 3Q17
representing YoY growth of 79%  05% respectively moderating from 1H17
growth of 10%11% Growth in the distribution arm was dragged down by two
invoice policy and broad reform headwinds while anemic prot growth was due
to the high base last year from JV contributions The manufacturing segment
remained the bright spot with 22% growth in 3Q17 or 11% on an organic
basis Contributions from Vitaco and acquired assets in 3Q17 were approximately
RMB280m and RMB65m respectively We highlight the solid cash generation
inow in 3Q16 We maintain Buy on SPH-H on its valuation and growth outlook
Hold for SPH-A
Distribution decelerated while manufacturing continues to deliver
Pharma distribution registered a growth deceleration in 3Q17 registering YoY
to 7%5% in 1H172016 Executives expect to capture opportunities arising from
the outow of prescription drugs supported by the derivative business including
Margin expansion driven by higher DS contributions
in 3Q16 Gross margin expansion was driven by a growth acceleration at
DS and a lower contribution from the IDS segment OPM improvements are
largely attributed to lower sellingmarketing expenses and improving operational
eciency Going forward management expects nancing costs to trend upward
slightly on the back of an upward interest rate revision cycle AR and inventory
days in 3Q16 AP days increased from 83 days in 3Q16 to 100 days this quarter
suggesting enhanced operational liquidity despite reform challenges
Maintaining PT of HKD245 for SPH-H and RMB213 for SPH-A risks
We derive our target price from 165x 2018E EPS We believe SPH deserves a
slight premium for its high earnings visibility and future acquisition opportunities

3Q17 recap
We highlight the following key updates during 3Q17
Impact of two-invoice system Management expects the gradual
implementation to continue to exert pressure on its IDS segment while
the DS businesses are likely to enjoy above-industry growth and further
margin expansion We estimate the net loss to its IDS business could
be close to RMB10bn in FY2018 as reform implementation accelerates
Nevertheless GM is likely to continue to trend higher as the percentage
of DS increases in the next few quarters We remind investors that DS
IDS remain steady at c 70%  30% respectively
Distribution DS delivered signicant outperformance vs IDS in
achieved 8% 147% 243% in Anhui Hunan and Shaanxi provinces
respectively For Anhui in particular DS growth stood above 8% while
IDS recorded only 45% during the same period In the aforementioned
three provinces SPH achieved market share expansion as a result of a
favorable policy
Manufacturing business SH Pharma achieved organic growth
acceleration in its manufacturing franchise at 11% 7% 5% in
3Q17 1H17 2016 respectively Notably sales from Vitaco registered
RMB280m in 3Q17 while two more acquisitions from Gansu and Tianjin
generated RMB65m to the top line
On MA Shanghai Pharma is actively reviewing favorable targets for
acquisitions with the following selection criteria 1) an expanding
drugs or products with high entry barriers
Geographical breakdown Zero mark-up policy in Beijing reduced
overall ASP by 9-10% during Apr-Sep 17 and volume growth stood at
approximately 10% maintaining at YoY growth for Beijing revenue
Executives believe that the majority of the negative impact is already
reected in the rst few months Going forward SH Pharma expects
stable growth in the distribution arm from the Beijing region

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ows)
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus cause a loss
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax policies currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor the liquidation of positions) and settlement issues
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ows to ination to FX depreciation or to
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of the
proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Naturally
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors own circumstances
including their tax position their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities and as such
investors should take expert legal and nancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication The risk of loss in futures trading and options foreign or domestic can be substantial As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options at http
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors including the following ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large uctuations ( ii) the value of currencies may be aected by
numerous market factors including world and national economic political and regulatory events events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aect the value of the currency Investors in securities such as ADRs whose values are
aected by the currency of an underlying security eectively assume currency risk
