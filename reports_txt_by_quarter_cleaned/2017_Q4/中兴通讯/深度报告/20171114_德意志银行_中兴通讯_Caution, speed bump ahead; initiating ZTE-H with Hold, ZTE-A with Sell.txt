ZTE is well leveraged to grow in telco capex from 5G build-out starting in 2020
That said current global appetite for large 5G capex is limited while there is
stronger political support for 5G tech in China with limited application
opportunities we expect Chinese telcos to tread a middle path in the 5G build-
out Short term global telco capex is set to fall 5-7% pa although ZTEs
With ZTEs share price doubling YTD against a tough market backdrop upside
potential appears mostly priced in Hold ZTE-H and Sell ZTE-A
Limited applications to support a widespread 5G rollout
Global telcos have expressed reservations about 5G which likely reflect a
viable applications requiring nationwide 5G For many applications eg video
streaming and IoT existing technology suffices for others eg robotics needs
can mostly be met by regional 5G rollout For most global telcos around the
world we expect 5G networks to be deployed like islands in a sea of 4G
Stronger political support in China should see ZTE better placed
There is stronger political support for a 5G build-out in China with the
government aiming to make the nation a networking powerhouse Hence
Chinese telcos spend on 5G capex will likely be more than their international
peers Our bottom-up build suggests a total 5G capex in China of RMB15trn
to be spent from 2020 (twice the estimated 4G spend) which would lead to
cRMB19trn in total capex spending between 2020 and 2024 This would drive
a 30% lift in ZTEs China carrier revenue in 2020 and a further 15% in 2021
Opportunities in the near term but it is a tough environment
In the near term operating conditions for equipment vendors remain tough
with our global team expecting a 6-7% pa decline in telco capex (ex US) over
for share gains for ZTE ie teething integration issues and potentially
excessive pricing discipline at Nokia and poor profitability at Ericsson We have
assumed a 2-3ppt pa market share increase for ZTE in the Asia Pacific and
EMEA regions over the next three years to reflect these In China we see
limited opportunities for ZTE to gain further material share prior to 5G given its
already dominant position with a 30-35% market share in wireless equipment
Many of these factors are priced in with close to no upside potential for ZTE-A
While ZTE has put the litigation issues in the US behind it significant execution
trading in line with its peers (albeit expensive vs its own long-run average
12mth PE) and with ZTE-A valuation already implying a bullish scenario of
share gain margin lift and significant capex blowout in China (leaving little free
cash flow for the telcos) we rate ZTE-H a Hold and ZTE-A a Sell
PT based on mid-point of SoTP and DCF valuations (WACC 87% TGR 1%)
Upside risks 1) keen 5G applications and 2) govet push to drive 5G spending
Downside 1) share loss and 2) delays in formalizing 5G See pp 367

5G lacking viable business cases Telcos around the world are not
willing to increase capex significantly for 5G given limited viable
business cases and subdued growth
Better prospects for 5G in China The Chinese government is
supportive of 5G which will be helpful for ZTE However we do not
believe the level of spending will be overwhelmingly high We expect
5G capex in China to total RMB15trn over 10 years
Opportunities offsetting challenges near-term for ZTE In the near
term ZTE could benefit from issues at Nokia (integration) and Ericsson
(poor profitability) However it faces a declining market There has
also been limited evidence of market share gains outside of China
Valuation appears full ZTE-H valuation appears full while ZTE-A is
already factoring in a bullish 5G build-out scenario in China
Lack of enthusiasm for 5G globally
To date most telcos across the globe have been lukewarm towards 5G
Declining profitability and limited evidence of 4G monetization
cannot be discerned with the naked eye ARVR is still nascent
Existing technologies may be good enough in most cases eg
Massive MIMO for bandwidth and NB-IoT for IoT and
High cost involved in building a national 5G network given the higher
spectrum frequencies involved

Hence at this stage we expect 5G networks to be islands in a sea of 4G
Better prospects for 5G in China
We see better prospects for 5G investments in China due to strong
government support for the tech industry and its over-arching aim of making
the country an IT and networking powerhouse With that said we also see a
number of moderating factors including

We believe the government will likely factor in the needs of all stakeholders in
its considerations and given the limited global support for 5G we expect
Chinese telcos to be somewhat cautious in capex spending We estimate that
in aggregate Chinese telcos will likely spend RMB15trn on 5G over 2020-2030
a level sufficient for nationwide coverage by 2030 but not so exorbitant that
every corner of the country would be covered by high bandwidth 5G
The table below shows our forecasts of total 5G capex in China We have used
7m base stations as the basis for coverage achieved by 2024 which is based
on the current number of 4G base stations multiplied by two to account for the
higher frequencies used partially offset by the larger bandwidth offered
Our 2030 target assumes a higher number of base stations for improved
coverage and higher bandwidth needs offset by declining base station prices

5G as it stands is not a
Each change in mobile technology generation brings with it upgrades to
network functionalities and is typically a time for equipment vendors to
monetize their research efforts as new network equipment replaces the old
However as it currently stands 5G does not appear to be a blockbuster for
equipment vendors as 4G is good enough for most applications and few of the
applications currently would potentially require a nationwide 5G rollout
Furthermore many telcos around the world are struggling to generate growth
and hence do not have the financial appetite for a new wave of capex
particularly given the limited monetization benefits of their 4G investments
In this section we look at
The 5G criteria
Potential application scenarios and
Evidence of why global telcos are not keen on 5G
What is 5G briefly
From the first generation (1G) mobile technology to 4G each generation of
mobile technology has resulted in a substantial improvement in the way that
and 4G allowed significantly more data to be transmitted and 4G enabled
things to be connected

Each generation of mobile technology is also defined by different
generation of mobile technologies (5G) have yet to be formally defined
although there is some consensus on what 5G would be able to achieve The
GSM Association (which represents mobile operators interests globally)
identified a set of eight requirements for 5G technology as shown below

IMT  2020 (5G)
(Mbltsm2))
(deviceskm2)

Source Deutsche Bank ITU Figures for 5G are proposed at this stage and may change
The improvement in performance of 5G vs 4G revolves around three main
Improved data download speed (enhanced mobile broadband)
Peak data rate from 1Gbps to 10-20Gbps
1000x bandwidth per unit area
Reduce latency from 10ms to 1ms
(Perceived) 99999% availability
(Perceived) 100% coverage
Massive machine type connections
Improve energy efficiency tenfold
Allowing 10-100x number of connected devices in an area
Up to 10 years of battery life for low power machine type devices

It is worth noting that not all these requirements will need to be met at the
above requirements will be supported when and where it matters For
example it is unnecessary to have download speeds of 20Gbps for typical
industrial sensors but they may need to be run with low-energy usage and a
large number of them may need to be connected in a small area
5G will be for industrial internet eventually
While previous generations of mobile technology have significantly improved
consumer adoption and experience in using their mobile devices enterprise
applications of mobile technology have so far been limited It is hoped that 5G
will be a key enabler of many enterprise applications such as
Internet of things (IoT) which will require the large number of
connections afforded by 5G
Robotics (and tactile internet) which will be enabled by the precise
and low latency properties of a 5G network
devices such as sensors vehicles (eg self-driving cars) and
capabilities stored in data centers in remote locations
Figure 25 5G application scenarios

With enterprises being the dominant target customer group for 5G technology
it is hoped that telcos will be able to monetize their 5G network investments
better than in the past We suspect that typical conversations between telcos
and their enterprise customers will sound like these

Deutsche Bank AGHong Kong
We will save you 10m in labor costs by installing these sensors 
robots and each year we will charge you 100k for the network
usage a fraction of the costs saved
The driverless car costs 1m but it may need to upload 1000GB of
data usage a small fraction of the price of the car
These robotics arms installed for surgeonstechnicians will save them
10 trips a year for linking this service to the 5G network we charge
10k a year which is still cheaper than the 100k required for
travelling
For these reasons in the long run we see better monetization opportunities for
telcos under 5G than under 4G which mostly just improves the download
speed of mobile handsets without attracting new customers to mobile
operators

No current need for a widespread 5G rollout
While we share some of the excitement around what the future technology
may entail early application scenarios under 5G would merely enhance the
mobile broadband experience As it currently stands we do not see the need
for a 5G build-out at a similar pace or coverage to the 4G network since the
4G technology is good enough in some of these scenarios or the 5G
technology or application scenario is not sufficiently mature to require a
nationwide rollout We explore these factors below
9 November 2017

Deutsche Bank AGHong Kong
Existing 4G technology is good enough
The enhancement to the video viewing experience on a mobile phone
is limited when stepping up from HD to 4K8K given the small display
screen We suspect a 5G network is more likely to be used as a
stages of the build-out
Most of the IoT applications are likely to run on the NB-IoT standard
under 4G for some time In fact the 5G IoT standard wont be ready
until Release 16 in 2019
No need for a nationwide rollout of 5G network
Cutting-edge technologies such as robotics and e-health remain
expensive and can be satisfied by a limited rollout of the 5G network
focusing mostly on Tier 1 cities or specific regions and supplemented
by Wi-Fi and fixed broadband
will be reliant on the 5G network given improved processing power
and the significant litigation risks associated should accidents occur
While there is significant data upload needs for self-driving cars this
should be done when there is a 5G or Wi-Fi network available (eg in
city areas) Furthermore some sources indicate that the level of data
uploads could reach around 3000GB per day (eg CSIA) for a self-
driving car With the average fixed broadband user using only 20-
50GB per month other methods may need to be contemplated
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications will require
the support of a 5G network but its still early days for these
technologies With VR taking some time to take off despite the initial
launch hype we think some degree of skepticism is in order
Furthermore we expect the usage of AR and VR to be most likely
focused on city areas and the more affluent regions
A nationwide rollout of 5G network will be much more expensive than 4G
Currently typical 4G spectrum frequencies are 700MHz 900MHz and
1800MHz while the lowest frequency currently allocated for 5G is 3500MHz
As a rule of thumb the 1800MHz spectrum covers around double the distance
of the 3500MHz Hence to achieve the same level of coverage the number of
5G base stations required will be 3-4x Furthermore building a standalone 5G
network may require further significant investments in the fiber backhaul

There are some offsets the use of beam forming techniques can increase
propagation distance and given their higher bandwidth capacity 5G base
stations can reduce the number of base stations required in high-density areas
Furthermore some uncertainties remain around the spectrum to be used for
5G with different frequencies proposed by different countries Ultimately some
of the 2G3G spectrum in lower frequencies may be re-allocated to 5G later
Struggling telcos generally cautious about 5G spending
The investing intentions of telcos in the 5G era are generally subdued as telco
profitability and growth stall and with evidence of 4G monetization generally
limited for telcos

Upgrade path for 5G
There are two broad deployment scenarios for 5G networks standalone and
non-standalone A standalone network is newly built and includes new base
stations backhaul links and a core network while a non-standalone network
piggy-backs on the existing infrastructure (eg adding new aerials and
modules to existing base stations)
to GSMA operators in China are more inclined to take the standalone route
while operators in other countries are likely to opt for a non-standalone

benefit more than global equipment vendors We explore these issues our 5G
capex forecasts for China and its implications for ZTE below
Chinese telcos will likely tread the middle path on 5G capex
The Chinese government has long been supportive of the countrys technology
grants (ZTE for example receives RMB1bn in grants each year) This message
was reiterated at the recent 19th National Congress with the government
aiming to make China a global IT and networking powerhouse
The government would have also been proud of the achievements that Huawei
has made on the international stage and the countrys increased ownership of
government on Chinese telcos to invest earlier and at a larger scale on 5G than
international peers
That said we see some moderating factors including
The need to improve SOE returns the government wants to improve
SOEs returns and reduce unwanted supply and the reform actions at
international peers
One national champion is enough China has already had significant
success in promoting Huawei as a global powerhouse Hence there

The table below shows our forecasts for total 5G capex in China We expect
total 5G capex to be around twice that of 4G to reflect the higher frequency
offset by improving technology (eg higher propagation) and declining
equipment pricing over time

We forecast total 5G wireless capex spend of RMB15trn with an initial spend
of RMB08trn spread over the first five years on the following basis

Deutsche Bank AGHong Kong
Cost per 5G base station added of RMB115k broadly based on the
historical average spend per 4G base station added and CUs own
estimate of RMB100k to RMB130k per 4G base station
We assume a total of 7m 5G base stations being deployed over five
years based on 35m 4G base stations as at 1H17 (where the major
operators already have 85-95% 4G network coverage) multiplied by
two to account for the lower penetration of the high frequency 5G
spectrum partially offset by the larger bandwidth offered
We assume the number of base stations required doubles from 7m in
2024 to 15m in 2030 to account for increased data usage partially
offset by a decline in ASP due to improvement in technology

Our 5G capex forecasts are lower than CAICTs (a think-tank for the MIIT)
forecasts in their 5G White Paper (published in June 2017 and shown above)
particularly after 2022 We do not think the CAICT capex forecasts are
reasonable (particularly those beyond 2022) at the moment given the limited
number of use cases for 5G Applying such a hefty capex burden would imply
that the Chinese telcos would hardly generate any free cash flows in FY22-24
2-3 years after 5G launch when the telcos would have already tested the
waters in terms of user demand for the services

upgrade is assumed to occur at a constant pace and here we assume a 5%
pa increase in spend each year We forecast 2020 and 2021 being the peak
years in terms of total 5G spend averaging RMB200bn pa which is in line
with the peak wireless capex in 2015 While our total capex spend is less than
the 2015 peak this accounts for the following two factors 1) RMB28bn of the

Before the 5G build-out arrives the growth outlook is challenging with telco
capex set to fall in China and globally over the next 2-3 years That said with
ZTEs US regulatory issue having resolved and its European counterparts
looking to improve their profitability ZTE has the opportunity to lift its market
In the following section we look at the growth outlook in the next 2-3 years
before 5G arrives and we outline the various risks (both upside and downside)
that we see to ZTEs near-term earnings
Telco capex spend slowing
Globally we estimate that telco capex will decline 3-5% pa over the next two
years as the pace of 4G and fiber rollouts slows North America is the only
region where we expect to see a rise in telco capex however it is the region
where ZTE has the least potential for growth Excluding North America we
expect the capex of telcos in the other regions to fall 6-7% pa

opportunity for growth for ZTE would be via market share gains which we
explore in the following section
Market share gain opportunities
The equipment vendors have limited segmental disclosures around their
independent data sources are available differences still exist and the data are
often overly segmented and do not include a holistic picture of the providers
Hence we look at market share based on reported revenue by the equipment
On this basis ZTE appears to be slowly gaining share in China which is
leading to an increase in global market share while Huawei is the one that is
consistently gaining share from the other vendors

We do note that ZTE has lost share in the government and enterprise segment
which may be the result of recent regulatory issues as well as changes in their
strategy  ie moving away from package solutions to equipment sales only
Profit focus from the global peers providing an opportunity for share gain
We see some opportunities for ZTE to gain market share from the likes of
Nokia and Ericsson due to the following
Ericssons focus on return to profitability may see the loss of some
less profitable customers
Nokia bedding down its acquisitions of Alcatel may see some
customer attrition
ZTEs product and execution capabilities have improved Our channel
checks in China suggest limited quality difference in the 4G RAN
product between the top four equipment vendors
The Chinese government provides financial support to the equipment
vendors which allows ZTE to charge lower prices than the overseas

More share gain opportunities in EMEA and Asia Pacific
We see limited opportunities for ZTE to gain further material market shares in
China Our channel checks suggest that ZTE already has a 30-35% market
share in the radio access network business in line with Huawei While ZTEs
market share in optical equipment and routers are lower Huaweis dominance
in these markets may make any material market share gain more difficult
However there may be more opportunities in EMEA (Europe in particular) and
in Asia Pacific As shown below ZTE has less than 5% share in the EMEA
regions and has recently had some more high profile contract wins such as the
cooperation with Orange in its pre-5G trial and with Wind Italy in its 4G
deployment Meanwhile some of the Asian telcos are still rolling out their 4G
networks which provides some room for market share gains

Execution risks remain
Despite the upside from market share gains we do think significant execution
risks remain for ZTE to deliver on the above In particular ZTE has not shown
itself to be able to gain market share outside of China and Huawei may end up
scooping up more share as it has done in the past
Furthermore winning contracts in overseas markets may result in margin
dilution as ZTE uses pricing as a lever to get its foot in the door on some key
customers

We assume that ZTEs carrier revenue growth in China is relatively flat over the
next three years due to its high market share and as the domestic telcos capex
declines We have allowed for 2-3ppt pa market share in EMEA and Asia
Pacific for ZTE over the next three years which we believe is more than
adequate given its track record to-date

ROE of 10% or above

The existence of the share scheme could see ZTE selling off some of its core

its revenue growth As such this may see its share price supported at current
levels before more clarity on the 5G build-out emerges

Long-term disrupters SDN
little margin on the initial hardware implementation phase in the hope of
recouping the cost via future software upgrades which have significantly
higher margins
improve efficiency and flexibility This unbundling process however may
result in reduced profitability for the equipment providers as the more lucrative
dedicated software providers
headwind in the longer term as NFV and SDN are essential in enabling some
of the 5G functionalities (eg network slicing) Our European team led by Rob
Sanders has delved into this issue in significant detail for the European
equipment names in the note Telco Cloud  Resistance is futile We explore
the issue briefly in the following section
What are NFV and SDN
Network functions virtualization (NFV) was created in 2012 by telcos that were
frustrated as existing hardware had limited their ability to speed up
deployment of new services as the network functions are carried out by
embedded software in proprietary hardware NFV disaggregates software and
hardware with network functions being run in software via virtualization
server) This allows network resources to be divided into individual channels
which can operate independently enabling virtual applications to be quickly
hardware purchasing costs reduce opex and provides the ability to launch
services more quickly
Software defined networking (SDN) is a related concept that looks to promote
an open network architecture by centralizing the software that controls the
multivendor ecosystem that allow automation of IT tasks
flexible network architecture That said the virtualization of network functions
does not rely on SDN technologies and vice versa
9 November 2017

How could they disrupt value in the equipment vendors
For an equipment vendor like ZTE the implications are mostly negative
Until now equipment vendors have preferred to sell equipment as an
integrated device essentially as a closed black box They have then
managed the pace of upgrades with upgrades often the highest
margin sale within the customer lifecycle With NFVSDN the
operating system can be supplied by a third party or internally and the
hardware sales are likely to decline
The promotion of open standards means that vendors are not locked
in hence making it easier to switch vendors in the future
While software sales from equipment vendors may rise this is unlikely
to offset the loss from hardware sales Overall margin is likely to be
permanently depressed for the industry
As shown below DBs global team expects up to 20% revenue erosion from
NFV and SDN adoption by 2025

Attitude of the telcos
We do note that currently SDN is occurring at the core and backhaul level only
and the radio access networks (RAN) equipment are still sold as black
boxes That said a number of telcos have long-term goals of increasing the
penetration of SDNNFV in their network architecture which could see the
level of disruption increase over time
The following table below summarizes NFVSDN targets made by some of the
large telcos globally
Figure 79 Virtualization targets set by telco operators
75% network function virtualization from 5% in 2015
75% network function virtualization from 5% in 2015
80% of network to be software defined by 2025
50% network functions virtualized supported by SDN by 2020
Source Deutsche Bank Company Data
Our channel checks so far suggest that there remains some resistance to the
Difficulty in implementing SDN concepts at the base station level
A lack of visible cost savings due to the costs associated with renting
mini data centers to store the servers and additional maintenance
associated and
Lack of interoperability and issues integrating with legacy equipment
This issue is a risk for the likes of ZTE in the long run and is worth monitoring

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a
loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor the higher will be the
macroeconomic shocks to receivers But counterparty exposure issuer creditworthiness client segmentation regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors) changes in tax policies currency
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of profits andor the liquidation of positions) and
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered The sensitivity of fixed
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended
to track The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where floating coupon
rates (ie coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons It is
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are
denominated carries FX risk Naturally options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to
movements
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including among others market counterparty default and illiquidity risk
