公司为制冷剂行业龙头企业。公司氟制冷剂配额总量绝对领先，主流品种齐全且处于龙头地位，这是
公司的优势，拥有更大主动权和运作空间。公司将未雨绸缪，积极做好各种应对准备，努力创造更好
价值。公司目前R32 总产能19 万吨（本部13 万吨、山东飞源3 万吨、阿联酋3 万吨），在建3 万
吨，预计能够满足生产需求。
布局液冷及数据中心等高端应用领域产品。作为国内氟化工龙头企业，公司的发展定位不仅仅围绕液
冷市场发展某种冷却液，而基于对航空航天、军工、半导体、集成电路、信息产业和人工智能、新能
源等产业快速发展的预期，持续加大研发投入，加快高性能氟材料的产品研发和应用开发。为此，公
司在改性PTFE、电子级PFA、FEP、PVDF、全氟磺酸树脂等含氟树脂，氟橡胶（含过氧化物硫化
氟橡胶、全氟醚橡胶等），氢氟醚系列、全氟聚醚系列等产品均有产能布局。未来仍将加大研发创新，
加强新产品、专用品种、新应用等方面的研发。在数据中心领域，需要多种氟材料产品支撑。如专用
氟树脂作为电和信号导线、管线、覆铜板加工等材料应用，专用氟橡胶作为密封件应用。氟制冷剂作
为冷水机组应用或冷板式冷却液应用，R227ea 作为灭火剂应用，氢氟醚、全氟聚醚作为浸没式冷却
加快研发四代制冷剂产品。第四代氟制冷剂是公司当前及今后一定时期的发展重点。目前，公司第四
代氟制冷剂主要是HFO-1234yf、HFO-1233zd 品种。其中，HFO-1234yf 今年产能到1 万吨年，预
计可达满产水平。此外，甘肃巨化计划建成年产35 万吨HFO-1234yf（多工艺路线）。HFO-1233zd
受发泡剂市场影响，产销量不及预期。从目前的替代品开发路线看，在氟制冷剂中，主流并不是
HFOs 单工质直接应用并对HFCs 替代，而是同时含HFOs、HFCs 的混配产品。
氟制冷剂市场保持良好增长趋势。以目前最大的两个消费市场（家用空调和汽车）为例，根据国家统
计局的数据，2022 年至2025 年1-7 月，我国房间空气调节器、汽车产量持续增长。尽管近几年我国
房地产处于下行周期，但我国房间空气调节器产量仍稳定增长。2022 年222473 万台，同比18%；
万台，同比51%。
盈利预测。我们给予公司2025-2027 年归母净利润分别为451158216196 亿元。参考可比公司，
给予公司2026 年19 倍PE，首次覆盖给予公司目标价4104 元，给予收集评级。

Whats New
production capacity of 190000 tons (130000 tons in the local port 30000 tons in Shandong Feiyuan and 30000
tons in the United Arab Emirates) with 30000 tons under construction expected to meet production demand
Layout high-end application products such as liquid cooling and data centers As a leading domestic fluorine
coolant in the liquid cooling market but also on the expectation of rapid development in industries such as
aerospace military semiconductor integrated circuit information industry artificial intelligence and new energy It
continues to increase research and development investment accelerating the product research and application
for modified PTFE electronic grade PFA FEP PVDF perfluorosulfonic acid resin and other fluorine-containing
resins fluororubber (including peroxide vulcanized fluororubber perfluoroether rubber etc) hydrogen fluoride
ether series perfluoropolyether series and other products In the future we will continue to increase research and
development innovation strengthen the research and development of new products specialized varieties new
applications and other aspects In the field of data centers various fluorine material products are needed to support
it Special fluororesin is used as a material for electrical and signal wires pipelines copper-clad laminate processing
coolant R227ea is used as a fire extinguishing agent and hydrofluoroether and perfluoropolyether are used as
immersion coolant
Accelerate the research and development of fourth generation refrigerant products The fourth-generation
fourth generation fluorine refrigerants are mainly HFO-1234yf and HFO-1233zd varieties Among them the
production capacity of HFO-1234yf will reach 10000 tons per year this year and it is expected to reach full
production level In addition Gansu Juhua plans to build an annual production capacity of 35000 tons of HFO-
1234yf (multi process route) HFO-1233zd was affected by the foaming agent market resulting in lower-than-
expected production and sales volume From the current development path of alternatives the mainstream in
fluorine refrigerants is not the direct application of HFOs as a single working fluid to replace HFCs but a mixed
product containing both HFOs and HFCs
Whats Different
The fluorine refrigerant market maintains a good growth trend Taking the two largest consumer markets
currently (household air conditioning and automobiles) as an example according to data from the National Bureau
of Statistics the production of room air conditioners and automobiles in China will continue to grow from January
to July 2022 to 2025 Despite the downturn in Chinas real estate market in recent years the production of room air
conditioners in China has continued to steadily increase 222473 million units in 2022 a year-on-year increase of
18% 24487 million units in 2023 a year-on-year increase of 135% 265984 million units in 2024 a year-on-year
increase of 97% From January to July 2025 there were 183455 million units a year-on-year increase of 51%
Accumulate rating
Projects under construction did not meet expectations Refrigerant demand falls short of expectations
