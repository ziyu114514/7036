与瑞浦兰钧签订合作协议。2025 年 9 月 22 日，公司全资子公司九江天赐与瑞浦兰钧签订了合作协
议。协议约定，在本协议有效期内（自本协议生效之日起至 2030 年 12 月 31 日止），瑞浦兰钧
（含瑞浦兰钧温州基地及下属各关联公司基地）向九江天赐采购总量不少于80 万吨的电解液产品，
且九江天赐能满足瑞浦兰钧月度最高需求时不低于 2 万吨供应量。电解液产品之核心原材料六氟磷酸
锂的价格由双方另行协商确定。本协议如果充分履行，将对公司 2026 年至 2030 年度经营业绩产生
固态电池材料预计2026 年完成中试产线建设。公司在固态电池材料布局主要包括硫化物及氧化物固
态电解质路线，目前硫化物路线的固态电解质处于中试阶段，主要配合下游电池客户做材料技术验证，
同时中试产线建设也在持续的推动，公司计划在2026 年完成中试产线建设，并具备中试量产的能力。
逐步提升回收碳酸锂的使用比例。公司目前自供的碳酸锂原材料主要来源于锂矿资源加工和废旧电池
回收业务。在锂矿资源布局方面，公司会综合考虑成本及相关风险因素，采取谨慎投资的策略。在回
收业务上，公司将持续完善和开拓废旧电池的来源渠道，确保回收材料供应充足，并逐步提升回收碳
酸锂的使用比例，以满足客户及欧洲电池法案等相关法规对回收材料使用比例的要求。
电解液及六氟磷酸锂的价格预计将趋于良性恢复。公司预计未来电解液及六氟磷酸锂的产品价格将逐
步趋向于良性的恢复，一方面是受核心原材料碳酸锂的价格波动影响，另一方面是随着下游需求的持
续提升，行业的产能利用率水平也稳步提高，在供需格局好转的背景下，产品价格及盈利水平也会稳
步回升到合理水平。公司认为，目前六氟磷酸锂三家头部供应商的开工率已经处于相对较高水平，其
他不具备成本优势的产能，实际的生产负荷低或没有实际开车，综合来看，目前六氟磷酸锂的市场供
需处于相对平衡阶段。公司在现有生产的产线上存在技改提升产能的空间，但目前暂未考虑投放生产，
公司会维持相对平衡的产能利用率水平，新增产能的投放节奏会结合市场的需求变化情况综合考虑。
盈利预测。我们给予公司2025-2027 年归母净利润分别为114016252251 亿元。参考可比公司，
考虑到公司固态电池材料建设和新增产能，给予公司一定估值溢价，给予公司2026 年45 倍PE，首
次覆盖给予公司目标价3825 元，给予收集评级。

Whats New
Signed a cooperation agreement with REPT Battero Energy On September 22 2025 the wholly-owned
agreement stipulates that during the validity period of this agreement (from the effective date of this agreement
to December 31 2030) REPT Battero Energy (including REPT Battero Energy Wenzhou base and its affiliated
Tianci and Jiujiang Tianci shall be able to meet REPT Battero Energys monthly maximum demand with a
supply of no less than 20000 tons The price of lithium hexafluorophosphate the core raw material of
electrolyte products shall be determined through separate negotiation between the two parties If this
The construction of the pilot production line for solid-state battery materials is expected to be
solid-state electrolyte routes Currently the sulfide routes solid-state electrolyte is in the pilot stage mainly
cooperating with downstream battery customers for material technology verification At the same time the
construction of the pilot production line by 2026 and has the ability to mass produce it
consider costs and related risk factors and adopt a cautious investment strategy In terms of recycling
supply of recycled materials and gradually increase the proportion of recycled lithium carbonate to meet the
requirements of customers and relevant regulations such as the European Battery Act on the proportion of
recycled materials
Whats Different
The prices of electrolytes and lithium hexafluorophosphate tend towards a benign recovery The
towards a benign recovery in the future On the one hand this is due to the price fluctuations of the core raw
material lithium carbonate On the other hand with the continuous improvement of downstream demand the
industrys capacity utilization level will steadily increase Against the backdrop of an improved supply-demand
believes that the operating rates of the three top suppliers of lithium hexafluorophosphate are currently at a
relatively high level Other production capacities that do not have cost advantages have low actual production
loads or no actual start-up Overall the market supply and demand of lithium hexafluorophosphate are in a
a relatively balanced level of capacity utilization and the pace of launching new capacity will be
coverage and Acccumulate rating will be given
Risks of technological iteration fluctuations in raw material prices overseas expansion and intellectual property
