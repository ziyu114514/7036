一体化项目丰富产品结构。一体化项目以电石为原料，通过炔醛法生产 14 丁二醇（BDO）；以
BDO 为原料，生产 N-甲基吡咯烷酮（NMP）产品和聚己二酸对苯二甲酸丁二醇酯（ PBAT）产
品。项目设计产能为年产 20 万吨BDO、16 万吨NMP 及3 万吨 PBAT 生物可降解材料。公司一体化
项目部分装置已打通流程，生产出合格产品，进入试生产阶段。根据可行性研究报告测算，一体化项
目预计总投资 3387 亿元。一体化项目投产的部分装置包括BDO、NMP 相关装置，可新增20 万吨
年BDO、5 万吨年NMP 产品生产能力。
投资建设气化平台升级改造项目。项目立足原煤消耗量不变进行气化装置替代，装置以煤为原料，经
煤气化、净化后生产合成气；主要装置包括气化装置、辅助生产装置和部分配套公用工程。项目建成
投产后，主要产品生产规模为合成气总量 4509 万 Nm 3h（以有效气COH2 计Nm3h）；项目建设
周期 18 个月。 本项目预计总投资为 3039 亿元，项目建设资金由公司自有资金和银行贷款解决。根
据可行性研究报告测算，本项目建成投产后预计年均实现营业收入3665 亿元（按产出物全部对外销
售测算），但本项目所产合成气为公司最终产品的原料气，故经济效益由最终产品盈利能力决定。
盈利预测。我们给予公司2025-2027 年归母净利润分别为370045895184 亿元。参考可比公司，
考虑到公司为一体化项目和升级改造项目给予一定估值溢价，给予公司2026 年145 倍PE，首次覆
盖给予公司目标价3132 元，给予买入评级。
