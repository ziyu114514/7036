事件：2025 年11 月28 日，中国中免举办投资者交流日。
政策红利释放，公司业绩有望触底回升。离岛免税新政实施首周，海南旅游消费市场持续升温，离岛免税购物金额
达506 亿元，购物人数达729 万人次，同比分别增长3486%和337%，需求韧性得以验证。10-11 月海南离岛免税
销售数据均实现双位数增长，公司对于明年的整体预期持有信心。凭借离岛离境双免税的稀缺牌照，在政策红利
持续释放的背景下，公司有望迎来新一轮的增长。
公司计划对海棠湾项目、市内免税店及机场免税店实施全方位渠道升级，提升销售表现。海棠湾项目将通过三期差
异化布局实现功能互补。一期聚焦一站式免税购物，以盒子形式提供全系列商品；二期侧重有税业态；三期则打
造由北欧设计师事务所设计的生活街区，注重生活方式与亲子体验，并计划与LV 等品牌合作推出三亚专属产品。市
内免税店将充分利用先征后退的消费税退税政策，引入国内商品，并针对入境外国客群重点拓展无人机、手机及
中国黑科技电子产品等品类；同时，其定位将强化为中免会员的服务桥梁，通过提供线下退换货、维修等服务，引
导线下客流至线上平台。机场免税店方面，尽管北京、上海机场国际客流量已恢复，但销售表现仍有提升空间，公
司将重点对上海机场卫星厅进行全方位改造，以将其打造为关键的销售增长渠道。
精品稳步提升，3C 产品权重提升，新兴品类或将贡献销售增量。黄金产品已成为公司新支柱之一，公司通过引入老
庙、中国黄金、六福、谢瑞麟等多品牌形成规模效应，并计划持续引进更多品牌以强化该品类优势。3C 电子产品权
重显著提升，公司从无到有建立起苹果、华为等品牌的免税销售渠道，2025 年苹果产品销售额目标接近25 亿元，且
品牌方为其开设旅游零售专属渠道并提供售后支持。健康产品及营养滋补品未来潜力突出，公司正在积极申请特医
食品、保健品及OTC 资质，计划将其打造为新的业务增长支撑。此外，宠物、乐器等新品类，以及丝巾、服饰、鞋
帽、咖啡、陶瓷、茶叶等被允许进入离岛免税的商品，也将共同贡献销售增量。
以持续增长的会员体系为基础，实施差异化的销售策略。截至25Q3，公司会员规模已达4600 万，月均新增超100
万且即将突破5000 万，会员活跃度与复购率表现突出，线上复购率超35%。针对高净值客群，公司推出S 店计划，
通过引入岛外高级店长、对标品牌旗舰店标准全面提升管理、体验与CRM 体系，已有25 家奢侈品店铺经品牌神秘
访客评分超过品牌自营店。同时开展私域营销，通过企业微信沉淀500 万高端客户并实施一对一需求沟通，2025 年
的客单价较2024 年提升4-5 倍。此外，公司还定期举办珠宝鉴定、高端订货会等专属品鉴活动，深度满足高净值客
群的特定需求。在新兴客群拓展上，针对离境外国客群，俄罗斯客人消费表现突出，已占离境客群约40%，东南亚
及日韩客群在港澳机场店成交率较高，公司正计划与日韩运营商探索会员合作。面向岛内居民，则计划通过亲子活
动、周年庆等形式增强本地客群的参与感与获得感，但岛民免税尚未对公司业绩提升有较大帮助，需要等具体政策
严控资本开支，高效管理现金。资本开支方面，公司对重资产平台类项目（如三亚三期、海口项目）控制投资总
量，平衡投入与收益。公司为现金流型企业，现金流充裕，不会长期持有大量现金流（理财收益低于免税运营回
报），持续研究投资并购机会。公司未来将沿海外经营拓展、一带一路项目研究等方向布局，通过投资并购获取快
风险提示：宏观经济增长低于预期，免税政策变动，市场竞争加剧等。
