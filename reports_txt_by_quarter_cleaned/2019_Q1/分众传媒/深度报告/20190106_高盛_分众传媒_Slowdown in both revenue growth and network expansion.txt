Focus Media We think the cyclical impact on advertisement might
be more serious than expected and revenue growth might further
slow down to the low teens level after 4Q18 in line with that
observed during 2013-15 Meanwhile the slowing down of Focus
Medias network expansion as well as the new round of nancing
that its rival Xinchao Media has secured from Baidu and others
might lead to a longer-than-expected price war Hence we cut our
2018E-21E EPS by 16%-20% to reect lower revenue as well as
lower margins We expect 2019E NI to decline by 8% yoy to
Rmb558bn due to lower ASP and higher cost per screen According
to our estimates 4Q18 and 1Q19 should be the growth rate trough
We cut our 12-month target price to Rmb789 (was Rmb1167) but
maintain Buy on attractive valuation (the stock is trading at 14x
2019E PE vs an average of 20x for global outdoor advertising
peers and 18x average for domestic media peers)
Macro headwinds intensify
Macro headwinds have begun to impact advertising expenditure
According to CTR China advertisement expenditure on traditional
media (ex-internet media) was down 28% in October declining
further from a 15% yoy fall in 3Q18 after a 93% yoy rise in 1H18
Thanks to the Singles Day advertising campaign of Alibaba and other
Poster ads maintained relatively stable growth increasing
239%236% yoy in Oct respectively vs 26%25% in Sept
However we think the impact from macro headwinds might further
expand to inner building advertisement expenditure and notably
brand advertising at the low end is the ad basket most likely to be
cut in our view due to the limited targeting ability of inner building

ad formats During the investor meeting at the GS China Conference held on Nov 16
management also expressed concerns about the impact from the economic slowdown
and expected revenue growth in 4Q18 to further slow down to the mid-teen level
Currently the biggest contribution of advertisement revenue is from FMCG products
which grew 57% yoy in 1H18 and contributed 24% of total ad revenue for Focus Media
Excluding FMCG other sectors grew at 16% yoy in 1H18 Given that FMCG usually has
6-9 months time lag in the advertisement cycle vs macroeconomic growth we think
2019 growth might see a drag from a deceleration in FMCG advertising Furthermore
internet advertising might continue its single-digit growth in inner building media given
enters a matured stage of penetration

Competition remains a concern but screen roll out might slow down
position in the industry securing another round of nancing of Rmb21bn (led by Baidu)
alarm is still not disarmed from Focus Medias perspective According to the CEO of
will realize revenue of Rmb1bn in 2018 (which is far less than its April 2018 announced
target of Rmb15bn) but is still running at a loss and would like to monetize the
operation of the current network We see this as a signal of alleviation of the elevator
resources war Meanwhile Focus Media also sent out similar signals During the
investor meeting at the November GS China Conference Focus Media management
indicated that terminal expansion in 2019 might slow down and trend at the low end of
might focus more on the monetization of new screens We think the trimming of the
screen roll-out plan for 2019 is due to several factors 1) the macro headwinds bring less
expansion and 3) Focus Media will have developed 11-12mn new screens as of end
secured most incremental prime locations in 2018 There is no need to further expand
aggressively in 2019 in our view
(11mn coverage of elevators according to our estimate) and Xinchao Media (700k
Including the other smaller players in lower tier cities the penetration of elevators with
advertising media would be even higher than 50% Therefore we think the network
expansion of Focus Media and Xinchao Media would be more determined by the growth
rate of elevators in China which we estimate at 10%-12% in the next couple of years
number of ad terminals in elevators to reach 295mn342mn in 201920 (down from
371mn492mn for 201920 previously) implying 14% and 16% growth in line with the
average growth rate between 2014-17 Still we expect the ASP (average revenue per
terminal) growth to continue to decline by 2%-3% during 2019-20 as demand growth
While this supply slowdown could ease the cost pressures we think the intense price
with less likelihood that Xinchao is squeezed out of the market given that Baidu the
decided to slow its network expansion With its much smaller size (Xinchaos 2018
revenue will likely be only about 6%-7% of Focus Medias) we think Xinchao Media will
continue to lose money for a while until it proactively stops its price war and focuses
more on protability and monetization Chances of a co-existing dual oligarchic market

structure in the long run are increasing in our view and if that happens we expect
Focus Medias protability to stabilize in the next 2-3 years
Estimate and valuation
We cut our 2018E-2021E revenue for Focus Media by 13%-137% mainly to reect
lower advertising spend on the back of macroeconomic uncertainties We now expect
21%10%13%15% revenue growth in 2018E-21E For the inner building media
business (the largest business contributing 80% of total revenue) we expect revenue
growth to slow down to the mid-teen level in 4Q18 and then signicantly slow further to
10% yoy in 2019 similar to what happened during 2013-14 when China GDP growth also
faced strong headwinds After 2019 we expect growth to recover moderately to 14%
and 15% on the back of the economy stabilizing and monetization of the new screen
format—the vertical screen customized for LBS (Location-based) local advertisers
We think COGS will continue to grow rapidly (at 35% yoy in 2019 and 20% in 2020)
increased supply
We also cut 2018E-21E EPS by 16%-20% to reect lower revenue as well as lower
margins We think COGS will continue to outgrow revenue in the next two years due to
increasing rental cost per screen lower ad upload and lower ASP We expect overall GP
margin to continue to go down from 65% in 2018E to 58% in 2019 until it stabilizes at
55% in 2020 We expect EBIT margin to decline from 42% in 2018E to 34% in 2020E
We expect NI to decline by 8% yoy in 2019E to Rmb558bn due to lower ASP and higher
cost per screen

Due to high base in 2H17 and 1H18 we think NI growth will turn negative in 4Q18
(-41% yoy) and 1H19 (-22% yoy) before stabilizing in 2H19  We expect 4Q18 and 1Q19
will be the trough of the NI growth rate

Following the cut to our estimates we lower our 12-m TP  to Rmb789 (was Rmb1167)
Our TP methodology is still based on PE but we roll back the target year from 2021 to
2020 to better reect near-term growth momentum and we now apply a multiple of
20x (was 23x) as we benchmark to global peers current 12m forward PE levels We
continue to discount back to 2019 using 8% COE We maintain a Buy rating on
valuation
Economic slowdown could impact overall ad expenditure Focus Medias ad revenue is
highly correlated with advertising market growth which is largely driven by economic
growth If economic growth further slows advertisers tend to cut their ad budgets thus
hurting Focus Medias revenue growth
Competition gets tougher If Xinchao Media adopts a more aggressive expansion
strategy and launch another round of price war on advertisement and elevator rental
Focus Media might have to ght back ercely by reaccelerating network expansion or
via a price war which would further weigh on margins
be unlocked including 23% from the founder of Focus Media and 30% from a group of
backdoor listing If these potential unlocked shares were sold off it might pose material
pressure on the share price

Returns and Multiple) Growth Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for specic metrics for each stock The
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute The precise calculation of each metric may
vary depending on the scal year industry and region but the standard approach is as follows
Growth is based on a stocks forward-looking sales growth EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for nancial stocks only EPS and sales growth) with a
pricedividend (PD) EVEBITDA EVFCF and EVDebt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for nancial stocks only PE PB and PD) with a higher percentile
