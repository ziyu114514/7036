了業績，同時確認了92 億的一次性溢價投資收益，而第三季度幷無此因素。另外，
第三季度的業績增速放緩也受到下游景氣度下行的拖累，公司主要客戶上汽系合資車
企上汽大衆和上汽通用三季度銷量同比增速均由正轉負，上汽自主的體量較小，同比
增速也由上半年的50%收窄到18%。
2018 年前三個季度的毛利率呈現逐季改善態勢，分別爲131%、141%、143%，分別
同比上升-161、037、061 個百分點。毛利率的改善主要來自于合幷華域視覺中毛利
公司二、三季度管理費用增加較明顯，管理費用率分別爲818%、926%，同比上升
016、15 個百分點，預計主要來自于合幷華域視覺的整合費用。公司第三季經營性現

售後市場競爭優勢的同時，根據汽車零部件行業未來技術發展趨勢，積極開展無級變
