2018年年底，贵州茅台在其年度经销商大会上宣布对销售渠道进行重
大调整，引起投资者的广泛关注。我们将在本文中分析贵州茅台将如
何向直销渠道加大投放、渠道改革可能对销售均价盈利产生何样影
响，并解答其他一些问题。
为何现在改革？ 为减少寻租机会和潜在腐败空间，贵州茅台冻结了经
销商数量和经销商配额。此外，2016年推出的新零售线上经销模
式的进展不及预期，主要归因于未能消除线上线下套利机会（尽管
这种模式可帮助公司更深入地了解客户）。公司转而将致力于加大直
销渠道投放，增开新店、并提高商超和线上零售等第三方的销售力
度。需要说明的是，经销商渠道仍将占主导地位、但占比将大幅下
降，在2019年茅台酒总销量中的占比预计将从2018年的80%降至
56%，直销渠道的重要地位将上升。
重获利润：我们认为上述调整将加速推进渠道改革，其目的不仅是提
升定价能力，还旨在通过加大直销投放、在价值链上重获利润份额。
总体而言，我们积极看待贵州茅台的渠道改革，并将2019-2021年收
入预测上调12%-38%，将2019-2021年每股盈利预测上调
35%-66%，以主要反映销售渠道结构调整带动的销售均价上升。我
们还推出了2022年预测，并将12个月目标价格从人民币708元上调至
842元，仍基于22倍市盈率（但延展至2022年）并以10%的行业股权
成本贴现回2019年计算得出。鉴于贵州茅台的市场领先地位和明确的
增长潜力，我们维持对该股的买入评级（位于强力买入名单）。

Reforms will boost direct sales allowing capture of more margin
As we highlighted in our report earlier this month (2018 results and 2019 guidance in
line structural reform debut) Moutai announced its reform plan for sales and marketing
on Dec 28 which we consider the start of structural reforms
Key focus of the reform was to address internal corruption
In May 2018 Moutai announced a change of its chairman followed by other key
management changes at the parent group to listco and all the way down to subsidiaries
the reason behind the extensive management changes was to address corruption within
distribution license and existing distributors want to grab more supply and merchants
lobby for written-notes that allow them to purchase lower priced product So the
gap between ex-factory price and retail price has allowed opportunities for rent-seeking
behavior among certain Moutai employees on the back of the wide arbitrage
opportunities
The local government in Guizhou where Moutai is headquartered published a
legislation on Jan 17th forbidding government officers and their relatives (including
spouse children and childrens spouses) to carry out business with Moutai directly
Per the legislation the officers or their families are also not allowed to influence the
believe this action taken by the Guizhou government illustrates that Moutais reform is
owns 100% of the parent group of Moutai)
No new distributors supply to shift to direct channels
number of distributor numbers and distribution quotas According to management there
increase the number of distributors or franchised stores going forward As a result of this
policy we expect to see considerable restructuring of the sales channels with more
volume shifting from distributors to the direct sales channel
spirits in 2019 with 17000 tons to distributors based on equivalent quotas of 2017
has said it will increase direct sales
Distributor channel will still dominate but direct sales to rise in importance
In our view the distributor channel will remain the dominant sales channel for Moutai
sales volume through distributor channel accounted for over 80% of total Moutai spirits
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
sales volume We expect this to shrink to 56% in 2019E and decline further to c50% in
Exports and supply to the parent group has generally increased with total volume
supply with volume share to these markets up from c6% five years ago to c11% in
2017 Going forward we expect the percentage of export volume and supply to parent
group in total volume of Moutai spirits to remain largely stable at 12%-15%
On the other hand we estimate sales volume through the direct sales channel to more
than triple in 2019 vs 2018 to account for c30% total sales volume of Moutai spirits We
also expect the structure of direct sales channels to change Within direct sales
channels self-owned stores and large supermarkets are most controllable and its
relatively easy for Moutai to build new stores or pass on products to supermarkets in
our view As a consequence we expect sales volume through these two channels to
direct sales to increase form 21% in 2018 to 60% in 2019) Sales of customized
products are mainly driven by demand from corporates and we expect growth to largely
remain stable For sales through written-notes we expect it to decrease significantly as

Challenges to the execution of reform plans
more than 20% of total supply of Moutai spirits from distributors to direct sales channel
will not be easy given the following considerations
Pricing and distribution in direct sales channels
According to the management 17000 tons out of 31000 tons of Moutai spirits will be
signed to distributors in 2019 Although actual shipments to distributors and total supply
may be higher than guided numbers we believe sales through distributors in 2019 will
be significantly lower vs our estimated c25000 tons in 2018 implying sales through
direct channels will have to make up the difference
We believe the most feasible and straightforward way for Moutai is to push product sales
stores or just increase the supply to each store Opening new stores would take time
CAPEX of Rmb850mn) while increasing supply to existing stores can also lead to
inventory pile up and therefore lead to price pressure in our view
Supermarkets - price balance needed to incentivize sales
For direct sales through supermarkets there is still uncertainty on how it may proceed It
could potentially look to build joint-ventures with large supermarket groups or just sign
contract to deliver products where we believe pricing could be an issue Theoretically
the ex-factory price to supermarkets should be higher than the price to distributors and
lower than retail price If the price is set high supermarkets will not have strong incentive
margin will narrow
E-Commerce - potential for conflict with parent Cloud platform did not perform as
customers through Moutai Cloud Store
estimates
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
Moutai to reconcile this conflict
rising pressure on Moutai spirits retail price and tap a larger chunk of the profit pool by
market retail price) arbitrage opportunities arose Scalpers tried to take advantage of
this arbitrage opportunity by buying as much Moutai spirits as they could through Moutai
Platform and only allowed limited purchase per capita However its efforts did not have
the desired results as speculators managed to circumvent the system
Taking 2018 CNY as an example the market price for 53% vol Feitian Moutai was Rmb
1800bottle in retail stores while the guided price offered by Cloud Platform was Rmb
1499bottle Some speculators used software to automatically place orders on Moutai
This squeezed out actual consumers who were not able to buy even one bottle even
after sometimes waiting for hours Even after Moutai added advanced technologies like
ID identificationface identification to its Cloud Platform to prevent speculation in Sep
2018 scalpers still devised ways to find arbitrage opportunities (such as hiring people
often students or senior citizens to buy the products instead) As a consequence the
through this channel is relative constrained nowadays (30-40% of distributors
allocated volume in 2017 vs c10% in 2018 according to our estimates) In many ways
the reforms announced in December 2018 supersede the 2017 online plan
Written notes and Customized - not moving the dial
For the remaining direct sales channels including written-note and customized products
on stamping out corruption is the main reason for the current sales channel reform and
management has noted its intention to get rid of the written-note channel This channel
represents c33% of direct sales volume in 2018 according to our estimates but we
expect this to fall to c8% in 2019
Second the ex-factory price of customized product is still low (Rmb 1299bottle for 53%
for 53% Vol Feitian Moutai) Since customized products cannot be readily resold there
is no arbitrage opportunity but still we believe Moutai will need to think of pricing and
keep a balance between price and volume for customized product
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
Price gap is the key to success in direct sales channels
In our view price gap is the overriding factor that affects the direct sales volume In
2012 Moutai had an aggressive plan to open 100 self-owned stores but this did not
materialize The price gap between retail price and ex-factory price of Feitian Moutai
peaked at the end of 2011 and Moutai wanted to take this profit by opening self-owned
However the price gap narrowed swiftly in 2012 due to the fall in retail prices post the
implementation of the governments anti-corruption campaign As a result operating
self-owned stores became less profitable and Moutai discarded the plan for rapid
increase of its direct stores Historically we have seen that opening self-owned stores
has been a good strategy for Moutai where it could offer appealing retail price on
products sold through its self owned stores - especially when retail prices at third party
distributors are high Nevertheless during low consumption cycles when distributor
margins are already thin self owned stores may not be able to offer a better price given
the market price is already close to ex-factory price in which case sales volume through
self-owned stores may decrease sharply
Can direct sales fully substitute for distributors No but we expect the share to
normalise at 50%
of the distributor channel we do not believe that the distributor channel can be
networks and relationships with buyers which we think makes it very unlikely that
going forward we expect the distributor channel to still contribute 50% of total sales
volume for Moutai
Will a change in sales channel structure likely solve corruption issues
In our view the key reason for the change in the sales channel structure is that direct
sales is less likely to give rise to rent-seeking opportunities and corruption within Moutai
inspections were carried out The new management team acknowledged in its letter
to distributors that illegal operations rent-seeking problems connected transactions
working to eradicate these issues Based on recent steps by the management including
progress on this front However it remains to be seen how much these reforms will meet
on these reforms which we expect to be most visible in higher ASPs (see below)
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
Whats the current sales channel at the ex-factory level
Currently at the ex-factory level Moutai has four sales channels (1) Domestic
Distributor channel (2) Export channel (3) Supply to parent group and (4) Direct sales
1) Domestic Distributor channel There are a total of 1829 domestic distributors for
1285 Franchised Stores In the past five years distributor channel has been the
dominant sales channel taking 80% of annual its supply For the brands flagship
Franchised Stores at the ex-factory price of Rmb969bottle and according to our
channel check the current wholesale price at which these distributors sell to lower-tier
distributors or retail channels is over Rmb1700bottle implying c43% gross
margin(much higher than historical average of 25%) We note that these distributors
could also choose to sell directly to consumersgroup buyers at a retail price of over
Rmb1800bottle in which case the actual gross margin for distributors could be even
higher than 43%

2) Export channel There are currently 62 overseas distributors for Moutai spirits In
2017 export revenue including sales of Moutai spirits and series products accounted for
4% of total sales In 2018 we estimate the export volume of Moutai spirits at c2150
tons c7% of total Moutai spirits sales volume
3) Connected-transaction sales to parent group In 2018 the listco is expected to record
a sale of Rmb38bn (incl-VAT) to its parent group at the same ex-factory price as it sells
to domestic distributors (eg Feitian Moutai at the ex-factory price of Rmb969)
Moutai spirits to the parent group would be c1500 tons in 2018 accounting for 5% of
total sales volume
Currently the parent group together with its other subsidiaries holds 73% of Moutai
directly through its Moutai Cloud-Platform to its end customers According to Moutais
connected transaction disclosures we estimate the sales volume of Moutai spirits from
Guiyang Beijing and Shanghai which could engage in wholesaling and group selling
tons in 2018
quarterly basis in the last couple of years For 9M18 revenue from direct sales was

volume of direct sales of Moutai spirits at Rmb705bn (11% of total operating
revenue)2447 tons (79% of total volume)
—Self-owned stores Currently there are 36 self-owned stores which were built during
store in each province with more than one store in big cities like Beijing and Shanghai
Each store has c10 tons of volume quota on average per year with differentiation
between big stores and small stores Self-owned stores sell directly to end customers at
the officially guided price(eg for Feitian Moutai at Rmb1499bottle)
—Customized products sold to group accounts In 2014 Moutai founded the
Customized Marketing Company (with 70% stake) which specializes in providing
customized products for celebrities or corporates After five years of operation we
expect this subsidiary to sell c1000 tons customized products and generate Rmb21bn
in 2018 accounting for only 3% of total revenue still far from the initial target of 10% (of
total volume) set in 2014 and much lower than the Rmb5bn revenue target set for 2017
lower-than-retail price (Rmb 1499bottle for Feitian Moutai) through a written note once
approved by management or senior executives We estimate sales volume through this
channel to be c 800 tons in 2018 accounting for 33%26% of direct sales volumetotal
emphasis on addressing misuse of this channel
—Large supermarkets In 2014 Moutai Yonghui Superstores and Shenzhen
Moutai spirits to large supermarkets including Yonghui Superstores Carrefour Walmart
etc This sales channel is still lagging behind others accounting for c5% of direct sales
based on its guidance on a supply shift from distributors to direct sales
groups sales through this channel As we mentioned before Moutai supplied c1500
c 1000 tons according to our estimates However we estimate sale of c 120 tons by
贵州茅台 (600519SS)
A boost to both revenues and margins
We estimate that the sales channel change will have an impact on blended ASP for
Moutai spirits and thus affect revenue margins and earnings Moutais blended ASP
product mix change (3) sales channel change
Moutai implemented a price hike on Jan 1 2018 and management noted in Jan 2019
that they would not implement any price hikes this year However due to the pre-sale
procedure part of the products sold in 1Q18 were sold at the old price before the price
hike took effect As a result we estimate 1% ASP increase in 2019 For product mix
upgrade management hoped to direct incremental sales volume to premium products
so we think Moutai may provide more Jingpin Moutai Vintage Moutai and Zodiac
Moutai and accordingly drive 5% ASP increase in 2019
Incorporating the change in sales channel mix we estimate a 7% increase in ASP
considering higher ex-factory price through direct sales channel Overall we estimate
13% ASP increase for Moutai spirits in 2019

For Feitian Moutai the mainstream Moutai spirit gross profit margin was c92% in 2018
for non-direct sales channels including distributor channels supply to parent group and
exports per our estimates For direct sales channels the overall gross margin is higher
than non-direct sales but also depends on distributions among various types of direct
sales channel The most profitable channels have been self-owned stores and
written-note which have managed to achieve c95% gross profit margin historically We
estimate the gross margin of Moutai spirits to increase 05ppt from 938% in 2018 to
659%46% in 2019E
We also conducted scenario analysis for this sales channel change and analyzed
blended ASP of Moutai spirits by direct sales on revenue and net profit In our base
case we have Rmb 1366bottle for Moutai spirits blended ASP through direct sales in
2019 which is based on our sales channel breakdown In the bear casebull case we
assume -10%10% change on direct sales ASP As a result our revenue changes by
-30%26% and net profit by -34%30% respectively accordingly to our estimates
What could be the other impacts beyond earnings
As discussed in our previous report (2018 results and 2019 guidance in line structural
reform debut) we think there are additional benefits besides earnings improvement if the

control over retail price to end consumers given it sells vast majority of products to
distributors So if it can shift more volume to direct sales especially to self-owned stores
it will be able to interfere in market price through adjusting retail price in self-owned
stores and as a consequence price volatility and market risk will be reduced Second
potential corruption behavior and enhance channel management
Estimates and valuation
We revise up our 2019E-2021E revenue estimates by 12%-38% and 2019E-2021E
EPS by 35%-66% mainly to reflect greater ASP increase of Moutai spirits due to sales
channel changes We introduce 2022E estimates and raise our 12-month target price to
Rmb 842(from Rmb 708) still based on 22x PE but rolled over to 2022E and discounted
back to 2019E (using 10% sector COE) Previously we used 22x 2021E PE discounted
