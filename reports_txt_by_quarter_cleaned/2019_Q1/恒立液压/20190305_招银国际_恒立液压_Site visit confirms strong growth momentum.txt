Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH)
Site visit confirms strong growth momentum
 Key highlights We visited Jiangsu Henglis headquarters and production base
in Changzhou last week Key positives (1) Outstanding product quality enables
Hengli to continue to gain market share from the Japanese players (2) Hengli is
well-prepared to boost the sales of hydraulic pumps and valves an area that is
currently dominated by the foreign players which will serve as a key growth
rate (24 hours per day) due to very strong backlog (monthly production plan
45k units) Hengli preannounced in Jan that its 2018E net profit is expected to
grow 114-130% YoY to RMB820-880mn We see potential 20% total revenue
growth in 2019E with potential margin expansion driven by pumps  valves
 Company background Jiangsu Hengli was founded in 2005 headquartered in
Changzhou Jiangsu Hengli has expanded its product line to hydraulic
Hengli currently has 40% market share in hydraulic cylinder for excavator
(Henglis key products) in China WANGs family is the controlling shareholder
with 71% interest in Hengli The Company has been listed in SSE since 2011
Hengli spent more than a decade to establish its track record and has successfully
manufactures such as SANY Heavy (600031 CH NR) Caterpillar (CAT US NR)
and XCMG (000425 CH NR) For instance Hengli has already supplied 50% of
CATs hydraulic cylinders During the site visit we noted that Hengli has well-
designed production lines equipped with highly automatic robots and machines
 Market share gains to continue Normally an excavator is equipped with four
units of hydraulic cylinder and one set of pump  valve Given that excavator
sales in China was 203k units in 2018 this translated into 812k units of
hydraulic cylinder demand Currently Hengli has 40% of market share in
hydraulic cylinder and there exists further room to gain market share from
peers such as KYB (7242 JP NR) Henglis hydraulic cylinder products are
 Hydraulic pump  valve the next growth driver Hengli is on track to ramp up
its capacity on pumps and valves Given that the ASP of pump  valve is several
times higher than hydraulic cylinder we see room for Hengli to boost its pump
 valve revenue to a level similar to that of hydraulic cylinder in a few years time
order to gain market share Several existing customers have started the
procurement of pump  valve from Hengli
