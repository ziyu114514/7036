Challenging 2019 Downgrade to Hold
 Mideas shares have re-rated on foreign buying news flow on a possible consumption
stimulus and Mideas share buyback announcement We think the rally presents an
opportunity to take profit and we downgrade to Hold
 Lackluster January sales data supports our cautious 2019 outlook
 High inventory levels in the AC category remain a concern for 2019
 A stimulus could lift appliance demand by RMB700bn but details remain scarce
 We value Midea at 13x 2020 PER and upgrade our target price from RMB42 to
RMB46 under our base case scenario
Foreign buying and policy expectations drive share price
Following our target price cut after Mideas 3Q18 results consensus EPS numbers have
continued to drift down Mideas share price however has rebounded and is up 31%
YTD We believe the rally is grounded in EM inflows expectations of a consumption
stimulus and Mideas recent announcement of a share buyback We think the underlying
fundamentals are largely unchanged from 3Q18 A cap imposed on foreign buying and
the recent price rally provide an opportunity for profit taking
Limited pick-up in home appliance sales in January
Following Mideas weak 3Q18 CMM data show a limited turnaround in appliance sales in
4Q18 and JanFeb We expect lackluster 1Q19 results particularly in ACs due to the high
base effect and channel inventory overhang We are more upbeat about potential
Concern about AC channel inventory
total channel inventory for the sector may be approaching levels last seen in 2014 prior to
the previous market downturn in ACs Considering high channel AC inventory Mideas
flat ASP growth in 3Q18 and a high base effect in 1H19 we think 2019 prospects look
Stimulus could lift appliance demand by RMB700bn in 201921
Comments by Ning Jizhe vice chairman of NDRC suggest that a new policy may be
unrolled to boost appliance consumption in China News reports suggest the NDRC may
be estimating a RMB700bn impact on appliance demand in 20192021 We construct a
scenario where consumption stimulus benefits Mideas top line by RMB20bn annually
beginning in 2H19
Target price updated to RMB46 downgrade to Hold
We roll our estimates forward to 2020 adjusting Mideas share base to account for the
RMB46 on account of these changes Our valuation methodology remains unchanged at
13x prospective PER In the near term a cap on foreign investment may lead to a
temporary halt in Mideas re-rating In a scenario where new consumption policy rolls out
nationally increasing appliance sales by RMB700bn in 20192021 we think Midea is
potentially worth RMB50 per share or 5% more than current price level Our stimulus
scenario valuation is based on 13x 2020 PER We continue to like Midea because of its
long-term product upgrade story and exposure to international markets but feel that the
recent market rally has run ahead of slowing fundamentals

For our base case scenario and current target price we omit revenue growth
driven by a stimulus In our base case scenario we value Midea at RMB46 per
share or a 33% discount from Mideas current share price The increase in our
target price from RMB42 to RMB46 is driven by rolling our EPS estimate forward
to 2020 and adjusting Mideas share base for anticipated buybacks and the Little
Swan acquisition Our base case target price is based on a 13x 2020 PER We
believe that a ceiling on foreign ownership may prevent a positive re-rating from
continuing and prefer to benchmark Mideas PE in line with the recent market
valuation Our forecast EPS is -5% and -10% below 20192020 consensus
respectively
We think the recent re-rating on Mideas valuation and cap on foreign ownership
presents an opportunity to take profit on Midea We continue to like Midea for its
long-term product upgrade potential KUKAs expansion in China and export
potential but we think that Mideas current re-rating is detached from business
fundamentals Therefore we downgrade Midea to HOLD Risks to our
downgrade include a hot summer improving sentiment on Chinas real estate
market and an earlier-than-expected announcement on a consumer stimulus

Share price rally detached from fundamentals
According to the WSJ investors have shifted US86bn into emerging market
equities and bonds year to date This figure is greater than the last 9 months of
Markets Index which is up 13% from 2018s lows
Since the beginning of 2019 monthly net inflows via the Stock Connect have
averaged RMB60bn per month Midea has been a significant beneficiary of this
inflow with northbound investor ownership increasing from 135% to 16% since
the beginning of 2019 The 16% ownership disclosed by HKEX excludes foreign
investors with QFII allocation so foreign investment in Midea is in reality higher
Foreign inflows Mideas recent share buyback announcement and expectations
of a consumption stimulus in 2019 have driven a recent re-rating of Midea which
currently trades at 14x consensus 2019 PER However as at March 7 2019
foreign holding in Midea is approaching the 28% ceiling This means that foreign
investment will no longer continue to drive demand for Mideas shares at least
in the near term Furthermore some index providers may be required to reduce
Mideas weighting in major indices The change may not be permanent but
could lead to a temporary halt in Mideas recent re-rating We view this as an
opportunity to take profit

Appliances sales growth in JanFeb 2019 remained
Mideas share price is up 31% YTD but current business fundamentals
continue to show limited growth After posting 28% AC growth and 7%
consumer appliance growth in 1H18 Mideas aggregate top line grew only 14%
in 3Q18 KUKAs top line expanded 66% in 3Q18 indicating the slowdown was
appliance related
According to CMM retail sales growth for appliances remained slow in 4Q18
and in early 2019 (February data currently available only for online sales) This
data leads us to believe that its 1Q19 results are unlikely to post a turnaround
CMM data is based on online data from major Chinese platforms as well as a
representative set of 10000 stores across China

Mideas AC inventory well-controlled but channel
AC channel inventory approaching a historical high
Midea estimates its own total inventory is well-controlled at 56m units in line
with its 3Q18 figure However news sources indicate that total channel inventory
levels (including all AC brands) is reaching historical highs China IOL for
instance suggests that inventory levels are 50m units across all brands a
This data corroborates our recent checks We understand AC channel inventory
is approaching levels last seen in 2014 which preceded a decline in sales and
price cutting for some manufacturers in 2015 Mideas AC sales declined 11% in
2015 Should retail air conditioning sales continue to slow some industry players
believe price cutting could ensue
Improved inventory management system
On a positive note Midea has invested some RMB800m per year since 2015 to
develop an inventory management system to help it better track its inventory
Midea has 100 warehouses in China which ship AC units direct to retailers
Mideas own inventory levels are well controlled  the issue is with other
manufacturers who have been channel stuffing

High channel inventory levels and a high base effect into 1H19 will make an AC
ASP hike difficult for Midea in 2019 Recall that Midea achieved 10% ASP
growth in the AC category in 1H18 while ASP growth fell flat in 3Q18 Harder
indicate that channel inventory levels for washing machines and refrigerators
remain healthy
Stimulus details to boost home appliance
consumption by RMB700bn over 3 years
With fundamentals slowing Mideas share price rebound appears to be based
on market expectations of a consumer stimulus and an improving macro picture
Comments by Ning Jizhe vice chairman of the NDRC suggest that new policy
may be unrolled to boost consumption in China specifically for appliances and
While official details on the size and timing of a national program have yet to be
released news reports indicate that the NDRC estimates the policy may induce
additional spending of RMB700bn in 20192021 on energy efficient appliances
The program may target up to 15 different high-efficiency products including
refrigerators
We are skeptical that this round of stimulus will have an impact as significant as
the previous subsidies for two reasons
1) Assuming the RMB700bn figure is correct this round of stimulus will be
approximately half the size of former stimulus rounds which totaled
RMB14trn (See Figure 7)
2) Penetration of home appliance categories such as washing machines and
refrigerators is approaching peak levels However a stimulus could pull
forward some replacement demand and increase the penetration for some
categories such as ACs but it is unlikely to prove as impactful as in
previous rounds

Higher penetration levels today make a repeat of the 20092012 growth unlikely
Washing machines and refrigerators for example are approaching saturation
even in rural areas A stimulus could pull forward some replacement demand
particularly for refrigerators for which volume sales peaked in 20102012 Even
with a stimulus in effect we think washing machine and refrigerator volumes are
likely to grow only in low double-digit range For air conditioning we are slightly
less bullish on account of the high base for 2018 and current inventory overhang
 ACs (40% of revenue) Growth peaked at 37% in 2010 Following the
stimulus AC sales tracked the property market cycle  falling in 2015 and
spiking in 2H16 and 2017 when AC volumes grew 47%
The current domestic sales rate of 90m annual units is probably close to
peaking Assuming China has 450m households and assuming long term
that each household has 2 ACs on average this would require an installed
markets such as Taiwan Japan and Hong Kong typically have 135 150
and 225 ACs per 100 households vs Chinas 2017 urbanrural penetration
rates of 13053 respectively) Assuming each unit lasts for 1015 years
replacement demand would require 6090m units per year  below the
90m units sold in 20172018

Management indicated AC growth of 18% YoY in 9M18 Based on reported
AC growth of 32% in 1H18 this suggests negative growth for AC in 3Q18
According to management the ASP increase was flat in 3Q18 vs 10%
growth in 1H18
 Refrigerators ( 810% of revenue) Heavily impacted by consumption
stimulus Growth peaked in 2009 when refrigerator volume grew 51%
Demand was driven heavily by the rural market where penetration data
showed improvement in 20092011 Refrigerator volumes peaked in 2011 at
59m units and contracted steadily to 43m units in 2017
With 450m households in China with an average life cycle of 10 years and
with washing machines nearing 100% penetration we think production
volume of 45m units per year is a reasonable long-term run rate This
estimate is in line with 2018s 43m units of production
Mideas refrigerator volume grew 2% in 3Q18 (vs 8% in 9M18) but average
ASPs increased 15% YoY due to consumer upgrading
 Washing machines (810% of revenue) Growth peaked in 2010 when
volume increased 28% YoY to 34m units Since then annual domestic sales
increased steadily to 45m units as of 2018
Assuming 450m households in China a 10-year replacement rate and near
100% penetration we think that 45m units is close to Chinas long-term run
rate of washing machine consumption
Mideas washing machine sales (which consolidate Little Swan) grew 9% in
9M18 but declined 1% in 3Q18 The performance should improve in 4Q18
and into 1Q19 as new high-end models are introduced
 Small appliances (25% revenue) Mideas small appliances segment
includes a diverse array of products induction cookers pressure cookers
microwaves electric fans etc According to Mideas 3Q18 investor call small
appliances grew 5% in 9M18 but only 2% in 3Q18 Small appliance inventory
was high in 1H18 but inventory levels have normalized since 3Q18
Stimulus Scenario Sizing up the Potential Impact
Although the details are unclear we construct a scenario to estimate the impact
of a stimulus According to Mideas annual report the total market size of the
home appliance industry in 2017 was RMB1514bn Assuming Ex-KUKA
Mideas domestic sales are RMB150bn Mideas industry market share is 10%
across all products
Estimates of the potential stimulus impact are currently RMB700bn from 2019
to 2021 or RMB233bn per year Assuming Midea can capture a 10% share of
this mix we estimate that Midea could capture RMB20bn per year through
2021 We assume that the policy will take effect in 2H19
