Takeaways from retail banking corporate day
 We attended Ping An Banks (PAB) retail banking corporate day in Shenzhen
last week We see tremendous growth potential for the Banks retail business
as it benefits from Ping An Groups all-rounded supports and successful
migration of client base
 In the second stage of retail transformation PAB officially kicked off its
retail transformation in 2H16 with the foremost target of growing retail client
base (405 mn in FY16) and lifting retail revenue contribution (306% in FY16)
By end-FY18 no of client and proportion of revenue from retail segment
reached 839 mn and 53% respectively Since 4Q18 PAB has entered the
second stage of retail transformation (Figure 1) with key objective of
enhancing earnings ability A major initiative is to boost private banking and
wealth management businesses
 The core 321 framework PABs retail business is underpinned by a
management and one internal driver - Artificial Intelligence (AI) Basic retail
mainly supports customer acquisition and volume growth while consumer
finance and PB are major profit and AUM generators
 Comparison with Industry benchmark CMB (600036 CH NR) is broadly
multiple fronts of retail business including 1) revenue  profit mix 2)
structure  pricing of loans  deposits 3) NPL ratio 4) client amount  AUM
in retail profit and loan contribution but inferior in operating efficiency asset
quality and profitability
 4Q18 results highlights A bright spot was 13bps QoQ NIM expansion which
drove a 158% YoY revenue growth in 4Q18 Despite the 41% YoY surge in
impairment charges net profit still saw a decent growth of 70% YoY beating
most joint-stock peers It was also encouraging to see a notable increase in the
Banks NPL90-day overdue ratio (up 22ppts QoQ to 103%) which has been a
valuation overhang in past years Stricter NPL recognition will ease regulatory
risks and further unleash PABs earnings momentum ahead A major weakness
was the Banks thin capital buffer as CET-1 CAR only stood at 854% (vs 75%
threshold) in 4Q18
 Valuation PAB currently trades at 085x FY19E PB vs 087x for A-share bank
average and 134x for CMB-A There is foreseeable valuation upside should the
PAB is also a key beneficiary of further RRR cuts
