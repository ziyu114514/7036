CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Goertek (002241 CH)
Focus on VRARgaming business and margin
recovery in FY2425E
Following a challenging 2023 we expect AI-driven upgrade and ARVR product
launches will boost revenue and profitability recovery in FY24E and impact of
share loss of the major TWS project should normalise in 2H24E In the longer
term we believe Goertek will continue to benefit from ARVR secular trend with
more product launches from major players such as Meta Sony Google
Samsung and Huawei For FY23 revenueearnings decline of -6%-38% YoY
was mainly dragged by TWS order loss and weak VRAR demand but we are
encouraged by continued GPM recovery in 4Q23 (106% vs 77%101% in
2Q3Q23) To reflect FY23 results and gradual recovery in FY2425E we
trimmed FY2425E EPS by 9%11% and adjusted TP to RMB1756 based on
same 25x FY24E PE (7-yr hist avg) Maintain BUY
 202425 Outlook Riding on AIXR trend PS5Quest 3 ramp-up and
margin recovery For 2024 we are positive on shipment momentum of
PS5Quest 3 and stabilised hearable product segment and we also believe
Apples Vision Pro and edge-AI trend will accelerate ARVRXR product
cycle benefiting Goertek as a global ARVRXR OEM leader In 202425 we
Meta Sony Google Samsung and Huawei Overall we expect acoustics
rebound 4%9% YoY in FY24E (vs -7%-7% in FY23) while hearable
products (AirPods Android TWS) will drop 22% YoY in FY24E GPM will
recover to 105%105% in FY2425E (vs 89% in FY23E) given improving
utilization and hearable product margin recovery
 FY23 earnings bottoming with 4Q GPM recovery FY23 salesnet profit
decline of 6%38% YoY were mainly impacted by TWS share loss and
VRAR demand weakness but we are positive on improving 4Q GPM to
106% (vs 77%101% in 2Q3Q23) backed by better utilization and cost
segments posted -6%10%-23% YoY and GPM recovered to
204%84%87% in 2H23 (vs 206%41%59% in 1H23)
 Maintain BUY We think ARVR technology leadership and product roadmap
in TWSXRacousticsgaming segments will enable it to benefit from industry
recovery and new MR product cycle in FY2425E Maintain BUY with
launches and continued margin recovery
