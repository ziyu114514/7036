Weichai Power (000338 CH)
1Q24 net profit 40% YoY in line solid growth
While Weichai Power (Weichai)s revenue growth of 6% YoY in 1Q24 is below
our expectation net profit of RMB26bn (40% YoY) accounted for 214% of our
full-year estimates (run rate in 1Q23 205%) which is still in line with our
expectation The earnings growth was driven by margin expansion on both core
business and KION Group (KGX GR NR) We maintain Weichai as our sector
top pick given (1) the large gasdiesel price gap will continue to drive natural
gas engine demand where Weichai has 60% market share in (2) high-speed
large-bore engines will serve as a structural growth driver on the back of
construction of more data centres Maintain BUY with SOTP-based TP of
HK22RMB204 for Weichai HA
 1Q24 results highlights Weichais revenue grew 6% YoY to RMB564bn
Gross margin expanded 34ppt YoY to 221% in 1Q24 With limited increase
in SGA and RD expense ratio the pre-tax profit surged 58% YoY to
RMB42bn Based on our calculation the pretax profit of Weichais core
business  KION grew 45%  93% YoY in 1Q24 (in RMB terms) Operating
cash flow in 1Q24 substantially improved to RMB16bn vs outflow of
RMB471mn in 1Q23
 Margin recovery of KION Group KION (465% owned by Weichai)
reported adjusted EBIT of EUR227mn in 1Q24 (46% YoY) driven by
easing cost pressure KION guided a full-year adjusted EBIT target of
EUR790-940mn (up 0-19% YoY)
 Weichais engine sales outpaced industry in 1Q24 According to
CICEIA Weichais multi-cylinder sales (HDT construction machinery other
engines) grew 13% YoY to 206k units in 1Q24 (vs the industry average of a
decline of 1%) with market share of 18% (23ppt YoY)
 Risk factors 1) weakness in engine exports 2) lower-than-expected
