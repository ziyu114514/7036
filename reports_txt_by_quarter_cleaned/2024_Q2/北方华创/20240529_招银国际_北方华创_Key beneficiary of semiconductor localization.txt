CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Naura Technology (002371 CH)
Key beneficiary of semiconductor localization
We recently held an NDR with Naura Technologys management and we
maintain our positive outlook for the Company We expect Naura to deliver
robust revenue growth on capex expansion from downstream clients and
accelerated semi localization trend In addition we believe the Company
could be one of the beneficiaries of the recently launched Big Fund III
(US475bn) in China Naura is currently our favourite under the semi
localization theme Reiterate BUY rating for Naura (002371 CH) with an
unchanged TP at RMB405
 Geopolitical tensions have driven major economies worldwide to pursue
resilience over efficiency leading to significant investments to strengthen
domestic chip fabrication capabilities The recently established Big Fund
III (US475bn) in China is so far the largest phase of the series with
registered capital of RMB344bn (vs Phase III RMB139bnRMB200bn)
The phase III underscores yet another Chinese governments effort to
achieve self-sufficiency in semi amid the escalating geopolitical tensions
Previous phases focused on chip fabrication equipment materials etc
and we expect similar investment interests for Phase III as well as a
potential focus on AI-related areas We expect Naura to be one of the
beneficiaries
 Looking forward Naura will likely maintain robust growth on capex
expansion from clients and accelerated semi localization trend Key
drivers of revenue could be from order wins in CCP CVD and cleanser
products The Company disclosed that new orders signed in 2023 were
RMB30bn of which 70% were for semiconductor equipment and 15%
were for new energyPV We think these orders will support 40% revenue
growth in 2024
 We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura (002371 CH) with an
unchanged TP at RMB405 based on the same 39x 2024E PE We
raise our GPM forecasts by 19ppt and 39ppt for 202425E considering
larger revenue contribution from more advanced equipment This
accretive impact on net profit was offset by a higher projection for RD
spending (11% of total revenue) as the Company is expanding its
domestic peers and 2) escalating geopolitical tensions

National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (The
The National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund known as the Big Fund was
created in 2014 with registered capital of RMB139bn The initial phase focused on
developing Chinas semi manufacturing capabilities with major investments directing
towards leading Chinese semi foundries such as SMIC (688951 CH) and Hua Hong Semi
(1347 HK) Additionally the fund supported other parts of the semi ecosystem such as
materials and equipment laying the groundwork for a more self-sufficient semi industry
According to ijiweis analysis 67% of the fund was invested in IC manufacturing 17% in
chip design 10% in packaging and 6% in equipment and materials
Big Fund II was launched in 2019 significantly expanding its scope and financial flexibility
with registered capital of RMB200bn This phase shifted its focus to strengthening the
upstream semi supply chain particularly in equipment and materials Investments were
testing equipment Phase II also aimed to further reduce Chinas reliance on foreign tech
and support domestic semi solutions
Big Fund III is so far the largest phase of the series with registered capital of RMB344bn
This phase underscores yet another Chinese governments effort to achieve self-
sufficiency in semi amid the escalating geopolitical tensions The investments are likely to
further the previous objectives (advanced materials manufacturing capacity and
equipment etc) while potentially adding other critical areas in AI developments
