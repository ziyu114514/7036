CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
SANY Heavy (600031 CH)
2023 net profit a miss 1Q24 still weak Stay on
SANY Heavy (SANY)s net profit in 2023 came in at RMB453bn (6% YoY)
which is 12% below both our and consensus estimates In addition net profit in
1Q24 only grew 5% YoY to RMB158bn due to a lack of revenue growth (-1%
YoY) We are still concerned about further slowdown of export this year given
the weakness in the overseas demand (in particular in Europe) We maintain
our 2024E earnings forecast but revise up our 2025E estimates by 8% as we
take into consideration a moderate recovery in Chinas market Still our new
estimates remain 24%29% below consensus Maintain HOLD with new TP of
RMB148 based on 24x 2024E PE
 4Q23 results below expectations Revenue declined 17% YoY to
RMB179bn Gross margin narrowed 19ppt YoY to 256% EBIT was
RMB698mn (-25% YoY) largely helped by a fair value gain of RMB602mn
Net profit dropped by 29% YoY to RMB480mn
 Slowdown of overseas revenue in 2H23 Overseas revenue in 2H23
(62% of SANYs revenue) grew 4% YoY to RMB208bn (slowed from 36%
in 1H23) In terms of region Europe grew 15% YoY to RMB81bn (39% of
overseas revenue) Asia Pacific (ex-China) remained stable at RMB76bn
(36% of overseas) Both America and Africa revenue dropped 6% YoY in
2H23 (17%7% of overseas)
 Sluggish 1Q24 results Revenue dropped 1% YoY while gross margin
expanded 05ppt to 284% Helped by lower RD and administrative
expense ratio net profit grew 5% YoY to RMB158bn On the positive side
operating cash flow improved significantly to RMB438bn (vs -RMB16bn in
 Valuation We revise up our TP to RMB148 based on 24x 2024E PE
which is equivalent to 05SD above the average of 20x since 2017 (previous
TP RMB123 based on 19x) We now apply an above average target
multiple as we see initial signs of stabilisation of excavator sales in Chinas
market and we expect a moderate recovery in 2025E
 Upside risk stabilization of property investment in China Downside risk
further slowdown of overseas demand
