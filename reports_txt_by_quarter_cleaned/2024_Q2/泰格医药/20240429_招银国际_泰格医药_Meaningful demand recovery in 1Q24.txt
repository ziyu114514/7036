Tigermed (300347 CH)
Meaningful demand recovery in 1Q24
Tigermed reported 1Q24 revenue of RMB1660mn down 80% YoY and
mainly due to the substantially reduced gains on fair value changes and
investment changes (RMB8mn in 1Q24 vs RMB198mn in 1Q23) 1Q24 revenue
our 2024 full-year estimates which were largely in line with its pre-COVID
COVID vaccine related revenue Gross profit margin (GPM) in 1Q24 was 378%
significantly improved by 50ppt QoQ driven by ongoing cost management
measures as well as the MoM GPM improvements of its lab services According
to mgt GPM would be 385% in 1Q24 flat QoQ if excluding COVID vaccine
25-30% QoQ in 2Q24 considering the accelerated revenue conversion from
contracts and the cost control measures
 Demand experiencing meaningful recovery in 1Q24 According to mgt
1Q24 contract signings rebounded to double-digit growth with Mar showing
into April Specifically orders from MNC and domestic pharma clients
contributed to a notably larger proportion in total orders while orders from
the US and Australia remain robust Encouragingly there are signs of
recovery in orders from domestic biotech firms thanks to the recovery of
biotech funding Tigermeds BD team will continue to focus on exploring
opportunities from MNC and domestic pharma clients
 Strengthening cost control Tigermed plans to continue its cost control on
SGA expenses and GPM optimization Mgt indicated that with its asset-
light business model Tigermed possesses ample leverage on cost controls
which for instance include increasing the utilization of decentralized clinical
end-2023) establishing integrated teams within specific therapeutic areas
and reallocating personnel across departments as needed
 Globalization remaining a high priority In the global market Tigermed
overseas local clients with limited access to international CRO services The
in multiple projects with US local clients Tigermed intends to further
expand team sizes in the US and India to enhance its global operation
 Maintain BUY We trim our TP from RMB6857 to RMB6682 based on a
10-year DCF model (WACC 1095% terminal growth 20%) to factor in
the slower earnings projection and uncertainties in demand recovery pace
We forecast Tigermeds revenue to grow 113% 162% 206% YoY and
25E 26E respectively
