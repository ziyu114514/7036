online sales made up the gap but
unavoidably diluted GPM - 4 Nov

UpDownside
Owing to a weak but expected 4Q earnings CTGDFs recent share price has
pulled back by 10% to its pre-reopening level While lockdown risk has already
behind us we again see buying opportunity when earnings momentum in our
view troughed and subsequently picks up within 1H23E Our call is further
supported by channel check findings in which 1) YTD DF sales still tracking 20%
2) inelastic procurement demand from reseller given the prevailing logistic
bottleneck and less favorable rebate policy with Korea DF and 3) a very
disciplined discount policy We are buyers of CTGDF and believe the stock would
see a relief rally towards result season driven by managements 2023 outlook
and sentiment recovery towards the 51 Golden week
 We raise 2023E revenue by 9% mainly driven by 1) a net 9% higher airport
DF revenue of RMB166bn (offset by lower online revenue) which we assert
offline foot traffic and spending per visitor to generally recover to c55% of 2019
and 2) Hainan offshore revenue of RMB623bn in which we assume CTGDF
to share 78% of Hainan governments target of RMB80bn These however
were mitigated by a 02pp ramp up in opex ratio and hence a muted net profits
change Our 2023E forecasts remain c25% below consensus
 4Q was below us but momentum has been normalizing Although net
profits came in below us consensus revenue has showed a 29% sequential
QoQ improvement While results details were not available we expect the
quarters GPM to show similar trend given 1) discounts has started to narrow
from mid-Dec in view of better foot traffic upon the removal of social distancing
policy and 2) a rising contribution from accessories of which a higher GPM is
supported by better pricing dynamics Meanwhile these were likely eroded by
start-up costs induced by the new Haikou shopping mall
 Valuation Our earnings is little changed Our TP is still based on 500x end-
23E PE which represents its average since June 2020 when market started
to re-rate the stock for a series of policy tailwind We believe our methodology
has appropriately priced-in the recent market sentiment about Chinas gradual
reopening progress
 Positive catalysts domestic and overseas acquisition sentiment recovery
towards 51 Golden week
