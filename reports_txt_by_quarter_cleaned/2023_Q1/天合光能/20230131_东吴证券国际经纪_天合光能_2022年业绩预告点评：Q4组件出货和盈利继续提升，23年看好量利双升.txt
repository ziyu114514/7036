n TSs PV module shipments increased rapidly and the profit per watt reached a new
high We estimate that TSs PV module shipments have increased by 75% YoY to 43GW
in 2022 and reached 13GW in 22Q4 We estimate that the profit per watt has increased
by 001 RmbW QoQ to 009 RmbW bringing profit of Rmb11-12bn in 22Q4 The
record profit per watt was mainly due to the reduction in polysilicon wafer prices and
freight rates TS expect that its PV module shipments will increase by 50% YoY to
60-65GW in 2023 We are optimistic about TSs profitability in 2023 1) Highly-priced
existing orders and rapidly decreasing raw material prices will help improve profitability
2) We expect TSs TOPCon cells to ship about 20GW in 2023 and enjoy a new
technology premium 3) Wafer capacity expansion helps reduce costs
n TSs distributed system is highly profitable and energy storage business has begun
to turn losses into profits We expect that TSs distributed system has shipped 6-65GW
in 2022 and 2GW in 22Q4 with profit per watt at 016 RmbW With the expected
decline of PV module prices in 2023 IRR of distributed PV system will likely increase
We expect that TSs distributed PV system shipment will increase by 45% YoY to
9-10GW TSs solar panel mounts have shipped 43-45GW in 2022 of which 17-18GW
of tracking mounts We expect that TSs solar panel mount shipments will increase by
100% YoY to 7-8GW in 2023 TSs energy storage business mainly engages in the field
of domestic large-scale energy storage TSs energy storage product shipments in 2022
were 18-2GWh and in 22Q4 quickly reached a large volume of about 15GWh turning
losses into profits We expect that TSs energy storage products shipments will be about
3-4GWh in 2023 generating positive profits
n Earnings Forecast  Rating We maintain Buy rating with TP at Rmb987
(corresponding to PE ratio at 30x in 2023) considering TSs quickly increasing
shipments of PV modules and energy storage products We revise up TSs earning
forecast and expect that the net profit will increase by 108%90%35% YoY to
Rmb375714965bn (previous value at Rmb370661906bn) in 202220232024
