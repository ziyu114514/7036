UpDownside
We see trading opportunity on Yili into results season This would mainly be
underpinned by 1) an easy and stabilizing earnings expectation (for both 4Q22
and 2023E) when we see subdued downside risk to current consensus estimates
and 2) a lagging valuation to peers who have already been re-rated on reopening
sentiment We argue the stock could play near term catch-up when a likely in
line 4Q could relieve market sentiment We are buy-rated on Yili but prefer to
stick to CR Beer (291HK Buy) Proya (603605CH Buy) and CTGDF (601888CH
Buy) as our preferred plays around this early-staged consumption-led recovery
 4Q momentum showed sequential pick-up We forecast 4Q revenue to
grow 6% YoY to RMB27bn Momentum in October and November has been
weak and a more obvious recovery has kicked-in in December This was
driven by acceleration of liquid milk demand as a result of healthy restocking
momentum for the CNY in Jan 2023 GPM is likely to show QoQ improvement
thanks to higher gifting demand that improved sales mix Opex ratio will
decline YoY without much eventful spending (winter Olympic last year)
Meanwhile we expect a flattish NPM at 8% for 2022
 2023E outlook Overall we expect revenue growth to edge up from 2022E
driven by accelerated liquid milk sales from flattish in 2022 to about 5%
growth in 2023E IMF business should remain high-growth but from a high
base of 2022 we assert a 25% YoY growth for the segment This is consistent
with management target of a 20% 4-year CAGR between 2021-25E While
birth rate looks to have troughed we do not expect it to rebound until late-23E
In this case given a muted segment growth we would expect Yili to take up
market share from peers For instance Yili took up 11% of the market by end-
30% YoY growth and we consider the temperature of summer this year the
major swing factor to our assumption
 Earnings change Our 2022E estimates are largely unchanged We have
lowered our 2023E GPM by 04pp and this led to a 42% cut in net profits
Now we assume Yilis net margins to expand by an average of 05pp over
2023-24E and this largely tallies with managements expectation
 Valuation Our new TP is based on an unchanged 250x rolled-forward end-23E
PE which still benchmarks to its 3-year average We believe our methodology
appropriately reflects Yilis sequential recovery that begins from 4Q22
