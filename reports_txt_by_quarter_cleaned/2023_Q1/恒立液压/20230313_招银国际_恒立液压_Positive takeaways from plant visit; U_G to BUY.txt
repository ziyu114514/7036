CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH)
Positive takeaways from plant visit UG to BUY
We upgrade Hengli to BUY from Hold for the first time since May 2021 We
are turning positive after visiting Henglis production base last week In the near
cylinder production in Mar after going through a declining trend since late 2021
suggests an early sign of turnaround of downstream demand Besides
production of AWP motor in Mar is expected to reach a record high which
reaffirms our positive stance on AWP From a long-term perspective (1-3
years) continuous market share gain in pump  valves as well as penetration
(estimated annual output value of RMB15-20bn) in 3Q23E will help speed up
the penetration in the US market We revise up our 2023E24E earnings forecast
by 1%10% Our TP is raised to RMB90 based on 42x 2023E PE 1SD above
the 4-year average of 30x to reflect the acceleration of earnings growth
 Excavator hydraulic cylinder growth turns positive in Mar We
understand that Hengli has scheduled production of 64k units of excavator
hydraulic cylinder in Mar which represents 12% growth YoY We believe
the growth is largely driven by Chinese OEMs orders
 Growth of excavator pump  valve to continue in 2023E While Hengli
has high market share in pump  valve for small-size excavator (50%) the
share in medium-large size excavator is only 15% We see a high chance
for Hengli to achieve further market share gain given the solid track record
in cylinder pump  valve (small-size)
motors pumps  valves for agricultural machinery such as cotton pickers
that of excavator given the continuous operation of the pumping system
This implies a large aftersales market Against the backdrop of supply chain
disruption in Europe Hengli captures the opportunity of penetrating into the
achieve RMB500mn revenue in overseas in 2023E (up 100% YoY) In
China market we expect the import substitution trend will offer large growth
potential given the low base
 AWP motor Surprise on the upside Henglis production volume of motor
(largely for AWP) is expected to reach 23k in Mar representing 90%
growth We see potential for Hengli to continue to penetrate into the global
AWP motor market as overseas AWP OEMs are facing supply chain
bottleneck As a cross check Henglis strong production figure in Mar also
reaffirms our bullish view on Zhejiang Dingli (603338 CH BUY)
