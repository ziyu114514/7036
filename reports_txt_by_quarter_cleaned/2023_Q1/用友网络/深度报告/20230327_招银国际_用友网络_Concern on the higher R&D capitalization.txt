CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Yonyou (600588 CH)
Concern on the higher RD capitalization
SELL (Down)
Yonyou reported FY4Q22 revenue of RMB367bn (-8% YoY) and net profit of
RMB759mn (31% YoY) missed our consensus estimates by 13 17%
respectively The weakness was due to COVID-19 resurgence and GPM
erosion given higher staff cost and outsourcing expenses For cloud segment
revenue showed no YoY growth although ARR was up 238% YoY ARR
contribution to cloud revenue was stable at 32% (vs 58% for Kingdee) which
suggested majority of Yonyous cloud revenue is not recurring We are also
concerned with the increasing RD capitalization rate to record-high of 48%
Deteriorating earnings quality could result in share price de-rating
Downgrade from HOLD to SELL
 FY4Q22 missed with no growth in cloud revenue Yonyou reported
weak FY4Q22 results with revenue of RMB367bn (-8% YoY) and net
profit of RMB759mn (31% YoY) both missing our and consensus
estimates Cloud service revenue showed no growth at RMB281bn
accounting for 77% of revenue while Software business continued to
shrink (-29% YoY) Operating profit was RMB750mn (-19% YoY) and
lower opex ratio at 391% (-36 pcts) was offset by the decline in GPM (-
63 pcts YoY to 595%) Yonyou attributed the GPM erosion to higher
staff cost (no of employee 21% YoY in 4Q22) and outsourcing
 Customer mix has limited the ARR and cloud revenue visibility
Although ARR growth remained steady (238% YoY to RMB204bn)
ARR accounted for only 32% of cloud revenue similar to the 31% in
FY21 This implied majority of Yonyous cloud revenue is not charged on
subscription basis and is not recurring in nature This could be explained
with Yonyous customer mix that skewed towards large-sized enterprises
(69% of FY22 cloud service revenue) The customization demand from
large-sized enterprises will limit the ARR and its cloud revenue visibility
 RD capitalization rate hit record-high of 48% In FY22 Yonyou
increased RD expenditure by 24% YoY to RMB293bn as the
Company continues to develop cloud-native products RD capitalization
rate rose to record-high of 48% (vs 36% in FY21 vs Kingdees 33% in
FY22) Assuming all RD are being expensed Yonyou suffered from net
loss of RMB118bn in FY22 significantly widened from net loss of
RMB137mn in FY21 We are concerned with the deteriorating earnings
 Downgrade from HOLD to SELL We cut FY23-24E net profit by 7-9%
to reflect lower cloud revenue growth and GPM Downgrade to SELL with
new target price of RMB1956 (prior RMB2227) based on unchanged
60x FY23E EVsales
