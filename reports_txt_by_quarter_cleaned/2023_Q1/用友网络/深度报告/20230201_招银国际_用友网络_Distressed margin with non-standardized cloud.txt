CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Yonyou (600588 CH)
Distressed margin with non-standardized cloud
Yonyou announced preliminary FY22 net profit of RMB200-220mn (-689-717%
YoY) The weakness was attributable to COVID resurgence and FY4Q22 and higher
RD spending While Yonyous business is slowly recovering in FY23E we remain
cautious on its cloud migration progress as its large enterprise customers (68% of
revenue) are less willing to adopt standardized cloud model Customization would
result in higher RD and thus limiting business scalability and margin upside from
cloud migration
 Yonyou preliminary FY22 missed on COVID-resurgence and higher RD
expenses Yonyou announced FY22 preliminary net profit ranged from
RMB200-220mn (down 689-717% YoY) missed consensus estimate of
RMB505mn The was attributable to 1) COVID resurgence in FY4Q22 and 4Q
usually accounts for 45% of full-year revenue 2) higher RD and 3) FY21
recorded one-off disposal gain of RMB214mn FY22 core revenue (software 
cloud) delivered YoY increase but the growth rate was lower than that in FY21
(16% YoY) We think the FY4Q22 top-line weakness is largely anticipated but
the RD surge is not
 Business slowly recovering in Jan Yonyous subsidiary Chanjet targets
30% YoY top-line growth in FY23E Yonyous HK-listed subsidiary Chanjet
(1588 HK) also announced FY22 profit warning Yonyous business targeting
small micro enterprises is operated through Chanjet (Yonyou owns 6185%
stake) Chanjet FY22 revenue was up 12-18% YoY while SaaS subscription
revenue grew 45% YoY Implied FY4Q22 revenue was down 18% YoY to
RMB180mn (vs 34% YoY in FY9M22) Management hosted a conference call
targets to achieve 30% YoY in top-line growth and to break-even in FY23E
This suggested RMB883mn revenue contribution by small micro enterprises to
Yonyou missed our prior forecast of RMB11bn
 Customization for large-enterprises adds margin pressure We keep our
view that Yonyous cloud migration path is tough with it large enterprise-focused
strategy (68% of revenue) as these customers (mostly SOEs) are less willing to
adopt a standardized cloud model The demand for customization would result
in extra IT services work This is in-line with our observation that Yonyou has
increased its workforce by 4000 people (20% YoY) to over 25000 even in
revenue operating profit generated per employee has been decreasing (fig5-
6) and 2) RD capitalization rate was up from about 20% to 35%
 Maintain HOLD We cut FY22-24E revenue by 5-6% and derived new target
price of RMB2227 (prior RMB2351) based on unchanged 60x FY23E

Preliminary FY22 results key points
Yonyou preliminary FY22 net profit missed
FY22 net profit attributable to owners of the parent ranges from RMB200mn to RMB220mn
(down 689-717% YoY) Excluding non-recurring items net profit would range between
RMB85-105mn (down 741-790% YoY) The decline in net profit was resulted from
1) COVID resurgence in FY4Q22
Project delivery usually takes place in 4Q 4Q usually accounted for 45%
of full year revenue The COVID resurgence especially in Dec 2022 has
resulted in new contract sign and project implementation delay
FY22 core revenue (software  cloud) delivered YoY increase but the
growth rate was lower than that in FY21 (16% YoY)
2) RD expenses increased with structural change in workforce
Due to the increasing demand in digitalization and localization Yonyou
added 4000 employees in FY22 resulting in an increase of RD
expenses Meanwhile Yonyou spent more opex to boost IT partners
project delivery capability in order to fulfil large customers demand in
software customization
Yonyou plans to raise the profit sharing ratio with their IT partners going
forward to enhance profitability
