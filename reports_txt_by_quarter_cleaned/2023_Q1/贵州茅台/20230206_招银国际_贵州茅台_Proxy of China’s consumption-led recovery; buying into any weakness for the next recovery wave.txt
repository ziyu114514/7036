As the proxy of China consumption we think Moutai is undoubtedly well-positioned
to benefit from the current consumption-driven recovery This will not only be
underpinned by reopening of restaurants and resumption of social events but also
(with the launch of 100ml Flying Fairy aka Feitian SKU) registering RMB15bn
2022 revenue (16% of total) with 30mn active users and 2) a more diversified
sales mix from Series baijiu with core products such as Moutai 1935 Moutai Prince
Classics (茅台王子酒酱香经典) Moutai Prince Gold (茅台金王子) etc Meanwhile we
are wary of the capacity bottleneck of both Moutai Series baijiu which has been a
known drag to growth That said without a legit substitute we view this an ongoing
opportunity for Moutai to monetize this excess demand through gradual price hike
until the announced capacity expansion (Moutai Series baijiu to 71k 56k ton)
improvises a multi-year growth story (in both price and volume) in which we project
16% 17% 3-year revenue net profits CARG between 2022-25E respectively with
a steadily improving GPM We are buy-rated with a refreshed TP at RMB2440
upon coverage transfer We think shares could take a breather after the bull-run
which growth is likely to re-accelerate from 2Q onwards
 Major earnings assumptions 4Q22 revenue net profits stood at RMB3718bn This
adds up 2022 revenue net profits to RMB1272626bn respectively Referring to the
announcement we project 2023E revenue to grow at 177% thanks to 166% growth
in Moutai baijiu and 277% in Series baijiu We further assume 8% YoY volume growth
to 41k tons for the former and 14% YoY growth to 38k tons for the latter
 Channel check on Lunar New Year demand dynamics Moutai recorded
MSD to HSD sales growth with strong momentum seen in Series SKUs ASP
for sealed Flying Fairy Feitian was RMB2970 per case while that for
unsealed was RMB2780 about RMB100 higher than those by end-22
 Valuation With minor earnings change our TP of RMB2440 (from RMB2447)
is based on 410x end-23E PE (from 537x mid-22) which represents long-term
average since 2019 (since 2017) Our methodology reflects our relative optimism
(vis-a-vis other FB diversified of which target multiples are based on -1sd below
long term average) that Moutai is one of the core beneficiaries standing at the
forefront of Chinas reopening with high certainty in earnings support
