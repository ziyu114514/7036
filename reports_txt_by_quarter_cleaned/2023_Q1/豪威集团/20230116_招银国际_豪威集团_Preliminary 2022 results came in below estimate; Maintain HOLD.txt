showing 732% to 821% YoY decline Even a weak 4Q22 was already widely
anticipated the results came in significantly below ourconsensus forecasts of
RMB246bnRMB297bn The mgmt attributed the miss to 1) weak consumer
electronic market demand (lower rev and margin) 2) an inventory write down of
RMB13bn to RMB15bn (as a result of high inventory base) We see no clear
sign of recovery of consumer electronic demand in near-term maintain HOLD
and revise TP to RMB72
 Smartphone demand will remain weak due to ongoing macroeconomics
pressure Entering into 2023 worldwide economic environment remains
challenged while re-opening in China may boost economy However we
expect its overall impact on consumer electronic demand will be limited in
short-term In other words smartphonePC will not be the top spending
smartphone shipment is projected to grow only 2%26% YoY according to
CounterpointIDC despite a low base in 2022 (c11% decline) Although 4Q22
may be the worst quarter for Willsemi we think the low growth of smartphone
market will cap the Companys topline recovery in 2023 (44% of CIS rev
contribution from mobile)
 Inventory digestion continues however not necessary a hint of market
turnaround The mgmt expected the inventory level would decrease
meaningfully in 4Q While inventory digestion will continue in 1Q23 it does
not necessarily mean the downstream OEMs will increase their orders
significantly At this stage of the cycle we think any meaningful change in
market confidence (demand side) would be a more valuable catalyst for the
supply chain (earnings upside and potential revaluation) than a gradually
decreasing inventory level (supply side)
 Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB72 As 4Q22 results came in lower than
estimates we think demand pressure will persist into 1H23 We revised down
2023E EPS by 8% The new TP of RMB72 is based on the same 293x 2023E
PE Potential upside include earlier-than-expected consumer demand
