Jingsheng announced last night that the Company won a contract of RMB608bn
from Ningxia Zhonghuan (a subsidiary of Zhonghuan 002129 CH NR) to
deliver automated crystal growing furnaces We see this as a big positive to
Jingsheng given that the contract amount represents an addition of 53% on top
of Jingshengs backlog of RMB115bn (as at end-Jun 2021) The new contract
reaffirms our confidence on the robust solar capex story Given that Jingsheng
will start the product delivery to Ningxia Zhonghuan in Nov 2021 we revise up
our 2022E-23E earnings forecast by 17% for each year We revise up our TP to
RMB112 Reiterate BUY with conviction
 Details of the contract On 31 Aug Jingsheng signed a sales contract with
Ningxia Zhonghuan Jingsheng will deliver automated crystal growing furnace
to Ningxia Zhonghuan The contract value reaches RMB608bn (VAT-
included) Product delivery will begin in Nov 2021 while the actual delivery
schedule will be subject to Ningxia Zhonghuans notice Cash collection will
be divided into five stages (1) down-payment (2) product delivery (3) product
acceptance (4) testing and (5) warranty
 Jingsheng continues to be the major beneficiary of Zhonghuans
aggressive capex growth Zhonghuan has been Jingshengs largest
customer According to Zhonghuans latest share placement plan Zhonghuan
plans to raise a total of RMB9bn to finance the capex on 50GW of G12 mono-
wafer capacity Ningxia Zhonghuan will be the entity to execute the project
The construction lead time is expected to be 15 months Therefore we
forecast the revenue contribution to Jingsheng will be in 2022E-23E
 TP revised up We lift our TP to RMB112 from RMB775 as we roll over our
valuation base to 2022E as the solid backlog offers good visibility to the
earnings in 2022E-23E Our new TP is based on 56x FY22E earnings on the
back of 56% EPS CAGR in 2021E-23E (equivalent to 1x PEG)
 Risk 1) Weaker or slower-than-expected solar power capacity expansion 2)
lower-than-expected gross margin (3) unsuccessful acquisition
