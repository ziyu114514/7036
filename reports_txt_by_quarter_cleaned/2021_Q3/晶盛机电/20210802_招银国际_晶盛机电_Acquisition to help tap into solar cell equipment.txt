Jingsheng announced last Friday that the Company will set up a JV with Applied
Materials (AMAT US) The JV will acquire from Applied Materials the screen
printing equipment business in Italy wafer inspection business in Singapore and
the related business in China This is an important move for Jingsheng to expand
its product mix on wafer equipment More importantly the acquisition can help
Jingsheng to tap into the solar cell equipment field immediately We see strong
manufacturing capability of Jingsheng Reiterate BUY
 Key highlights of the acquisition Jingsheng will set up a JV with Applied
Materials Hong Kong (stake Jingsheng 65% Applied Materials 35%) The
total registered capital will be US150mn (RMB970mn) The JV will then
acquire from Applied Materials the screen printing equipment business in Italy
wafer inspection business in Singapore and the related business in China for
a consideration of US120mn (RMB775mn) This implies 5x PB (equity at
end-Jan 2021 US242mn) The board of the JV will include five members
including three representatives from Jingsheng and two from Applied
Materials The acquisition is subject to the approval by the authorities in both
China and Italy
 A major move to expand playing fields The inclusion of wafer inspection
equipment will expand Jingshengs product offerings (current focus crystal
growing and wafer slicing) On the other hand screen printing equipment will
present Suzhou Maxwell (300751 CH NR) is the leading screen printer
maker in China (see our note Leading screen printing equipment maker
penetrating into HJT cell production equipment link) We believe by
leveraging Applied Materials technology and Jingsheng manufacturing
capability Jingsheng will be capable to challenge the incumbent
 TP revised up We maintain our earnings forecast but lift our TP to RMB775
from RMB6090 based on 67x FY21E PE equivalent to 14x PEG (previously
11x) Our higher target PEG is to reflect the additional growth potential from
the latest acquisition and the recent breakthroughs in the 12-inch crystal
growing furnace in semiconductor segment
 Risk 1) Weaker or slower-than-expected solar power capacity expansion 2)
lower-than-expected gross margin (3) unsuccessful acquisition
