Hikvision FY2Q21 beat our estimates as revenue continued to rebound strongly
(34% YoY) Key highlight of FY1H21 is the innovative business (1) revenue
grew 122% YoY to RMB56bn (16% of revenue) and (2) gross margin 31 pct
pts YoY to 42% (vs core surveillance 47%) Also high inventory level strategy
helps secure customers amid global raw material shortage Maintain BUY and
raised target price to RMB8000 (prior RMB7565)
 FY2Q21 beat Revenue was at RMB199bn (34% YoY) and net profit was
at RMB43bn (38% YoY) GPM missed (-53 pct pts YoY to 459%) on higher
raw material price and product mix change Opex control was better than
expected with opex ratio of 264% (vs CMBI estimate 281%) RD expense
increased 19% YoY while GA expense declined 8% YoY Net profit was
boosted by tax credit (RMB570mn) that usually came in 3Q instead of 2Q On
operating level profit was up 26% YoY to RMB39bn
 Innovative business taking shape We maintain our view that Hikvision is
embedding AI sensor technology Innovative business segments (smart
home products robotics thermal x-ray products etc) revenue was up 122%
YoY to RMB56bn in FY1H21 and revenue contribution reached 16% It is also
positive to see innovative business GPM improvement (31 pct pts to 416%
in FY1H21) narrowing the gap with core surveillance GPM 472%
 High raw material level ensures stable supply to customers Hikvision has
adopted high inventory level strategy since Hisilicon ban in 2019 This helps
secure customers in FY1H21 amid global raw material shortage especially
for SMBG (revenue 106% YoY) and overseas business (26%YoY)
Inventory level increased further to RMB151bn (35% YoY) in FY2Q21 of
which RMB69bn are raw materials (35% YoY) Customers are accepting
shorter credit period to ensure stable supply and thus AR days shortened to
114 in FY2Q21 (vs 139 in FY2Q20) However if raw material price hike
persists Hikvision could face increasing margin pressure
 Maintain BUY We raised FY21-23E net profit by 5-7% to reflect stronger top-
line growth and better opex control Maintain BUY with new target price of
RMB8000 (based on unchanged 36x FY22 PE) Key downside risk is that
chip shortage may last for longer than expected

Hikvision (002415 CH BUY TP RMB8000)
We raised our target price to RMB8000 (prior RMB7565) based on unchanged 36x FY22
PE 50% above its 3-year mean We believe Hikvision deserves re-rating as supply chain
risk is mitigated after two years of product re-design Also strong growth in innovative
business proves Hikvision transformation to an intelligent camera solution provider rather
business (Ezviz Network) on STAR board We believe the spin-off could provide new
financing channel to support IoT AI RD
