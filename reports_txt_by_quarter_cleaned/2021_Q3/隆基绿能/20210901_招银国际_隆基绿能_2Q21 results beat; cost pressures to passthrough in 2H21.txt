LONGis 1H212Q21 results beat our expectation despite the chaotic operating
environment during the period The Company managed to pass through
upstream cost pressures through a series of price hike and Poly-Si inventory
also helped sustain 1H21 gross profit margin (declined only 09ppt QoQ) Mgmt
was cautious about 2H21 outlook but we think pressures can still be passed
through as wafer price is now standing at year high We cut TP slightly from
RMB110 to RMB105 reflecting 396x FY22E PER Maintain BUY
 2Q21 results beat LONGi realized 1H21 revenue of RMB35bn up 67% YoY
Revenue growth was mainly driven by module sales volume increased by
1524% YoY Selling expenses exhibited significant increment due to
overseas shipping costs hike while other major expenses remained largely
stable 1H21 net profit was RMB4993mn up 21% YoY implying 2Q21 net
profit of RMB2491mn largely flat as 1Q21 In view of chaotic supply chain
and sluggish downstream demand we appreciate LONGis performance and
the result beat our expectations
 Cost pressures to pass through to downstream LONGi realized
surprisingly good wafer margin during 1H21 through 1) releasing low cost
Poly-Si inventory and 2) passing through cost pressures via price hike We
estimate the Company boosted ASP by more than 42% through six rounds of
price hike in 1H21 which successfully sustained the Companys profitability
Looking forward since effective wafer supply is constrained by Poly-Si input
we expect the cost pass-through mechanism will continue until cell
manufacturers cannot afford and that will likely sustain wafer margin in 2H21E
 Full year direction still on course LONGi maintained full year shipment
target of 80GW wafer40GW module unchanged and realized run rate of
48%43% respectively in 1H21 Mgmt saw module sales challenging as
module price had increased to critical level at RMB180watt and further price
hike will suppress grid-parity solar installation demand During 1H21 low price
order signed in 4Q20 had squeezed module GPM In 2H21E as module ASP
picks up and reflects upstream costs movement we expect module pressure
to be eased Supported by advantages of integrated supply chain we expect
LONGi to achieve its ambitious module sales target
 Trim TP slightly to RMB105 LONGi is trading at 38x34x FY2122E PER
leading solar peers Valuation looks a bit rich but we think LONGi is still on a rapid
expanding track Based on 396x FY22 PER we derive our TP of RMB105
Maintain BUY

 Hydrogen equipment a new direction LONGi established a new team for
hydrogen business The Company will position itself as hydrogen equipment
and solution provider in near term to explore business potential of the new
15-2GW hydrogen equipment manufacturing capacity by end-2022
 Lift earnings outlook by 43-65% in FY21-23E Based on revision on wafer and
module price assumption and LONGis unexpected high cost pass-through
capability we lifted FY21-23E earnings slightly by 43%52%65% to
RMB107941435317453mn respectively
 Risk factors 1) PV installation demand turns weak in 4Q21 2) potential
wafer price war flips cost pass-through mechanism
