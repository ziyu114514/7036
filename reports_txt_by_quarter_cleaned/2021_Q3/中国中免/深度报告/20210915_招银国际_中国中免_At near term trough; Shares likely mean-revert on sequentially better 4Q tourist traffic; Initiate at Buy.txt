Travel bans in view of the outbreak of Delta Variant in Guangzhou and Nanjing
is likely to weigh on 3Q domestic travel momentum That said when the
pandemic gradually dies down and when vaccination surpasses 21bn times we
see scope for domestic travel to normalize into 4Q particularly when the quarter
is clustered with various festivals and shopping campaigns that catalyze leisure
travelling and shopping CTGDF is the largest domestic duty-free operator with
90% market share in 2020 and is therefore poised to be the major beneficiary
of this recovery trajectory The stock is trading at 309x end-22E PE at par to its
3-year average but -2sd below its 1-year average when the stock was re-rated
on policy tailwind We argue shares mean-reversion is likely to take place towards
4Q not to mention value to be unlocked through its secondary H share listing on
an expanded shareholder base We initiate the stock at Buy with TP of RMB3500
 Hainan expansion a major driver to offer 510% CAGR to duty-free
revenue We project a 423% 3-year revenue CAGR for CTGDF during 2020-
23E We forecast duty-free sales to grow at a 510% CAGR during the same
period which will be underpinned by its organic expansion in Haitang Bay
Phase 2 and Haikou International Duty-free Mall The expansion is
debottlenecking to CTGDF in our view as a larger store space will enable
CTGDF to enrich its product shelving and display across its brand portfolio
 Potential earnings upside on rental renegotiation and tax concession
We believe rental renegotiation for Beijing airport could enhance operating
leverage while Hainans potential tax concession approval could boost
202122E net profits by approximately 8% in our estimate Separately owing
to a rising online lower-margins SKU mix we expect pressure to gross
margins to prevail until 2022E when a more centralized procurement strategy
recovering offline traffic and the SKU mix upgrade could revive the trend
 Valuation at its low-cycle 309x PE we are c5% ahead of 22E consensus
Our target price of RMB3500 is based on 430x end-22E PE which
represents 1sd above the average of the last 3 years Our multiple is also
benchmarked to the average valuation of 440x since July 2020 This explains
our near-term expectation for CTGDFs share price to mean-revert as if
domestic travel and spending were to recover as we are heading to a more
festive 4Q Our 2021E earnings is slightly below consensus while that of
2022E is c6% above

An unchallenged leadership despite relaxed entry regulation
Although there have been new entrants to Chinas travel retail market in the recent years
we hold the view that CTGDF will be able to leverage its first-mover advantage as well as
its edges in rapid store expansion a rich product portfolio and a well-tailored customer
loyalty program to secure its market share
Industry and operation experience makes high entry barrier to new entrants
Duty-free market in China is highly concentrated and has a high entry barrier In 2020
according to Frost and Sullivan the top five duty-free travel retailers in China accounted
for 999% of the market share with CTGDF being the no1 player with a market share of
Figure 10 Top 5 duty-free merchandise operators ranking (by retail sales) China 2020

CTGDF was among 10 groups of entities with duty-free operation permits in China and
among six groups of entities with duty-free operation permits to operate duty-free port
stores nationwide Meanwhile the Company is currently the only group with operation
permits for all types of duty-free stores in China In particular the Company enjoys
offshore duty-free market share in 2020 according to Frost  Sullivan Although the
restrictions to enter into the duty-free market has been relaxed in recent years we believe
new entrants will not be able to shake up the market dynamics in the near term as they
would struggle with various operation challenges given the lack of industry experience as
well as supply management

We await relaxation on purchase of imported necessities for Hainan residents
The next supportive policy announcement according to the Chinese government in
December 2020 relates to allowing duty-free shopping for Hainan onshore residents
(without departing Hainan) which we believe could be a pilot program ahead of the tax
exemption initiative for Hainan by 2025 According to Wind there are about 9mn local
residents in Hainan Assuming an annual luxury leisure spending of RMB1000 that
CTGDF could capture we estimate the relaxation should it realize would represent a
RMB9bn addressable market that CTGDF could explore and a 14% expansion to the
Hainan offshore duty free market
Domestic consumption repatriation
The 14th Five-Year Plan promotes a new development pattern that centers on the domestic
consumption circulation along with the co-development of an international circulation The
policy emphasizes the central role of the domestic consumption and seeks to improve the
efficacy and efficiency of the circulation with the aim of bringing back overseas spending
to sustain domestic economic growth According to CTGDF total overseas duty-free
spending by China tourists reached approximately RMB18tn in 2019 with Korean Duty-
domestic duty free spending Assuming 10% of the spending will be redirected to the
domestic market we estimate this could boost the market size of the latter by 33%

On a separate note The Tax Free World Association (TFWA) pointed out that around 78%
of China consumers spending were conducted overseas The organization also pointed
out that Chinese consumers contributed about 60% of the global duty-free consumption in
2020 and about 80% of the Korea duty-free consumption of the same year

goods grew 82% YoY to RMB16tn according to the China Custom Jewelry and
cosmetics offered the fastest growth of 30% followed by suitcase of 20% This translated
to RMB33bn duty-free spending for Hainan for the same year despite travel restrictions
amid the pandemic Given the ambition of reshaping Hainan to be a tax-free port by 2025
domestic duty-free sales will remain a channel to repatriate overseas consumption back to

of online shopping and creates a consistent customer engagement from the moment a trip
is planned and the moment the traveler returns home The international travel restrictions

interaction between customers and KOLs

Unlocking value from a USD1bn H-share secondary listing
shareholders Operationally the listing will help cementing CTGDFs global presence by
enhancing its war chest for future overseas expansion or acquisitions as well as smoothing
out its international procurement activities The former will include green-field projects in
port stores overseas securing concession rights and operate duty-free stores in airports in
Asia as well as duty-free counters on cruise ships of which is regarded as the new growth
spot for Chinese tourists Separately according to CTGDF there will be a portion of the
proceeds to be spent on existing channels including but not limited to
Investment in the duty-free stores in key airports seaports railway stations etc More
specifically the proceeds will be used to (a) develop new stores in key airports
especially in relation to their renovation procurement and operations and (b) renew
the concession rights
a business model with duty-free retail as their core business and in synergetic
development with other businesses such as duty-paid retail dining entertainment

CTGDFs leadership in Hainan (currently 90% market share) especially when we forecast
Hainans total duty-free sales could grow at a 462% 5-year CAGR from currently RMB60bn
by end-2021 to RMB183bn by 2025 Our forecast is in line with Hainans official target of
RMB60bn in 2021 and RMB100bn in 2022 and is slightly more aggressive than IATAs
recovery expectation of having global tourist traffic for 2022 and 2023 to reach 88% and
105% of 2019 respectively

Potential re-rating from an expanded shareholder base
We argue the benefits from CTGDFs secondary listing in HK do not only source from an
enhanced operational efficiency but also from an expanded global investor base CTGDF
will be the only stock in the H-share market that directly exposes to the fast-growing duty-
free market of China It possess a recognizable operational scale and an unparalleled
industry leadership a crown jewel of the market that deserves a scarcity premium over
both its international and domestic peers in a sustainable manner
Since July 2020 CTGDF used to trade at a 20x average premium to its international peers
such as Hotel Shilla (008770 KS NR) Lotte Shopping (023530 KS NR) Lagardere (MMB
FP NR) and Dufry (DUFN SW NR) Given a higher ROE and faster earnings projection
(34% 2-year CAGR vs c20% CAGR) CTGDF looks to be undervalued relative to its peers

We project a 423% 3-year revenue CAGR for CTGDF during 2020-23E driven mainly by
a 510% CAGR of duty-free sales which will be underpinned by the fast-growing Hainan
offshore duty-free business Owing to the rapid expansion of the online operations which
typically offer lower profitability as well as more aggressive discount promotions amid the
pandemic we estimate gross margins weakness to prevail until 2022E when benefits of a
better SKU mix and scale of economies emerge Meanwhile a lower rental and hence
better operating leverage could partially neutralize the impact to our net profits estimates
We regard further rental concessions from Beijing and Guangzhou airports and Hainans
tax concession as event-driven catalyst to our earnings forecasts
Hainan offshore and online businesses are major revenue growth drivers
We expect total revenue growth to offer a 423% 3-year CAGR from 2020-2023E
mainly driven by the 510% CAGR of duty-free sales Owing to the resurgence of
COVID cases in May 2Q21 revenue were flat QoQ Together with the lingering
outbreaks in Nanjing by end-July we believe market expectation on 3Q revenue has
remained low That said this could probably mark the trough of the year followed by
a quick recovery heading into the festive 4Q in our view Into 2022E we are hopeful
to see a pick-up in duty-free revenue from a better tourist traffic to Hainan Separately
there is no sign of a slowdown in CTGDFs online business thanks to an aggressive
online strategy not to mention the gradual yet permanent migration in the shopping
behaviour for Chinese consumers For instance we estimate CTGDFs Sanya DF and
Hainan Duty-free (HDFS) to register RMB394bn145bn and RMB493bn195bn
revenue for 202122E respectively (1H21 RMB185bn and RMB77bn)

Margins recovery in sight thanks to better efficiency and SKU mix
Profit margins across business segments (ie ports airports and offshore operations
etc) vary due to product mix and mark-up Of note cosmetic and beauty products
typically offer higher margins than luxuries and apparels The same dynamic also
Since 2020 a higher contribution from electronic platforms (website WeChat) and
discount offered to members were the major reasons for gross margins to soften That
said we are optimistic that over time scale of economies from a centralized
procurement would gradually mitigate the trend Separately CTGDF also mentioned
since the policy relaxation in July 2020 they have seen a noticeable pickup in demand
for high price-tag products There is also an increasing number of brand owners who
be positive to CTGDF We only expect a more meaningful pick-up beyond 2022E
when travel restrictions are more likely to be withdrawn
Figure 35 Gross margins profile 2017-23E

Rental revision a relief to margins provision reversal an upside to earnings
The revision on the rental negotiations with Shanghai Pudong airport was favorable to
CTGDF Instead of charging a monthly rental guarantee the new term is based on
variable factors such as international and total passenger volume as well as rental
area if international traffic falls below 80% of the average monthly level of 2019
Separately the monthly rental guarantee would only be required only when
international passenger traffic rises beyond 80% of the average monthly level of 2019
On the financial statements the new agreement has achieved a 70% rental fee

CTGDF has not finalized its discussions with Beijing and Guangzhou Airport But since
rental terms of both were based on passenger traffic of the airports we incline to believe
CTGDF would also be able to enjoy similar concessions when the number of international
travelers remains unexciting We estimate CTGDF had already provided for the rental
expenses for Beijing and Guangzhou airports for 2020 and 1H21 In this case any future
rental concessions should prompt relevant reversals and hence profit accretive
Hainans 15% tax concession could boost 8% of 202122E consolidated NPs
CTGDF recognized a 25% effective tax rate for 2018-20 as the Company is yet to be
entitled to the 15% tax concession under Hainans Free Trade Port (FTP) scheme We
have no visibility on when CTGDF could monetize the opportunity however we are certain
that the recognition could not only lead to a partial reversal of a RMB257bn tax provision
for 2020 but also 13% increase in post-tax profits for CTGDFs Hainan operations upon
implementation In our sensitivity analysis the change could lead to c8% upside in our
202122E net profits estimate on group level

Changes in the existing duty-free policies and regulations  CTGDFs duty-free retail
business in China is generally subject to the government policies and regulations and any
changes in these policies or regulations would significantly impact the duty-free purchase
volume and thus materially impact CTGDF In particular the downtown duty-free policies
will likely be further refined and the further development of downtown duty-free stores
Renewed outbreak of domestic COVID variants  that directly attributable to further
travel bans and hence visitation to Hainan
Competition from online shopping platforms  online retailers for instance the Daigou
service provider are able to sell directly to consumers diminishing the importance of
traditional distribution channels Internet retailers may have significantly lower operating
costs than CTGDF does as they do not rely on an expensive physical retail network or a
Risk with brand owners  renewal of contracts with brands is subject to the mutual
consent and CTGDF may lose the cooperation due to various reason such as brand owners
ongoing struggle on balancing the interest between onshore and duty-free sales
Resumption of global travelling activities  this may indirectly channel domestic duty-
free spending to overseas
