Willsemi released 1H21 results last night with revenueNP growth of 55%127%
YoY in line with previous announcement 1H21 revenueNP accounted for
43%46% and 45%48% of ourconsensus FY21E estimates The GPM improved
to 337% from 299% in FY20 due to favorable product mix Looking forward we
are positive on the Companys expansion driven by high growth in non-
mobile CIS segments and GPM improvement We reiterate BUY rating on
Willsemi an established player with diversified product portfolio with unchanged
TP of RMB 37075
 Solid growth in mobile CIS and greater-than-expected contribution from
non-mobile CIS Although there are mixed views on smartphone camera
spec we believe mobile CIS will continue to deliver solid results on
smartphone updates Meanwhile the Companys mgmt emphasizes greater
potentials beyond mobile market which has stronger demand and higher
GPM We believe earnings contribution from non-mobile CIS will surpass
mobile CIS in FY22E thanks to rapid growth in automobile security ARVR
and medical
 Recent price increase from foundries due to semi shortage has limited
impact on the Company First Willsemis capacity is well protected by the
agreement with the foundries Its two main wafer suppliers SMIC and HLMC
will expand its capacity by next year which will support production for the
Company Second we believe semi shortage is a global event that affects all
players Backed by strong demand we think the Company is able to transfer
the cost pressure to clients and deliver higher GPM
 Reiterate BUY rating with unchanged TP of RMB37075 We derive our TP
of RMB37075 by applying 50x FY22E PE We believe this valuation is
justified given 1) its leading position in CIS market with global presence and
2) its integrated semiconductor platform with diversified product portfolio We
view recent correction as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain
exposure to quality Chinese semi fabless names that can ride strategic trends
Willsemi is currently trading 1-sd below historical PE which is very attractive
worse-than-expected semi shortage and 4) new disruptive technology
