BUY (Maintain)
(Previous TP            RMB 3048)
UpDownside
Shengyi Tech reported 1H21 results with revenue of RMB98bn (43% YoY) and
net profit of RMB14bn (71% YoY)largely in-line with its preannounced earnings
earlier We believe Shengyis solid results confirmed the upcycle for CCL
segment Although PCB business remains under pressure due to rising raw
material costs which partially offset the growth from CCL we remain positive on
Shengyi Techs outlook We revised up FY21-23E EPS by 3-12% and raised TP
to RMB3190 Maintain BUY
 Strong 2Q21 results driven by CCL upcycle PCB business remains
weak By segment CCLpregreg revenuenet profit grew 62%171% YoY
and PCB grew revenuenet profit declined 25%66% YoY CCLpregreg GPM
is flattish QoQ at 293% in 2Q21 (vs 293%264% for 1Q212Q20) while
PCB GPM continued to decline to 160% (vs 216%285% for 1Q212Q20)
As global No2 CCL supplier we believe Shengyi Tech was able to transfer
the material cost pressure to downstream PCB manufacturers However
blended GPM decreased to 257% in 2Q21 (vs 279% in 1Q21) given 1)
deteriorated margin from PCB business and 2) limited margin upside from
CCL business as rising costs may curb downstream demand
 Expect another strong quarter in 3Q and stable 4Q may have higher
uncertainty Looking forward we think the Company will deliver a strong
3Q21 given peak season and high order visibility We believe 1) auto market
will continue its momentum and remain as the key driver for CCL and 2)
resumed with stable GPM and ASP Overall we think 2H revenue growth will
be similar to 1H given 1) limited room for CCL suppliers to increase ASP and
2) increasing demand uncertainty from downstream clients in 4Q due to high
cost pressure
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB3190 We slightly adjusted our TP to
RMB3190 based on higher earnings forecasts and lower 250x FY22PE (vs
previous 30x due to limited CCL ASP upside and demand uncertainty)
Trading at 232x207x FY2122E PE the stock remains attractive Potential
risks include less-than-expected transfer of material costs and less-than-
expected market demand

Maintain BUY with new TP at RMB3190 (21% upside)
We maintain BUY rating with slightly adjusted TP of RMB3190 based on lower 25x FY22E
PE We believe the valuation is justified given that there is limited room for CCL ASP to
increase and potential uncertainty in downstream demand due to material cost pressure
Trading at 232x207x FY2122E PE the stock remains attractive Potential risks include
less-than-expected transfer of material costs and less-than-expected market demand
