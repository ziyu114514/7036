Despite the fact that industry demand for excavator was weak and steel cost was
high in 2Q21 Henglis net profit in 2Q21 only dropped 2% YoY to RMB626mn
which is slightly better than expectation Net profit in 1H21 grew 43% YoY to
RMB141bn which accounted for 48% of our full year estimates (run rate in 1H20
43%) Its worth noting that the revenue from pump valve and other products
exceeded that of the excavator hydraulic cylinder in 1H21 a key driver for the
resilient results We expect Henglis production volume of hydraulic cylinders in
Aug to see 10% YoY growth and expect an acceleration in 4Q21E on the back
of better infrastructure spending growth That said we maintain our HOLD rating
as we believe the stock is fairly-priced at 43x 2021E PE We maintain our TP of
RMB103 (based on unchanged 46x 2021E PE)
 Key financials in 1H21 Revenue in 1H21 grew 51% YoY to RMB52bn
Gross margin held up well at 41% (down only 09ppt YoY) Operating cash
inflow grew 25% YoY to RMB119bn which is healthy in our view In 2Q21
Hengli managed to deliver 14% YoY revenue growth while gross margin
remained stable at 41% QoQ despite the high steel cost
 Hydraulic cylinder better than our expectation Sales volume of hydraulic
cylinder (for excavator) grew 44% YoY to 474k units in 1H21 The sales
volume growth outpaced the excavator industry sales volume growth of 38%
ASP slightly dropped 4% YoY to RMB4177  unit Sales volume of non-
standardized cylinders grew 23% YoY to 788k units in 1H21 and ASP
increased 19% YoY to RMB107kunit due to product mix improvement in our
 Explosive growth of pump valve and motor continued Revenue from
Hengli Hydraulic Technology (major products include pump valve and motor)
surged 78% YoY to RMB21bn in 1H21 which exceeded the revenue from
excavator hydraulic cylinder (RMB198bn)
 Upside risks (1) Strong market share gain (2) better-than-expected
risks (1)
construction activities (2) risk of overseas expansion
