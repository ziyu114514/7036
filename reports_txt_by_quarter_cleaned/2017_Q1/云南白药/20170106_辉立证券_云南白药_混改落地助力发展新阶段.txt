雲南白藥 (000538CH)
6 January 2017
雲南白藥原本生產並銷售具有止血功能的抗感染中藥白藥，白藥配方為國家
級保密配方，無直接競爭者，定價能力強。近年來，公司積極實施以藥為本的
新白藥、大健康的發展戰略，重點發展四大業務板塊：藥品板塊以雲南白藥中央
透皮產品為成熟現金牛品種，普藥則以氣血康口服液、血塞通膠囊的一系列新品推動
穩健增長；健康產品板塊在確保白藥牙膏較快增長的情況下，重點推進養元青洗髮護
髮系列、清逸堂衛生巾系列；中藥資源板塊則利用雲南道地天然植物藥材的資源優勢
構建原材料資源全產業鏈；此外，公司醫藥商業板塊亦不斷通過管道的持續完善為公

值得一提的是，在推動新戰略過程中，公司品牌延展能力凸顯，雲南白藥牙膏已
成為市場份額前三的知名品牌，且是市場份額前五中唯一國產品牌。藉此，公司成為
過去十多年醫藥股中的長跑冠軍。
根據公告，新華都擬向公司控股股東白藥控股增資約人民幣254 億元。交易完成
後，白藥控股的股權結構將由雲南省國資委持有100%股權變更為雲南省國資委和新華
都各持有50%股權，同時，白藥控股仍持有公司4152%的股份，本次事項亦觸發上市
公司層面的要約收購。
混改完成後，集團控股將由國有獨資變為國有民營混合，並且民營擁有足夠股東
表決話語權，這將令雲南白藥的管理模式趨於靈活和市場化（未來白藥控股的董事、
監事及高級管理人員均以市場化原則進行選聘），並為上市公司未來推進股權激勵奠
定基礎，同時，公司的外延並購亦有望提速，新業務拓展或步入新臺階，未來有望在
精准醫療、養老養生、醫療服務等大健康領域加快佈局，推動公司進入發展新階段。

還值一提的是，此次混改觸發了雲南白藥的全面要約收購，且未來不以終
止雲南白藥的上市地位為目的。考慮到收購價格高達6498 元，僅較停牌前低
61%，將為股價提供較強支撐。
雲南白藥系內地中藥領軍企業，近幾年佈局大健康亦實現明顯成效，而本
次控股股東混改推進速度快、審批效率高均為行業少有，有望成為行業標杆性
事件。考慮公司原主業穩健發展及深厚的品牌資源價值，集團混改又將帶來新
一輪發展機遇，給予其對應2017 年每股收益275 倍估值，目標價為906 元，
首予買入評級。(現價截至1 月4 日)
