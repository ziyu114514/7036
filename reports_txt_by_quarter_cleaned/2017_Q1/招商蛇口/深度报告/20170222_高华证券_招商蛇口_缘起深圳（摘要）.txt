招商蛇口 (001979SZ，买入)
作为中国新经济的创新中心，深圳积极的宏观前景和人口趋势令我们对本地房地产市场的长期前景信心十足。招商蛇口是招商局
旗下房地产业务的旗舰公司，致力于社区园区邮轮母港三大业务的开发运营，我们认为，较之其它大型开发商以及我们所研究
同业，招商蛇口因其最高的深圳资产占比（深圳在其土地储备2017 年底预期净资产价值中的占比分别为45%70%）而拥有实
现资产价值长期升值的最佳定位。由于公司在深圳的优质土地储备成本低且开发周期长，而且与招商局集团跨行业资源的潜在
资产整合有望带来增值空间，我们认为招商蛇口有望实现持续强于同业的盈利增长，并带来稳健的股东回报。
市场过度担忧短期风险，长期增值空间犹存
1市场过度计入了深圳市场的周期性风险：在过去12 个月中招商蛇口股价较
内地上市开发商领先了14%，但年初至今止步不前，因为市场对于深圳楼市或
因史上最严调控令而走软的前景倍感担忧。目前招商蛇口的净资产价值折让
在我们所覆盖国内上市开发商中处于最大幅度（40% vs 同业30%），我们认
为市场过度计入了深圳楼市或因政策而走软的担忧情绪。
2 近期经营层面积极向好：在倍受瞩目且开发周期较长的前海项目的权益分配
太子湾项目的合作开发等方案上有了实质性进展；股权激励计划得以执行；
3与母公司招商局存在更大规模的长期协同效应，有望通过城市更新改造、国
企资产整合以及邮轮母港开发等多种方式获取土地、继而开发多元化地产资产
组合，显著扩张盈利增长空间。
深圳楼市在数次周期轮转中的表现一直领先于全国整体市场，而且在前一上行
周期中实现了最大的价格涨幅。因此，我们认为，虽然深圳楼市或将提早出现
较大幅度回调的不利因素可能给招商蛇口股价的市场情绪带来冲击，但我们认
为这将只是短期现象。
撇除周期性波动，我们看好深圳房地产市场，并对房地产各个子行业的长期前
景持乐观看法，尽管不同细分领域依旧处在各自供应周期的不同阶段。我们预
计到2025 年深圳房地产市场的总资产价值将翻番至37 万亿美元，从而令扎根
深圳的招商蛇口成为一个主要受益者，并在执行得当的情况下拥有显著的市值
扩张潜力。考虑到招商蛇口土地储备的重估价值，以及基于深圳楼市量价变化
的净资产价值情景分析，我们认为招商蛇口当前的大幅净资产价值折让并不合

Best-in-class land bank in SZ to drive fully-funded returns
Leveraging its best-in-class land bank position in SZ and its shared resources and
branding with China Merchants Group (CMG) we believe CMSK is poised to lead the long-
industrial park and cruise homeport development each accounting for on average

2016E with SZ contributing over 30%-40% of 2017E-2019E presales 45% of land bank

High PB is not the full story asset value overly discounted
We apply a 30% target price discount to end-2017E NAV of Rmb281 to derive our 12-month
target price of Rmb200 for CMSK vs the range of 10% to 50% discount for the onshore
coverage (or on average 30%) Our target price for CMSK implies a higher premium of 30% to
our onshore sector TP-implied PB  ROE trendline vs 20% premium its predecessor China
Merchants Property (CMP (A) 000024SZ delisted) traded at during the last downturn in 2H13-
2014 to reflect CMSKs improving ROE and lower than peers average leverage ratios (see Exhibit
24 in Appendix)
Post the merger with CMP in December 2015 we note that CMSK has been trading at higher PB
multiples than its predecessor CMP and an enlarged premium to onshore peers which in our
view are mainly attributable to (1) its almost doubled land bank size through the asset
integration with significantly boosted exposure to SZ (45% of land bank vs 17% for
CMP) but the book value has yet to fully factor in its future profit potential (2) meanwhile
the SZ assets (mainly Shekou Prince Bay and Qianhai projects) were injected at
below market price therefore CMSKs book value at cost has not fully reflected its intrinsic
land bank value We estimate that CMSKs total land bank value if marked to market
will be about Rmb401bn almost double its original cost
As Exhibit 10 shows despite trading at a premium to its book value CMSKs current share price
of Rmb1671 (Feb 17 closing) is at a deep discount to its reappraised land bank value and
end-2017 GHe NAV (40% discount vs onshore average of 30%) suggesting that property
prices in prime locations are likely to fall more than those in average locations which is unjustified
and we believe the risk-reward is skewed to the upside

been trading at higher PB multiples than peers

Strong balance sheet to fuel scale expansion
Despite active land banking last year (land acquisition amounted to 114% of its presales or 72% if
excluding the Shenzhen New Exhibition Center project jointly bided with OCT (000069SZ) vs
coverage developers average of 56% in 2016) CMSK still preserves a healthy balance sheet
due to its existing balance sheet strength (one of the sectors lowest net gearing ratios at end-
2015) and strong sales performance last year (28% yoy and beat management target by 14%)
Together with its access to cheaper capital (as the sole real estate arm of a top SOE ie
CMG) and scope for value creation from potential asset integration with CMGs cross-industry
resources CMSK stands out among peers to grow its asset portfolio through diversified land
sourcing channels and is thus more likely to achieve solid growth in the midst of a sector

SZ market volatilities (S-T) execution in QianhaiPrince Bay (improving)
CMSK has outperformed onshore peers by 14% over the past 12 months but its share price has
plateaued recently Based on our discussion with investors their concerns are concentrated in
two main areas
1 Concentration risk in Shenzhen where stringent-than-ever tightening polices are in
place (including strict presales permits and price control announced recently) and CMSK will be
more vulnerable to any potential SZ property market volatilities We note that during the past two
industry downcycles property prices corrected by 26%12% from the peak to low (Aug-2007 to
Feb-2009 and May-2011 to Feb-2012 respectively) in Shenzhens secondary market while
downturns We lay out below our sensitivity analysis by assuming ASPvolume would be
30%50% below our base-case assumptions to test the potential downside risks to our earnings
and valuation estimates for CMSK (as Exhibits 15-16 show earnings will be on average 20%
lower for 2017E2018E and 2017E NAV will shrink 15% in the bear case)
Trading at a deepest discount to NAV for CMSK among our onshore coverage we think the
market has priced in an overly bearish view on the SZ property market outlook from a policy
driven downturn and implies that property prices in prime locations are likely to fall more than
those in average locations which is unjustified as we do see more resilient ASP
performances in the Nanshan district (where 83%38% of CMSKs SZ land banktotal land
bank size is located) on the back of supply shortage and more promising economic growth
Nanshan is the high tech industrial base higher education center and logistics hub of
Shenzhen and has the highest GDP as a single district in the Guangdong province As
shown in Exhibits 17-18 Nanshan is the most active market within four core districts (namely
Futian Luohu Nanshan Yantian) in SZ and its ASP performance has been more resilient
during industry downcycles
Looking forward we believe the positive macro outlook coupled with world-class
infrastructure will bolster a buoyant SZ local property market and support capital
value appreciation over time If ASPs were to increase 30% from 2016 levels3 and
volumes were to rise 20% (back to the peak in 2009) our end-2017E NAV and average
2017E-2018E earnings for CMSK would be boosted by 20%25% As such we
believe CMSKs valuation riskreward is skewed towards the upside

2 Execution slippage for QianhaiPrince Bay sites development (accounting for 35% of
its end-2017E NAV and average 20% of its 2017E-2019E presales) Given (1) the final
consideration and detailed development plan is still under negotiation with the Qianhai local
government and (2) both are high profile and decade-long development projects for CMSK any
potential slower-than-expected progression of the land site conversion andor development may
adversely impact CMSKs earnings visibility in the next few years
We have seen steady and meaningful progress in terms of CMSKs development of the
QianhaiPrince Bay sites during the past few months

Authority of Qianhai on October 26 2016 (on a 40%60% basis) following their

Prince Bay site CMSK disposed two land plots to New World Development (0017HK)
on December 8 2016 (the implied land price is cRmb24ksqm vs CMSKs original land
projects in the Prince Bay site We think by cooperating with an experienced
investment property operator CMSK will not only unlock its asset value but also
expedite the development pace and further improve the project quality
Moreover the share option incentive scheme (including 49mn shares 062% of total
execution price of Rmb1951 17% higher than the current share price (as of 17 Feb) and
covering 254 core members 13% of total) announced in December 2016 shows
managements confidence in the promising growth trajectory for CMSK in the longer run
Under the plan it has strict prerequisite exercising conditions on ROE (ROE excl
extraordinary gainloss to be no less than 13%14%15% before the three exercising periods)
net profit (3-year CAGR to be no less than 13%) and stock price (to be above IPO price
Rmb2334 for at least 10 trading days) We believe the strategic move could help better align
the interests of its key employees (especially mid-level management and executive-level
On Jan 17 2017 CMSK reported an upbeat profit alert for FY2016 with net profit up 92%-
102% yoy (or up 35%-42% vs 2015 pro forma net profit) to Rmb93 bn-Rmb98 bn or EPS of
Rmb118-Rmb124 Apart from the impact of the minorities interest arrangement in 2015-
2016 post restructuring its earnings growth were mainly driven by 1) 33% yoy rise in
property sales booked and 2) en-bloc sales of Nanhai E-cool and Qianhai Bay Garden in
Shenzhen which monetized the land bank value
Major risks include 1) Sales and margin miss on significant unexpected SZ market
correction We estimate our 2017E2018E underlying profit will be affected by -11%-29% if its
SZ ASPvolume were to drop 30%50% from 2016 levels (similar percentage drop from peak to
trough in SZ during past downcycles) and 2) supply outpacing demand exerting pressure
on the rental outlook in SZ especially unsuccessful development of the SZ Free Trade
(vs flattish rental growth in our base-case) and 1pp expansion of cap rate (vs our base-case
75%) will affect CMSKs valuation by 12%
Long-term conviction in SZ further asset integration with CMG
Other than the impact from Chinas housing cycles which drives developers stocks in a broader
way we find that the relative outperformanceunderperformance of CMSK (or CMP before 2016)
against peers is more significantly affected by the SZ local property market and scope for value
creation from potential asset integration with CMG
1) Shenzhen the weather vane
We expect headwinds from strictest ever tightening policies in SZ to remain until we see more
meaningful price weakness Any surprising market correction could nonetheless impact sentiment
on CMSK but should be short-lived as we see the downturn in this cycle as more policy driven
Looking beyond short-term fluctuations we prefer SZs housing market and remain bullish across
all real estate sectors in the long term We forecast the total capital value of SZs real
estate market would double by 2025E and thus developers with a strong presence there
2) Cultivating greater synergies with parent group
We see further room for CMSK to explore a diversified portfolio of property assets within CMGs
cross-industry resources and believe potential synergies have yet to be priced in During recent
years CMG has been consolidating various business segments under its corporate umbrella
both internally and externally We believe this presents ample opportunities for CMSK as it can
now grow its asset portfolio through diversified land sourcing channels such as land
injection and conversion through SOEs property asset consolidation and cruise town
developments based on key port assets owned by CMG thus serving as a line-up of
potential catalysts
