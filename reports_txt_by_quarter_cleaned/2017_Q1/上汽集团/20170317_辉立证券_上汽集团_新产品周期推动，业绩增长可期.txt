上汽集團 (600104CH)
新產品週期推動，業績增長可期
中國  汽車製造  更新報告
17 March 2017
首兩月銷量整體基本持平，自主品牌保持強勁勢頭
上汽集團首兩月銷量基本持平，好於行業平均。總銷量按年增長 113%，至10513 萬
輛，自主品牌的強勁增長，及合資品牌的持平被上汽通用五菱的下滑抵消。具體車企
來看，合資品牌上汽大眾銷售332 萬輛，同比微減39%，上汽通用銷售288 萬輛，
同比增長465%，上汽乘用車銷售73 萬輛，同比勁升1004%，上汽通用五菱銷售
334 萬輛，同比減少76%。我們認為，購置稅補貼減半對於主要銷售16L 以下排量的
上汽通用五菱影響較大，是其銷量疲弱的重要原因。具體車型來看，高端車型如全新
朗逸，polo，途觀，GL8，昂科威，凱迪拉克，RX5 等銷售勢頭強勁，車型結構進一步

因融合了阿裏巴巴研發的互聯網車載操作系統體系，新SUV 車型榮威RX5 甫一
推出即受熱捧，上市後7 個月累計銷量達到11 萬輛，月銷最高至25 萬輛。近
期公司進一步推出了基於互聯網架構打造的轎車車型榮威i6，定價在898
1368 萬元區間，繼續完善該系列車型覆蓋。我們認為，隨著產能逐漸匹配，上
汽自主品牌今年有較大可能在銷售規模上實現突破，同比增幅有望超過四成。
合資車企中，上汽大眾今年上半年有數款SUV 車型上市，包括熱銷車型途觀L，
大型SUV 途昂，斯柯達旗下的科迪亞克；上汽通用將新推出中型SUV 雪佛蘭探
界者，MPV GL6，凱迪拉克XT5 等全新車型；上汽通用五菱也將繼續推新的SUV
車型B510 來提振銷量。
上汽集團於年初公告完成員工持股為主要目標的定向增發，募資150 億元人民
幣，發行對象包括上汽總公司，2207 名中高級管理人員，以及中原、平安等投
資公司，主要投向新能源、智能化、車聯網和汽車金融等新興領域。母公司和
員工的持股鎖定期長達三年，有利於建立和完善公司與員工的利益共享機制，
提升運營效率。發行價228 元股，相對當前價格僅折讓一成，具備較大安全邊
我們認為，在新的產品週期推動下，公司實現超預期的業績增長值得期待。同
時手握充沛現金流，將令公司較高的現金分紅率(50%)有望持續。我們小幅調整
公司目標價至2718 人民幣元，對應2017 年86 倍預計市盈率，評級增
