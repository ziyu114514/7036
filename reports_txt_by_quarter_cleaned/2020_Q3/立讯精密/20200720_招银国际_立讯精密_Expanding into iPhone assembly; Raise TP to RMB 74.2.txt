Luxshare announced on 17 July that Luxshare and its parentco will acquire 100%
of Wistrons two subsidiaries in Kunshan for a deal value of RMB33bn Luxshare
will invest no more than RMB600mn (72% of 1Q20 cash) for 18% stake of the
assets We think it will allow Luxshare to expand into iPhone assembly business
as No3 supplier (7-10% of share) behind Foxconn and Pegatron and it is positive
(acousticshapticswirelessLCP) and earnings upside after turning Wistrons
OEM biz into profitability We lifted FY20-22E EPS by 1-11 % to reflect better
AirPodsWatch sales but does not factor in financial impact of this transaction
Reiterate BUY and lifted TP to RMB 742 based on rollover 42x FY21E PE
Long-term synergy with Apple ecosystem Limited financial impact in
in-class vertically-integrated Apple supplier covering both assembly and
partnership with Apple we think Luxshare will continue to gain share on
and LCP modules Given that Wistrons iPhone OEM remains loss-making
and no consolidation is required for Luxshares 18% stake we expect limited
financial impact in FY20-21E and we have not included in our forecasts yet
Implications to iPhone OEM supply chain We estimate Wistron currently
accounted for 7-10% share allocation of total iPhone shipment lagging
behind FoxconnPegatron (60%30% share) After deal is closed by end-
FY20 we expect Wistron will focus on iPhone OEM in its India plant while
Luxshare will start to expand share in iPhone OEM in China backed by its
vertically-integrated supply chain and strong execution capability
Raise FY20-22E EPS by 1-11 % for better AirPodsWatch In view of
stronger AirPodsWatch demand and more positive iPhone outlook we lifted
FY20-22E EPS by 1-11% as we estimate Luxshares AirPods shipment to
reach 69mn85mn and Watch sales to reach RMB 6bn9bn in FY2021E
 Beneficiary of Apple supplier diversification Raise TP to RMB 742 Our
new TP of RMB 742 is based on rollover 42x FY21E PE given strong
earnings CAGR and promising growth profile in iPhoneAirPodsWatch

Reiterate BUY and rasied TP to RMB 742 (35% upside)
We derived our 12m TP of RMB 742 based on rollover 42x FY21E PE We believe this is
justified as Luxshare continues to deliver strong earnings growth market share gain and
product expansion to capture 5G and wireless opportunities in next 3-5 years
China 5G subs ramp Major risks include weaker AirPods demand weaker yield
improvement and slower integration of acquired businesses
