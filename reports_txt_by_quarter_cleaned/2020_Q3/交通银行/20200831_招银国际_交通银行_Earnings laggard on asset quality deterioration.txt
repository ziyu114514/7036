BoComs net profit declined 306%146% YoY in 2Q1H20 despite a solid
revenue growth of 66%52% YoY Notable earnings contraction was mainly due
to mounting provisions (992% YoY in 2Q20) against deteriorating asset quality
The Bank is following policy guidance to pile up risk reserves and conceded total
RMB14bn profit to the real economy during anti-COVID-19 campaign in 1H20
Although NPL formation may ease in 2H20 credit cost is likely to stay elevated
given lower-than-peers provision coverage further weighing on earnings growth
 Results positives 1) Loandeposit growth was healthy at 29%31% in
2Q20 Majority of new loans went to corporate side (99%) in 1H20 but
management said retail loan extension started to accelerate in 2Q20 and
should account for more than 40% of full-year loan growth 3) Non-interest
investment gains 3) Wealth management business capacity enhanced
with retail AUM 82% HoH no of OTO fortune customers 85% HoH and
private banking clients 133% HoH
 Results negatives 1) NIM narrowed 3bp QoQ5bp YoY to 152%153% in
2Q1H20 Due to LPR cuts asset yields shrank faster than liability cost in
1H20 In particular loan yield dropped 17bp HoH but deposit cost only slid
1bp HoH Management expected further margin pressure in 2H20 but will try
to stabilize NIM by replacing higher-cost structured depositsMLF with
cheaper interbank funding 2) Asset quality worsened NPL ratio edged up
9bp QoQ to 168% and provision coverage declined 55ppt QoQ to 1487%
This was partly due to more prudent NPL recognition as SML ratio retreated
38bp HoH The good news is that credit card NPLs peaked out in Jun and will
likely recovered to pre-pandemic level in 3Q20 Loans under deferred
repayment scheme amounted to RMB176bn 31% of total loans as of 2Q20
bank peers 4) Capital position weakened as CET1 ratio dropped 20bp QoQ
to 1063% on sluggish earnings and cash dividend payout
 Maintain HOLD and trim TP to RMB540 We cut our FY2021E earnings
assumptions Our revised RMB540 TP is based on 055x (from 062x) target
