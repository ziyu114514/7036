PABs 1H20 net profit declined 112% YoY to RMB137bn implying 355% YoY
shrink in 2Q20 earnings The bottom line weakness mainly came from surging
provisions (576% YoY) in 2Q20 as the Bank followed regulatory initiative to
build up loss reserves and hold back earnings expansion However its
revenuePPoP growth continued to outrun sector peers at 143%184% YoY
With notable pick-up in provision coverage and stringent NPL recognition PAB
should see greater room to lower credit cost and unleash earnings potential
when policy guidance effect wanes
 Results positives 1) Credit extension was solid at 24% QoQ Retail
loan growth recovered to 36% in 2Q20 from 1Q20 stagnation driven by
mortgage (60% QoQ) auto finance (110% QoQ) and personal business
342% YoY As a result revenue structure improved with 368% (21ppt
YoY to 277% indicating better operating efficiency 4) Asset quality
remained healthy NPL ratio was flat at 165% and provision coverage
climbed 15ppt QoQ to 215% higher than joint-stock banks average of 204%
Credit card NPL ratio edged up 3bp QoQ while corporate NPL ratio further
slid 5bp QoQ 5) Steady growth in retail client base Number of
retailwealthPB client rose 31%77%85% QoQ and retail AUM increased
86% QoQ to RMB232tn
 Results negatives 1) Deposits shrank 31% QoQ pushing LDR to 100%
Proportion of structured deposits stayed elevated at 224% 2) 2Q20 NIM
narrowed 1bp QoQ to 259% as asset yield contraction outweighed
funding cost retreat 3) Capital adequacy ratio dropped with 27bp31bp
QoQ decline in CET-1total CAR due to sluggish earnings and cash
dividend payout in 2Q20
 Maintain BUY and trim TP to RMB189 We cut FY2021 earnings forecast
by 12-14% as we lifted credit cost assumption by 20-24bp to reflect PABs
prudent provisioning against potential asset quality deterioration Our revised
TP of RMB189 is based on 124x (from 128x) target PB and FY20E BVPS
of RMB153
