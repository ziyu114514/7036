UpDownside
MSBs net profit declined 254%100% YoY in 2Q1H20 largely due to soaring
impairment charges of 609% YoY in 2Q20 Topline growth (revenue 99%
YoY PPoP 88% YoY) was still decent albeit a sequential moderation Same
as most nationwide bank peers MSB also accelerated NPL recognition and
boosted risk reserves during the industry downturn We like the banks robust
credit expansion and fast recovery of retail loans but relatively thin provision
buffer and below-average capital adequacy ratio are major overhangs
 Results positives 1) Healthy loan and deposit growth of 27%38%
QoQ It was encouraging to see a pick-up in retail loan growth of 52% in
2Q20 vs 18% in 1Q20 Mortgage and personal business loans were key
drivers and credit cards also saw a positive growth of 26% in 1H20 2) Net
interest-earnings assets and YoY margin widening 3) Effective tax rate
dropped 38ppt YoY given rising investments to tax-free government bonds
 Results negatives 1) 2Q20 NIM narrowed 3bp QoQ to 192% based on
our estimate This was due to 13bp HoH loan yield contraction and 5bp HoH
increase in deposit cost more than offsetting the 40bp drop of interbank
funding cost in 1H20 2) Asset quality under pressure NPL ratio surged
14bp QoQ to 169% and provision coverage slid 36ppt QoQ to 152% one
of the lowest in the sector However the bank tightened NPL recognition
standards as NPLs covered 125% of 90-day overdue loans as of 2Q20 up
4) Investment return declined 129% YoY on bond trading and exchange
losses 5) Capital position weakened CET1total CAR dropped 72bp38bp
QoQ to 824%1272% on sluggish earnings and cash dividend payout RWA
density rose 27ppt QoQ to 787%
 Maintain HOLD and lower TP to RMB640 We cut FY2021 earnings
assumptions Our revised TP of RMB640 is based on 058x (from 064x)
