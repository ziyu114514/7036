CITICB reported decent revenuePPoP growth of 103%152% YoY in 2Q20
However solid topline was slashed by heavy provision charges leading to YoY
earnings contraction of 265%98% in 2Q1H20 We see little surprise from the
negative profit growth given CBIRCs earlier announcement of 94%24%
banking sector earnings decline for the same period Policy guidance on profit
concession and overhang from the pandemic should continue to weigh on China
banks bottom line growth in 2H20 Having said that we see limited share price
downside at current depressed valuation Thorough NPL exposure and front-
loading of provisions bode well for long-term rerating
 Results positives 1) Heathy deposit growth of 39% QoQ outpaced loan
growth of 14% QoQ LDR fell 23ppt to 94% 2) 2Q20 NIM widened 4bp QoQ
to 201% mainly on rising yield of retail loans Yet 1H20 NIM still narrowed
12bp YoY amid decline in overall asset yields and rigid deposit cost
Management expected further margin contraction in 2H20 but likely in smaller
dropped 32ppt YoY to 231% suggesting better operating efficiency
 Results negatives 1) NPL ratio picked up 3bp QoQ18bp HoH to 183%
higher than joint-stock banks average of 163% This was mainly due to
worsening asset quality of retail loans esp credit cards of which NPL ratio
surged 76bp HoH to 250% However management saw credit card NPLs
abating from the peak in Mar 2020 2) Provision charges soared 665% YoY
in 2Q20 yet provision coverage slid 16ppt QoQ to 176% below peer average
of 204% 3) Capital position weakened on softer earnings and cash dividend
payout in 2Q20 CET1total CAR fell 12bp10bp QoQ to 880%1257%
 Maintain BUY with lower TP of RMB680 We cut FY2021 earnings
cost assumptions Our revised TP of RMB680 is based on 071x (from 075x)
target PB and FY20 BVPS of RMB962
