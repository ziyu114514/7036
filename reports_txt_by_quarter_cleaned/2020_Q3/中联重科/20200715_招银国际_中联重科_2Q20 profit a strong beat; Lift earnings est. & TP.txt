Zoomlion released a positive profit alert yesterday stating that net profit in 1H20E
will reach RMB38-42bn representing 47-63% YoY growth This is a surprise as
the earnings range implies 75-100% YoY growth in 2Q20E We raise our 2020E-
22E earnings forecast significantly by 24-42% (14-27% above consensus) and
lift our TP to RMB956 We see Zoomlion entering into a new growth trajectory
driven by the solid upcycle of concrete machinery and tower crane as well as the
aggressive expansion into attractive sub-segments such as excavator aerial
earnings revision by the market and strong machinery demand in 3Q Reiterate
 New assumptions The strong earnings growth in 1H20 was driven by strong
demand for concrete pump truck tower crane and construction crane as well
as the lower expense ratio thanks to the operating leverage and stringent cost
control We revise up our revenue and margin forecast in 2020E-22E Our
new forecast includes the potential dilution effect arising from the share
placement and the new capacity expansion plan released by the Company
last week
 Attractive valuation (98x 20E PE) suggests significant upside potential
We switch our valuation methodology from asset-based to earnings-based
approach in order to better capture the robust earnings growth outlook Our
new TP of RMB956 is based on 12x 2020E PE (previously RMB685 based
on 12x 2020E PB) In 2011 the year when Zoomlions earnings reach a
historical high of RMB83bn the stock traded at a valuation range of 10-12x
despite the high earnings base We benchmark our target multiple (12x) to
such valuation We believe our target is not aggressive given our EPS growth
estimate of 37%18% in 2020E21E
 Risk factors (1) Unexpected weakness on infrastructure spending (2) Slow
recovery of property construction (3) Risks of new business expansion

Share placement plan a positive
Last week Zoomlion announced a non-public share placement plan Zoomlion will issue a
maximum of 125bn new shares (A-share) to four strategic investors raising up to
The four strategic investors are Huaijin Cornerstone Taiping Life Insurance Hainan
Chengyisheng and Ningbo Shituo The lock-up period is 18 months
The new shares will account for 158% of the existing os shares The issue price is
The capital will be spent on four areas (1) intelligent manufacturing project for
manufacturing project (4) intelligent manufacturing project of key hydraulic parts
(hydraulic valves)
The share placement plan is subject to the approval of shareholders and CSRC
The share placement plan will help remove the overhang as market had expected a fund-
raising exercise We see several positives in the share placement plan
First the strategic investors have strong background In particular Hainan
Chengyisheng is held as to 2448% 649% and 649% by Zhan Chunxin (executive
Director of Zoomlion) Qin Xiuhong (senior manager) and Yang Duzhi (senior manager)
respectively each as a limited partner The subscription of shares by senior
management should enhance market confidence
Second the lock-up period of 18 months is long which should not exert pressure on
the share price in the foreseeable future
Third the new business areas are attractive with good potential of import substitution
offering new growth drivers to Zoomlion Zoomlion estimates that the IRR of the four
projects will range from 22% to 28%
