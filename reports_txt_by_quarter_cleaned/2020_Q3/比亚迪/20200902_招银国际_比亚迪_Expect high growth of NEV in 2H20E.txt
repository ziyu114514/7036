BYD announced its 1H20 results 1H20 top-line dropped by 3% YoY to
RMB605bn while NP increased by 14% YoY to RMB17bn implying 2Q20
bottom-line recorded a YoY increase of 120% We think 1H20 results were
excellent on stronger-than-expected auto segment performance and mask
business from BYDE The Company guided bottom-line growth of 850%-1017%
YoY in 3Q20E implying the good momentum to sustain in 2H20 We revised up
FY20-22E EPS by 114%53%43% to reflect the strong earnings rebound TP
is lifted slightly to RMB11309 Maintain BUY
 1H20 excellent results In 1H20 revenue from auto and related products
decreased by 6% YoY to RMB320bn whereas revenue from handset
auto and related products increased by 07ppt to 2393% while GPM from
HCAS business increased by 50ppt to 136%  Revenue from rechargeable
batteries and photovoltaic increased 8% YoY to RMB48bn whereas revenue
from other businesses decreased by 39% YoY to RMB260mn
 Strong 2Q20 results were supported by BYDs mask business under
BYDE (285 HK) It can be partially confirmed as the GPM for HCAS increased
by 5ppt In 1H20 operating cash inflow was RMB155bn with an OCFCore
profit ratio of 52 Advance receipt of goodservice increased by RMB37bn
hand One notable item was that BYD has a total of RMB658mn asset
impairment (AR inventory Intangible asset etc) We believe BYD was
flashing out all historical burdens under the disguise of COVID-19 which will
provide a healthier balance sheet in the future
 Auto segment beat our expectations in 1H20 Given sales volume slashed
in 1H20 the auto segment achieved revenue of RMB32bn in 1H20 with a
decrease of only 6% YoY Even though sales volume fell by 304% YoY in
1H20 the unit revenue increased by 36% YoY to RMB202K and GPM from
auto sales also increased by 07ppt YoY to 239% We believe it was mainly
driven by higher proportion (2ppt YoY) of CV sales within the NEV segment
in the domestic market and abroad

BYD (002594 CH)
Expect high growth of NEV in 2H20E
1 Sep 2020
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
Auto sales to have further rebound in 2H20E Led by strong sales from Song Pro
ICE sales grew by 13% YoY while the magnitude of NEV decline narrowed to 9% YoY
in Jul Looking ahead to 2H20E supported by strong consumer demand for Han we
expect PV sales to have a significant rebound Mgmt disclosed Han had accumulated
order backlog of 300k while BYD is ramping up capacity with bottleneck from blade
battery supply BYD guided 4k6k8k shipment capability for Han EV in AugSepOct
and thereafter Furthermore due to the gradual rise in the proportion of Han we
expect that the ASP of NEPV for 2020E will increase by 18% YoY to RMB196K Along
with the recovery of overall Chinas NEV market (both to Bto C business) we expect
BYDs NEPV sales volume to increase by 74% YoY in 2H20E
orders ramp up from its major customers (AppleXiaomi) 2) the increase in shipments
of high-margin smartphones and tablets 3) the shipment of glass and ceramic
products BYDE is entering into a high growth stage The new smart products
(droneelectronic cigarettes) will bring incremental revenue
Valuation is largely unchanged Based on 1H20 operating updates we revise BYDs
FY20-22E EPS up by 114%53%43% mainly on 1) more optimistic auto sales for
higher volume and ASP 2) strong HCIS earnings growth in the near-term and 3) we
trim down cloud rails contribution on more conservative assumption We raise our
NEV segment valuation to reflect the strong NEV sales forecast supported by Han and
new PHEV products with DM40 in 2021E In the meanwhile we revised down our
cloud rail valuation to reflect the possible contact delay affected by the COVID-19
situation in Brazil CMBI TMT team (Alex Ng) has raised THE valuation forecast for
BYDE (285 HK) on 31 Aug 2020 We directly take CMBI valuation on BYDE to be
consistent Based on the SOTP method we derive BYDs overall value at
RMB3630bn in 2021E Our TP for BYD-A is lifted slightly to RMB11309
reflecting 790706x FY2021E PER Reiterate BUY rating
