Why shall we focus on NEV now
NEV market has enormous growth potential
We see enormous growth potential of the NEV market in China NEV market in China
is shaped under the backdrop of energy structure transformation with an aim to achieve
leapfrog development of the China auto industry China NEV market was initially promoted
through heavy subsidy and experienced some disruptions due to government policy
changes Entering into 2020 we think the market is getting mature since 1) China has
formed the worlds largest consumer market for NEV 2) NEV cost has experienced
continuous decline and is about to reach cost-parity line by 2023E 3) government policy
has laid a solid foundation turning from subsidy driven towards non-monetary long-term
development mechanism and 4) NEV upgrade to high-end car model will bring more
434% in 2020-25E with reference to the Chinese governments ambitious 25% NEV
penetration target by 2025E We think the room for future development of NEV is huge
A leapfrog strategy to tackle energy transformation and air pollution
Three main considerations have jointly formed the development strategy of Chinas NEV
industry 1) From the perspective of energy structure Chinas oil import volume is the
highest in the world with a dependence ratio of 72% which affects Chinas energy security；
and 3) NEV development creates a leapfrog opportunity for China auto industry
Subsidy bridge through the path to the worlds largest NEV consumer market
China has ranked No1 globally in terms of both NEV production and sales for four
consecutive years since 2015 The achievements were highly dependent on policy support
however which as a subsidy to the NEV manufacturers has lowered retail price helping
boost end-users demand
In the early stages of the development of NEV we observe the government has expanded
demand through industrial policies including fiscal subsidies purchase tax reductions and
restriction exemption Since 2019 government has gradually withdrawn direct subsidy
while shifting the support from the production side to the user side The government hopes
healthy development in the long run without any government support
We estimate the central and local governments have provided a total of RMB200-300bn
subsidies for NEV industry in the past decade In 2016 the MoF exposed the fraudulent
2017 The adjustment on the subsidy policy has made NEV sales somewhat bumpy in the
past two years However China still realized NEV sales of 1062mn units in 2019
accounting for more than 50% of NEV sales of the global market

NEV market is turning from subsidy-driven towards non-monetary policy tools
As the domestic NEV market grew relative large enough to support its own development
the government hopes to gradually reduce market intervention In Jul 2018 China officially
result global NEV leader such as Tesla (TSLA US) started to set up factory in China By
will be forced to accelerate innovation In the near future from 2021E non-monetary policy
therefore support the development of the NEV industry We expect Chinas NEV market to
experience a market clearance phase while China NEV OEMs will likely to face increasing
Cost reduction is the most critical factor in NEV industry
Subsidy cuts substantially amplify the pressures of cost reduction in the NEV industry The
essence of the industry is to continuously improve cost structure through technology
advancement and the economies of scale brought by growing demand
motor and electronic control) automotive electronics body chassis suspension interior
decoration etc Among them batteries motors and electronic controls constitute three
about 40% of vehicle manufacturing costs In other words the cost of the power battery will
directly affect the manufacturing cost of NEV Therefore the cost reduction pace of power
battery directly determines the future development speed of NEV Given 1) increasing
economies of scale with growing demand 2) the improvement in the first-pass yield due to
the improvement of production technology and 3) an expected cost reduction in raw
material we expect that the unit cost of the battery would continue to decline
According to GGII the price of power batteries has been declining at an annual rate of
about 20% in past 5 years At the end of 2019 the ex-VAT price for the ternary battery
system(pack) was RMB095-105Wh while the price for the LFP system(pack) was
RMB085-095Wh It is expected that the ternary battery pack ex-VAT price will drop below
RMB090Wh while the LFP pack ex-VAT price will drop below RMB08Wh in 2020E
Based on a diminishing path of battery cost we estimate the costs parity to ICE can be
reached as early as 2023E

Government policy laid a solid foundation for long-term development
The Chinese government has provided enormous support from the very beginning of the
NEV development in the country In Sep 2001 MIIT has set up a special project for EV
within the national 863 plan during the Tenth Five-Year Plan period However we
observe that the first rapid growth period of the China NEV industry began in 2012 Since
the Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2012-2020) 节
能与新能源汽车产业发展规划（2012—2020 年） was issued by the State Council and
implemented in 2012 China NEV market has entered into a new phase
Going forward we think recent government policies laid a solid foundation to drive the NEV
industrys sustainable growth For the near term MIIT official just extended the financial
subsidy for NEV by three years to end-2022 on 23 Apr 2020 For the longer-term MIIT
released the New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035) (draft for
have NEVIntelligent connected vehicles(ICV) sales volume accounting for 25%30% of
total vehicle sales by 2025E On 23 Jun 2020 a new version of CAFC and NEV credit
regulation was published with rigorous mechanism designed to promote the future growth
of the NEV industry and to underpin the 2025E target

NEV to break through to high-end vehicles
A00-class NEV sales has begun to decline since 2017 Sales penetration rate of the A-00
class NEV declined from 54% in 2017 to 18% in 2019 Meanwhile the proportion of A-class
NEV sales gradually increased from 36% in 2017 to 51% in 2019 Market share of BC-
class NEV cars also rose from 4%0% in 2018 to 13%3% in 2019 The breakthrough of
NEV towards high-end vehicles reflects that consumers have begun to recognize
of Model 3 At the same time we also observe that many big names in ICE were also
accelerating the pace in electrification For example BBA (Daimler EQ series BMW i series
and Audi e-tron series) have accelerated its electrification strategies from 2020 We expect
a number of new models at different class-levels to be roll out by a variety of OEMs forming
and ICE OEMs but this will also create opportunities such as significantly increasing the
NEV market sales volume as well as ASP boom with increasing high-end vehicle sales

NEV sales to reach 622mn units in 2025E with a CAGR of 43% in
Short-term bumpy EV sales to decline 15% YoY to 102mn units in 2020E
We expect the NEV sales to be 102mn units in 2020E down 15% YoY In 2019 Chinas
NEV productionsales were 124mn121mn units down 23%40% YoY respectively
Looking back on 2019 the subsidies for NEV experienced a steep decline with a maximum
retreat of more than 50% due to the subsidy transition period exited at the end of Jun 2019
with ICE Since Jul 2019 NEV sales started a path heading south until the end of 2019
Oct and Nov 2019 read dramatic decline of 46% and 44% YoY respectively
At the beginning of 2020 CAAM forecasts that Chinas NEV sales will be about 120mn
units in 2020E at similar level as in 2019 However since the supply side was seriously
disrupted the total output in 1H20 has declined by 365% YoY While demand had
volume recorded only 393K in 1H20 down 374% YoY As we expect policy support
measures should underpin the sales performance we believe NEV will achieve an increase
of 10% YoY in 2H20E As a result we revise down our NEV sales forecast to 102mn units
in 2020E a decline of 15%YoY

Medium-term growth to accelerate with a jump in 2021E
Although the subsidy retreats in 2020 are better than previously expected three critical
factors namely reducing costs improving battery life and ensuring safety will still be the
key tasks for the whole NEV industry in the medium-term which will likely prompt
technological progress and meet customer demands As we forecast below NEV
production and sales volume derived from double credit regulation will jump significantly
in 2021E making 2020E a perfect stage to accumulate related shares in NEV sector

Long-term growth to be enormous with 43% CAGR in 2020-25E
Even though the cost of NEV will gradually decrease in the next three years the retail price
will still be higher than the same grade of ICE without any subsidy Given full recognition
with the initial plan in 2020 Beyond financial subsidy we expect that other trends such as
(1) double credits (2) technical support (3) battery charge subsidy at the operation side
may provide additional support
As we mentioned earlier we expect the cost parity with ICE will be achieved between
2023E and 2025E in terms of production cost According to Research on the Development
Trend of Chinese Traditional and New Energy Vehicles 2050 from CATARC it will take 5
cost gap is shrinking rapidly The market share of NEV will expand at accelerated speed
when cost parity nearly achieves
We expect the real demand especially A to C class NEV will start to release shortly from
the proportion of higher-class increases
Starting from 2023E we expect NEV sales volume to grow at an increasing speed with
improving sales structure We take the penetration rate of 25% in 2025E set by MIIT as
given We expect that the sales volume of NEV in China will be 622mn units in 2025E
with a CAGR of 43% between 2020E and 2025E Both NEV OEMs and related NEV

Why do we prefer BYD
BYD is one of the first few auto OEMs that invested in the NEV in China The Company
has accumulated a great amount of technical knowledge while earning increasing brand
recognition BYD has established leading market position in NEV sales In 2019 in terms
of sales volume in a global context BYD was ranked No2 for total NEV sales No3 for
BEV sales and No1 for PHEV sales We think BYD is well in the position to embrace the
opportunities that will arise with the enormous growth potential from the NEV market
As a conglomerate BYD is in the leading position in numbers of its business area such as
NEV power battery IGBT Cloud rail Headset electronics etc In 2020-21E we think BYD
has several eye-catching highlights sequence by
1) releasing DM40 platform in 4Q20 to defense and enlarge it NEV market shares
through PHEV
2) new launching cycle from 2H20E especially its flagship model Han to boost NEV
sales volume
3) launching the new blade battery could be a potential game-changer in the power
battery market
4) opening up battery supply to external customers from its FinDreams supply chains
5) introducing strategic investors and expressed the intention to sell its IGBT module
The business Auto segment accounts the most for revenue and gross profit
BYDs main business can be divided into Automobiles and Related Products (internal
Services Rechargeable Batteries and Photovoltaic and Other business (urban rail
transportation) In 2019 the Company achieved sales revenue of RMB1277bn of which
assembly business 82% came from the secondary rechargeable battery business
(excluding car power batteries) and the remaining 05% came from other main businesses
(include cloud rail) In 2019 GP was RMB208bn of which 665% came from the auto and
the secondary rechargeable battery business (excluding car power batteries) and 01%

In addition to overall PHEV market growth BYD also has cutting-edge dual-mode
technology to support PHEV products BYD expects to launch its 4th-generation PHEV
technology Dual-Mode 40(DM40) in 4Q20E DM40 consists of DM-p and DM-i platforms
DM-p will shape its focus on power output Han DM will be the first model equipped with a
DM-p platform DM-i platform mainly focuses on the cost economy We believe DM-i will
likely to help achieve the cost parity with ICE If BYD can successfully achieve this goal it
will help the Company 1) reiterate its brand recognition 2) expand its market share by
utilizing the cost advantage We expect BYD PHEV will have a strong performance and will
regain market share in 2021E prompted by new car models equipped with DM40 to launch
NEV Highlight 5  To B business
BYD takes advantage of its first-mover advantage and has a strong economic moat
in the fields of EV taxi EV ride-hailing vehicle and EV city bus For example in 2019
about 60K units of EV were sold to operating entities accounting for 27% of its NEPV sales
2015 as the beginning of the electrification among Chinas operating vehicles we expect
that Chinas EV taxisride-hailing vehicle will start the first renewal cycle with an annual

NEV Highlight 6  new launching cycle in 2H20E2021E
Launching blade batteries and Han models will be marked as the origin of the new
product cycle in our view Han a flagship B class vehicle has accumulated over 20K
bookings as of now We believe the monthly sales of Han will reach 3K to 4K with a potential
surprise As previously mentioned all DM models will equip with DM40 in later 2020E A
new product cycle will revert its less-than-demanding performance in 1H20
BYDs NEV market share declined slightly from 197% in 2018 to 190% in 2019 due to
subsidy withdrawal which brought negative impacts to NEV sales However given the six
advantages discussed above we expect BYD to start regain market share in the NEV
sector as the NEV market normalizing back to its trajectory We expect its market
share in the NEV market will bounce back from 182% in 2020E to 188%191% in
2021E22E In terms of ICE we expect BYD also to slightly lose shares as market

Affected by multiple factors such as the emission standard switchsubsidy retreat NEV
sales in China were only 121mn units in 2019 down 40% YoY BYDs NEV sales volume
was 230K in 2019 representing a decrease of 74%YoY Affected by COVID-19 we think
the sales of NEV in China in 2020E will face great pressure as in 2019 However we have
already observed that the central government had extended the subsidy schedule until
2022E from its original subsidy exit plan of 2020E In addition a variety of regions have
also introduced a local subsidy to boost NEV purchase in 2020E Therefore we expect the
sales volume of NEV in China will be to 102mn units a strong rebound from 1H20 but still
indicating a decrease of 15%YoY
We believe that BYDs launch of new batteries (Blade battery) and new models(Han)
will support its overall sales BYD will also release its DM40 version PHEV across its all
major models in 4Q20E At the same time Guangdong and Shenzhen have introduced
NEV subsidy policies that will likely to support BYDs NEV sales Even though BYDs NEV
sales underperformed the market in 1H20 we remain confident in its performance in 2H20
and going forward We expect BYDs new car model launching cycle with cutting the edge
technologies will help the Company further improve its brand recognition which will support
NEV sales In 2020E we forecast NEV will have a sales volume decline of 19% YoY (NEPV
-19%NECV -10%) with NEV sales volume of 1863K units We forecast ASP for NEV will
rise by 7% in 2020E as vehicle typeproduct mix changes In 2021-22E we expect NEV
sales volume to pick up rapidly to 3199K5144K unites respectively while ASP to
maintain upward trends as NEV sales shift to high end models

BYD was one of the auto OEMs that invested heavily in the NEV field and has
increasingly shifted its focus to NEV business With the continuous investment in RD
the Company has accumulated technical advantage in the core technology of NEV supply
chains such as power battery and IGBT Beside BYD also has technological accumulation
in both EV and Hybrid technical routes We believe the subsidy retreat happening now will
lead to NEV sector consolidation and will radically change the over-supply condition We
believe BYD not only has adequate demand to survive this winter but also has the
phase passes
Reorganizing the internal supply chain
The Company initially adopted a vertical integration model in its NEV supply chain
which internalized all production nodes in auto production (model design mold
development key parts design and manufacturing assembly quality control sales
channel management etc) The vertical management model enables the Company to
higher management costsproduction cost
From 2017 BYD gradually opened up its supply chain From the perspective of the supply
reduce procurement costs and management costs From the perspective of the demand

BYDs power battery was previously used for internal supply only However BYD
expressed the intention for external sales given that 1) power battery market has giant
demand high growth potential insight and 2) the Company had accumulated technology
advantages in battery cost leadership and safety performance According to BYD several
OEMs had entered discussions with the Company After the initial trial phases we expect
BYD power battery to have external shipments from 2021 and to reach high shipment
growth in 2022E We estimate the external shipment of BYD batteries to be
0126187GWh in 2020E21E22E respectively The corresponding revenue will reach
RMB0120137bn in 20E21E22E In 2025E we forecast BYD will sell 720GWh
externally with a corresponding revenue of RMB461bn
Overview in the power battery industry
The power battery value chain can be divided into three sectors raw materials in upstream
production in midstream and application in downstream The power battery system can be
simply divided into hardware and software (BMS) The hardware includes a variety of levels
in the production-side namely cell module and the final battery pack The cell can also be
further divided into positive and negative electrodes electrolytes and separators These
are derived from the raw materials which are upstream of the whole value chain
The upstream of power batteries is mainly dominated by mineral resources such as cobalt
manganese nickel and lithium Cobalt manganese nickel lithium and other raw
materials are used as positive electrode materials Lithium ore is also used for both
negative electrode and electrolyte Graphite is mainly used for the negative electrode The
midstream includes the manufacture of the positive electrode negative electrode
electrolyte and separator The downstream of power batteries are mainly OEMs and
energy storage sectors

Power batteries can be mainly classified into two categories LFP(LiFePO4) batteries
and ternary lithium batteries (including nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) nickel
cobalt aluminum (NCA)) Other types such as lithium manganese battery lithium titanate
battery super capacitor have a relatively small proportion One form of power battery
namely solid-state battery may potentially destruct the current landscape However we
believe that the technology of solid-state batteries was immature It is expected to achieve
batteries here
In general LFP has the characteristics of good safety and low cost while the ternary
battery has a longer mile range given higher energy density Due to the difference in
application scenarios about 93% of BEV buses were equipped with LFP while about 74%
of BEV PV were installed with ternary lithium batteries

In the ternary lithium battery technical route the development direction is determined to be
high nickel which mainly solves the problem of mile range At the same time due to the
scarcity and monopoly of cobalt resources high nickel also minimizes the supply chain risk
The 811 monomer energy density can reach 280Whkg According to SMM NCM811

BYD will change the game - Blade battery
However BYD chose to focus on LFP battery development BYD has consistently
optimized the physical structure of the LFP battery in order to improve its mile range by
increasing the system energy density
In 2019 BYD has deployed NCM on all PVs while used LFP on all CVs The situation has
changed recently as BYD released its blade battery on 29 Mar 2020 As one of LFP
batteries the most important achievement of blade battery is that it improves the overall
advantage of high safety and long lifespan of traditional LFP In the nail penetration test
the ternary battery can only achieve safety at the pack level while the blade battery can
elevate it to the cell level At the same time the blade battery can make the new car NEDC
last more than 600 kilometers It will be first used in Han EV in 3Q20E and then
subsequently equipped on Qin Pro Qin EV Song Plus etc in 4Q20E

In terms of cost the blade battery was 20-30% lower than the main-stream NCM811
at the pack level In addition luxury brands may focus more on safety as reputation risk
were greater than new entries Such a significant cost advantage will provide great
increase further as BYD is in the process of RD in the second generation of blade battery

landscape While maintaining its safety nature of LFP it has increased the mile range As
a result the blade battery broadens the application scenarios of LFP battery enabling it to
be assembled in A to C-class NEVs In the meanwhile due to the nature of the ternary
lithium battery the risk of thermal runaway when facing the acupuncture experiment is
higher than that of the LFP battery We expect that BYD will focus on safety in the
marketing of blade battery so as to gain more market share in this sub-segment Given
diverse demand from customers blade battery will definitely fit in certain safety demands
and will gain more market shares In other words ternary lithium batteries will face

Total power battery market size in China
According to the GGII the total installed capacity of power batteries in China was 628GWh
in 2019 CATL was the dominant player in the power battery industry with a market share
of 518% BYD was the 2nd largest player with a market share of 173%
According to the CMBIS estimate we forecast that the total installed capacity of power
batteries in China will be 556Gwh in 2020E a decline of 108%YoY due to COVID-19
impacts However given CMBIS forecast on Chinas NEV industry through 2025E we
are confident that power battery installation will rebound back to its high growth
path in 2021E as NEV sales normalize to its high growth trajectory

We expect BYD to have a total production capacity of 50GWh in 2020E which is fully
capable of internal production Among all production capacity NCMLFPBlade accounts
for 301010GW respectively As of now BYD has a total production capacity of a blade
battery of 10GWh equivalent to about 180K units of the vehicle In 2020E we expect the
blade battery will prioritize internal supply as production was still in the ramp-up period If
we take unit installed capacity of 54Wh we expect a total production capacity of 093mn
units NEV in 2020E BYD ranks No2 in Chinese power battery supplier in terms of total
installed capacity with a leading position in battery density and safety aspects Based on
our calculation BYD has idle capacity for external sales According to the Companys
guidance we expect the blade battery will be sold to external clients in late 2021Eearly

we expect that the external shipment of power batteries will skyrocket from 2021E22E We
forecast the external shipment of BYD batteries to be 0126187GWh in 2020E21E22E

We adopt the SOTP method to evaluate BYDs value We derive BYDs overall value of
45% of the newly emerging Power Battery business We apply a 15% conglomerate
RMB11212 per share implying a 260% upside We initiate BYD-A with BUY
For short-term to medium term we think BYDs valuation will be sensitive to 1) monthly
sales figure release of new car model 2) power battery and IGBTs progress on the external
shipment in 2021-22E and 3) progress of potential spin-off of power battery and IGBT
business in the A-share market
Valuation is experiencing re-rating
Looking back at BYD-As share price history in the past five years a forward PER valuation
was ranged between 266x and 879x with an average of 523x forward PBR valuation was
ranged between 19x and 45x with an average of 29x
BYDs valuation exhibited quite significant policy sensitivity We observed obvious re-rating
from Jul 2017 as BYD-A was traded up 1 level from -1 STD to 1 STD driven by 1)
Chinese governments establishment of long-term NEV promotion mechanism through
releasing policy draft of the double credit system and 2) BYD was launching new flagship
MPV car called Song Max We think the markets recognition of NEVs long-term high
From Jun 2020 we think BYD is experiencing another re-rating process on the back of 1)
Chinese governments revised double credit policy and target enforcement of the policy
from 2021 2) NEV purchase subsidy to sustain with a step-down scheme until end-2022
3) BYD launching new Han series car model and blade battery and more importantly 4)
opening up supply chain strategy release value of power battery and IGBT business
Although share price has experienced a significant rebound of 92% from a year low at year
begin we believe the re-rating process is not yet finished and we think our rigorous
valuation model supports our view

Since BYD just opened up its power battery supply chain to external customers there is
no clear earnings data to support the valuation We project BYD power batterys long term
growth path based on the assumptions that the Company will gain NEV installation market
shares in China and we expect the segment to have relatively stable net profit margin rate
at 15% with reference to CATL (300750 CH) a pure-play market leader of the power battery
business In 2025E we estimate the BYD power battery to seize 340% market share in
China shipping 72GWh to external customers realizing revenue and net profit of
RMB46bnRMB75bn respectively

valuation We also project IGBTs expansion and external shipment path till 2025E based
on several key assumptions including capacity addition utilization rate increasing ASP
trend as NEV sales shift towards high-end models as well as net profit margin Our net
profit margin is set based on StarPower (603290 CH) a pure-play IGBT module
manufacturer just entering the NEV IGBT market In 2025E we estimate BYD IGBT to
seize 333% market share in China shipping 107mn sets to domestic car installation
realizing revenue and net profit of RMB293bnRMB880mn respectively
We apply 35x PER (based on 1X PEG) on 2025E earnings and discount back to 2021
based on 85% WACC to derive the 2021E IGBT valuation of RMB222bn Taking 723%
of the total equity ratio we estimate that value attributable to BYD will be RMB160bn
StarPower is currently has a market value of RMB388bn trading at FY20E 214x PER with
274% earnings CAGR in 2019-22E Comparing with StarPower we believe BYD has two
advantages 1) cover all types of vehicle from A0 to B class (StarPower can only apply to
A0) 2) great tracking record and larger market share in vehicle level IGBT 3) high growth
potential as BYD will expand production capacity 4) great reputation while StarPower has
fraudulent tracking record As for a reference BYD issued an announcement on 15 Jun
introduced a total of 30 strategic investors After the A round of financing the valuation of
BYD Semiconductor has reached RMB102bn The Company plans to take its IGBT
business public listed in 2H21E We think our valuation for BYDs IGBT business is justified
and the potential IPO will further unlock the segments value

Note  BYD had an A round equity financing by 15 Jun 2020 After the fund raising BYD holds 723% shares
of BYD Semiconductor (ie the IGBT business)
In Jun 2018 the State Council issued the Opinions on Further Strengthening the
Management of Urban Rail Transit Planning and Construction 关于进一步加强城市轨道
交通规划建设管理的意见(国办发201852 号)(52 号文) tightening the application
criteria for the construction of urban rail projects However we observe recent policy
updates indicating policy loss in this field Since 2020 the Chinese government has begun
to emphasize new infrastructure Infrastructure projects in such fields as 5G networks
extra-high-voltage power transmission projects inter-city transit vehicle charging stations
big data centers industrial networks and projects exhibiting Internet of Things
characteristics are all considered to be examples of new infrastructure Urban rail is the
only sub-field included in both new infrastructure and traditional infrastructure
Given the policy spur and project progress we forecast that the revenue from Cloud Rail
in 2021E will reach RMB73bn We expect the cloud rail will get out of the dull pattern in
the past and head to a high growth period in the next few years We take CRRC (601766
CH NR) as our valuation reference The forward average PS ratio of CRRC was 135x
while we take 150x PS for BYD to reflect the high potential growth potential backed by
contacts signed We derive the Cloud Rail segments valuation of RMB110bn in 2021E
Other potentials values
Though we have considered major explicit and implicit valuation we believe BYD still has
other potential values that can be unlocked in the future
1) Conservative market assumption We only consider NEV sales power battery IGBT
module under the backdrop of China domestic market for now If BYD starts to expand its
business aboard we think the valuation will have the potential to rise further

2) Other hidden business segments In addition to explicit and implicit valuation
mentioned in our previous discussion we believe BYD still has additional values that can
be potentially realized in the future such as the NEV motor segment platform technology
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
Comers (NIO Weltmeister Xpeng etc) and foreign brands (Tesla BBA etc) are gradually
continue to gain market share BYD not only has to have the technical advantage as
previously mentioned but also form its own marketing strategy and product ecology
Slower external shipment process
As we mentioned BYDs valuation reflects its external shipments of power batteries and
IGBT modules We expect BYD will start selling its NEV parts in 2021E However affected
by COVID-19 the external supply process may be slower than expected in terms of product
certification and business development It may affect the short-term market sentiment even
though the long-term shipment process will stay intact
Unexpected technology route change
BYD placed major auto technology focus on BEV and PHEV The Company is also making
considerable investments in LFP based blade power batteries If FEV or battery technology
and product streams will be flipped and it will have material impacts on product sales and
earnings performance of the Company
Policy support is less than expected
NEV sales still heavily rely on purchase subsidy as NEV is yet to reach cost-parity to ICE
Our short term NEV sales projection is based on the expectation of the enforcement of the
double credit system from 2021E while long term sales projection is based on the
governments NEV sales penetration rate target If the government accelerates the existing
subsidy reduction plan or changing the future NEV penetration outlook it will have material
impacts on product sales and earnings performance of the Company
