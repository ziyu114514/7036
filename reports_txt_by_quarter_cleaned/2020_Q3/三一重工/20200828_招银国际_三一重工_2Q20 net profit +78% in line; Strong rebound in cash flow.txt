BUY (Maintain)
(previous TP              RMB2470)
UpDownside
SANYs net profit in 1H20 came in at RMB85bn up 255% YoY Net profit in
2Q20 surged 78% YoY to RMB63bn In particular operating cash inflow
significantly rebounded to RMB94bn in 2Q versus an outflow of RMB895mn in
1Q While we fine-tuned our 2020E earnings forecast by -5% due mainly to lower
assumption on the concrete machinery sales and the blended gross margin we
slightly raised our 2021E-22E earnings forecast by 1% as we expect further
operating cost reduction We raised our TP from RMB247 to RMB264 based
on 16x 2020E PE (up from 143x) on the back of 16% estimated earnings growth
in 2021E SANY remains the key beneficiary of strong infrastructure spending
growth and strict emission control policies Reiterate BUY
 Key highlights on 1H20 results Revenue grew 13% YoY to RMB49bn
driven mainly by a 17% YoY increase in excavator revenue Revenue from
concrete machinery sales only increased by 5% YoY slightly below our
expectation Gross margin narrowed by 2ppt YoY to 303% which was largely
due to the impact of COVID-19 in 1Q SANY maintained a stringent expense
control in 1H20 with SD expense ratio reduced by 18ppt YoY SANY
maintained its RD spending growth which we believe is essential for
 Sharp recovery in 2Q20 Revenue grew 45% YoY to RMB32bn in 2Q a
significant improvement from a decline of 19% in 1Q While the gross margin
was down 24ppt YoY to 315% it improved 33ppt QoQ All these together
In particular the operating cash inflow reached RMB94bn suggesting
excellent cash flow management
 High visibility on the 2H20E outlook According to CCMA excavator sales
volume (for the industry as a whole) grew 55% YoY in Jul In addition based
on Jiangsu Henglis (601100 CH BUY) latest order intakes of hydraulic
cylinders we expect the momentum of excavator demand to continue over
to accelerate in 2H20E on the back of the recovery of property construction
 Key risks (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic (2) Slowdown of
construction activities (3) Risk of expanding to financing business
