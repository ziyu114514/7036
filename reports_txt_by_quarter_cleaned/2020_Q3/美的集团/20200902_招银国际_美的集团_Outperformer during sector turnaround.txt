2Q20 was highly resilient for Midea and we are more positive on 2H20E given a
less promotional environment and strong export orders outlook Therefore we
maintain BUY and lifted TP to RMB 8657 based on 20x FY21E PE (up from 17x
FY20E) vs China Intl peers avg of 22x 18x
 1H20E results slight beat Midea sales net profit att declined by 10% 8%
YoY to RMB 1361bn 139bn in 1H20 above BBGs est by 2% 9% We
attributed the beat to better-than-expected exports and cost control in 2Q20
39ppt reduction of GP margin to 256% in 1H20 was due to 1) change in
accounting standard and 2) relocating of installation fees to COGS (from
selling expenses) GP margin would have fallen by only 1ppt after adjustments
 Rapid turnaround in 2Q20 where AC and fridge outperformed Midea
resumed a 3% YoY sale growth in 2Q20 from 23% drop in 1Q20 A healthy
pick up in domestic and resilient overseas was also seen in 2Q20 where sales
growth for both AC fridge accelerated to 8% 15% in 2Q20 (vs -10% 3% in
1Q20) and sales decline for washing machines small appliances also
narrowed to 8% 5% in 2Q20 (vs -15% -10% in 1Q20)
 A better domestic as price war reverses with decent weather We reckon
that ASP for AC had been climbing since Apr 2020 as Midea and Haier
changed their focus from market shares to profitability (push for premium)
while Gree is still being held back by its high channel inventory Moreover
thanks to 1) exceptionally hot weather during summer 2) introduction of new
energy-saving standard and 3) flexibly inventory level (powered by the
efficient T3 model) we believe ASP is likely to trend up from 2H20E onwards
 Overseas to bottom out with an at least stable GP margin According to
the management overseas sales growth rebounded to 15% YoY in Jul-Aug
2020 much better than guidance of 0% growth in FY20E Also we believe
more premium product sales and easing of raw material costs can more than
offset CNY appreciation and driving an at least stable GP margin in 2H20E
 Guiding for a flattish sales NP att growth in FY20E We find this target
reasonable as Midea is effectively gaining shares in both the recovering
domestic and overseas markets while the only let down is KUKA as various
clients are still conservative or reluctant to spend capex in near term
 Maintain BUY but raised TP to RMB 8657 (21% upside) We reiterate BUY
because of 1) industry leading sales and inventory management and 2)
sector turnaround and potential re-rating We fine-tuned FY20E 21E 22E NP
by 1% 1% 2% to factor in better export and weaker KUKA Our new TP is
based on 20x FY21E PE (up from 17x FY20E) The counter now trades at
17x 21E PE (vs China peers avg of 22x) or 19x PEG (vs China peers 21x)
