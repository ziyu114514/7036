LONGi delivered outstanding 1H20 results 2Q20 net profit was RMB2252mn
up 611% YoY refreshing quarter earnings new high Strong earnings was mostly
driven by module external shipment growth by 1402% to 47GW during the
quarter while we estimate GPM of mono-wafer sales were above 30% despite
continuous price cut in Apr-May Looking ahead to 2H20 though uncertainties
appear to increase with pricing and costs fluctuation we think LONGi will likely
offset those impacts through accelerating shipment growth We raise FY20-22E
EPS forecast by 399% - 548% to RMB208258312 Our TP is lifted to
RMB7240 based on 281x FY21E PER Upgrade to BUY rating
 2Q20 results beat 2Q external module shipment surged 1062% YoY to
4708MW while external wafer shipment stay relatively flat at 1112mn pieces
down 50% YoY The Company recognized RMB406mn impairment losses
mainly from RMB427mn for Taizhou and Chuzhou plants and largely offset
from excess cash management Net interests gain was recorded for the
consecutive second quarter as LONGi maintained in a net cash position For
1H20 net profit was RMB4116mn up 1048% YoY significantly higher than
ours and market estimates
 Strong overseas module shipment sustained excellent profitability
LONGi realized wafermodule external shipment of 247bn piece658GW in
1H20 up 149%1062% YoY Module sales was a highlight as LONGi had 52%
module shipped to overseas market and US module sales offered explicit high
margin with significantly higher ASP (RMB30-50cents vs domestic spot price)
Wafer sales recorded high GPM at 40% in 1Q20 and we estimate wafer sales
GPM was above 33% though experienced continuous price cut in Apr-May In
a challenging environment came with impacts from COVID-19 LONGi still
maintained smooth sales with limited impacts on profitability in our view
 Pricecosts impacts to be offset by shipment growth Recent pricecosts
fluctuate along the PV supply chain had brought impacts to wafer margin and
module demand uncertainties Based on current pricing structure wafer GPM
declined to 24% by end-Aug according to our estimate We are not over concern
on the short term turbulence as LONGi has state of the art PERC cell (efficiency
at 23%) leading product costs structure and strong overseas module sales
network In 2H20 we expect LONGi to meet its sales target implying
748%1564% which we see strong enough to offset pricecosts impacts

2Q20 results beat shipment growth to offset
pricing and costs impacts in 2H20
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
 Raise TP to RMB7240 upgrade to BUY We overestimate price and margin
impacts to LONGi brought by COVID-19 in our previous estimate In extremely
challenging context in 2018-2020 (such as Chinese governments 531 policy
in 2018 project approval delay in 2019 and COVID-19 disruption in 2020)
solar demand was resilient on the track with continuous improving cost
demand to restore its booming track from 2H20 Based on 1H20 operating
and financial updates we raise LONGis FY20-22E EPS estimates by
399%429%548% to RMB208258312 Our TP based on FY21E 281x
is raised to RMB7240 We upgrade LONGi from Hold to BUY
 Risk factors 1) cell technology upgrade to HJT at faster-than-expected pace
and 2) short of Poly-Si to support capacity expansion in 2021E
