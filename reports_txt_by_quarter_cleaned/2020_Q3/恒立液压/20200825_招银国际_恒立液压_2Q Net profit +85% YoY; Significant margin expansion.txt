Sector  Sustainable demand for
excavator in 2H20E  12 Aug 2020
China Construction Machinery 
HDT Sector  Raise industry sales
upcycle  30 Jun 2020
SHSZ300  (rebased)
Henglis net profit in 1H20 grew 47% YoY to RMB986mn implying an impressive
net profit growth of 85% YoY in 2Q Gross margin of 445% in 2Q is a record high
suggesting high utilization rate and strong pricing power We revised up our
earnings forecast in 2020E-22E by 5-8% (12-15% above consensus) after
incorporating higher gross margin assumption and lower expense ratios After
rolling over the valuation base to 2021E we raised our TP to RMB82 based on
unchanged multiple of 45x PE We believe the fast-growing pump and valve
sales will continue to lend support to the valuation Maintain BUY
 Key highlights on 1H20 results Revenue grew 24% YoY to RMB346bn and
gross margin significantly expanded 49ppt YoY to 419% This coupled with
lower SGA ratios boosted the net profit growth of 47% YoY Operating cash
inflow in 1H20 increased by 19% YoY to RMB944mn In 2Q20 net profit
surged 85% YoY to RMB639mn mainly driven by 71% YoY increase in
revenue and 46ppt YoY gross margin expansion (to 445%)
 Solid sales growth in 1H20 Sales volume of hydraulic cylinder for excavator
grew 27% YoY 330k units The segment revenue grew 16% YoY to RMB14bn
a result of lower ASP due to higher demand for small-size excavators
Hydraulic Technology the major subsidiary with a focus on hydraulic pump
and valve reported revenue growth of 86% YoY Revenue of non-
standardized hydraulic cylinders dropped 9% YoY to RMB577mn
 Production volume staying high in Jul  Aug Based on our understanding
Henglis monthly production volume reached 53k units in Jul and is expected
to reach 54k units in Aug Such monthly volume suggests strong downstream
demand Besides production volume of pumps and valves are expected to
stay high in 3Q
 Key risks (1) Slowdown of construction activities (2) risk of overseas
expansion (3) increase in raw materials cost
