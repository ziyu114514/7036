210% YoY to RMB965bn with revenue from continuing operations rising by
231% YoY to RMB939bn Adjusted non-IFRS net profit surged by 400% YoY to
RMB268bn Both revenue and net profit continued the quarterly improvement

of the end of 1Q25 the Companys backlog grew by 471% YoY to RMB5233bn

projecting a 1015% YoY increase in revenue from continuing operations and
expansion in the adjusted non-IFRS net profit margin
 TIDES business gained momentum with strong growth WuXi AppTecs
TIDES business experienced strong growth 1Q25 with revenue soaring
1876% YoY to RMB224bn an acceleration from the 701% growth in 2024
According to mgmt the growth was driven by the ramp-up of new capacities
and contributions from oral GLP-1 programs TIDES backlog more than
doubled increasing by 1055% YoY as of 1Q25 providing a solid foundation
for sustained growth The Company remains on track to expand its peptide
capacity to over 100k liters by the end of 2025 Hence Mgmt continued to
expect TIDES revenue to grow more than 60% YoY in 2025
 Early-stage business remained under pressure with signs of moderate
recovery Revenue from Biology segment grew 82% YoY in 1Q25 marking a
second consecutive quarter of positive growth indicating a recovery in client
demand for drug discovery services In Chemistry segment small-molecule drug
discovery revenue declined 71% YoY an improvement from the 287% YoY
drop in 2024 Testing segment remained affected by pricing pressure Lab testing
revenue slid 49% YoY (vs -80% YoY in 2024) with safety assessment revenue
falling 78% YoY (vs -130% YoY in 2024) Mgmt noted that pricing appeared to
have reached a trough although a meaningful recovery will still take time
 Strengthening shareholder returns amid market uncertainties WuXi
AppTecs Board of Directors has proposed a series of shareholder return
initiatives including maintaining a 30% annual cash dividend payout ratio
issuing a one-time RMB1bn special dividend in 2025 introducing the interim
dividend plan in 2025 and repurchasing and cancelling RMB1bn A-shares
(announced on March 17) In addition the Company announced a second
RMB1bn A-share repurchase and cancellation plan on April 8 which has now
programs total nearly RMB6bn equivalent to 62% of 2024 attributable net
 Maintain BUY Due to the macro uncertainties such as the US-China trade
war we revise down forecasts and now expect revenue from continuing
operation business to grow by 133%149%159% YoY and adjusted non-
respectively (previously 144%152%163% and 117%190%161%
YoY) We thus cut our DCF-based TP from RMB9405 to RMB7722 (WACC
942% terminal growth 200% both unchanged) Our estimates are higher
than Bloomberg consensus reflecting our confidence in earnings resilience
