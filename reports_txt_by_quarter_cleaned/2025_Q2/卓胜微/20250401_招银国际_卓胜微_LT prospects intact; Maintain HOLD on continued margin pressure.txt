CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Maxscend (300782 CH)
continued margin pressure
Maxscend released its FY24 results Revenue went up by 25% YoY to
RMB45bn missing CMBI estimatesBBG consensus by 2%1% NP declined
significantly by 642% YoY to RMB402mn missing CMBI estimatesBBG
consensus by 28%21% GPMNPM declined by 70ppt167ppt to 395%90%
in FY24 (vs 464%256% in FY23) due to margin pressure from subsidiary
strategy We remain constructive on Maxscends long-term growth prospects as
it builds platform-level manufacturing capability and strategic supply chain
independence However we maintain HOLD rating as near-term margin
pressure persists with TP adjusted downward to RMB820 based on a
rolled-over 45x 2026E PE
 4Q24 experienced net loss for the first time due to fab ramp-up margin
pressure remains an overhang in 2025 In 4Q24 revenue declined by
142% YoY but increased by 34% QoQ while bottom-line saw a net loss of
RMB24mn Mgmt attributed the loss to increased depreciation and high
mask costs tied to the migration of key products onto its in-house 612-inch
lines NPM was -21% in 4Q24 (vs 66%232% in 3Q244Q23) We believe
Maxscend will face ongoing margin headwinds especially in 1H25 (GPM
380% on our estimates) given fabs ramp-up and slow recovery in end-
market demand We forecast Margin to gradually recover in 2H25 (GPM
417% on our estimates) on seasonality and emerging demand from AI
edge devices We project overall GPM to be slightly up to 402% in FY25E
(395% in FY24)
 Module momentum continues as vertical integration starts to pay off
Module sales (42% of total rev) grew by 186% YoY in FY24 while discrete
sales (56% of total rev) declined by 76% YoY The growth in module
revenue reflects the modularization trend in RFFE industry Looking
forward we expect module business to be the key growth driver (25% YoY
in 2025E) The rise in module shipments reflects Maxscends in-house
wafer and packaging capabilities enabling faster product iteration and
were 36%42% in FY24 down from 46%47% in FY23 but are likely to
improve as utilization increases in our view
 Maintain HOLD with TP adjusted down to RMB82 We view 2025 as a
transition year for Maxscend and we revise down our revenueNP forecasts
by 7%42% in FY25E given a slower-than-expected recovery in demand
and stronger margin erosion on fab ramp-up Our new TP is based on 45x
2026E PE 10% higher than peers avg of 407x considering its leading
position in RFFE market and important role in semiconductor localization
Potential upside catalysts stronger-than-expected recovery and faster
semiconductor localization due to geopolitical risks Potential downside
risks slower-than-expected capacity ramp-up delay in RD progress
