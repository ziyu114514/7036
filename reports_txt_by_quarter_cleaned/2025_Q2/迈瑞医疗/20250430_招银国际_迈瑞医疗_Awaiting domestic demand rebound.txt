CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Mindray (300760 CH)
Awaiting domestic demand rebound
In 2024 Mindray reported revenue of RMB 367bn (51% YoY) and attributable
net profit of RMB 117bn (07% YoY) GPM dropped by 11 ppts YoY to 631%
primarily due to 1) pricing pressure on IVD reagents and mid- to low-end medical
equipment 2) weaker IVD testing demand following DRG 20 implementation
and inter-hospital recognition of test results The proportion of revenue from IVD
reagent declined in 4Q24 The Sino-US trade frictions may raise costs for US-
sourced raw materials in 2025E while Mindray is actively seeking substitutes to
protect margins In 1Q25 Mindrays revenue fell by 121% YoY to RMB82bn
mainly due to 1) over 20% YoY decline in domestic revenue as revenue
recognition lagged behind procurement recovery 2) a high overseas revenue
base in 1Q24 (up nearly 30% YoY) resulting in slow 1Q25 overseas growth of
 Steady growth from overseas In 2024 overseas revenue grew by 213%
YoY to RMB164bn accounting for 447% of total revenue (60ppts) Ex-
North America revenue rose 26% YoY to RMB138bn with Asia-Pacific
continuing as the growth engine Mindray achieved further breakthroughs in
high-end markets with high-end strategic customers contributing 14% of
overseas revenue With enhanced localization and installations of high-end
products such as the MT 8000 we expect the overseas revenue to grow by
a mid-teens percentage in 2025E As the US contributed only 6% of
Mindrays total revenue the impact of trade frictions may be moderate
Diversified manufacturing across 13 countries and proactive inventory
management should help mitigate related risks
 Domestic market remained under pressure In 2024 domestic revenue
decreased by 51% YoY to RMB203bn Revenue from PMLS and MIS
segments fell 31% YoY and 2% YoY respectively due to weak hospital
procurement According to IQVIA Chinas medical equipment market
decreased 123% YoY in 2024 Policy headwinds including DRG 20 inter-
hospital recognition of test results and reagent price cuts further weighed
on IVD revenue IQVIA estimated a decline in the biochemical market and
flat growth in immunology market in 2024 Therefore Mindrays domestic
IVD revenue increased 1% YoY in 2024 However Joinchain data shows a
675% YoY increase in medical equipment bidding value in 1Q25 indicating
potential recovery of domestic medical equipment procurement We
anticipate the revenue recovery will occur in 2H25E primarily due to the
time lag between the bidding process and revenue recognition
 Maintain BUY Given the uncertainties of the timeline of domestic
procurement recovery and trade frictions we revise down our earnings
forecasts We expect revenue and attributable net profit to grow 94% and
65% YoY respectively in 2025E Based on a 9-year DCF model we adjust
our TP to RMB24919 (WACC 92% terminal growth rate 30%)
