Solid FY24 earnings amid accelerated semi
supply chain domestication
Naura announced key financials regarding its FY241Q25 earnings FY24
revenue went up by 351% YoY to RMB298bn (33% below our estimatein-line
with consensus) The strong revenue growth was driven by technology
breakthroughs in core product lines that enabled broader product coverage and
supported continued market share gains In FY24 net profit went up by 442%
YoY to RMB56bn (32%16 below our consensus) During the period NPM
improved to 188% (vs 177% in FY23) on better operating efficiency For 1Q25
RMB82bn (beating consensus by 55%) and mid-point net profit to grow 403%
YoY to RMB16bn (beating BBG consensus by 125%) 1Q25 mid-point NPM
would be 194% (vs 192% in 1Q24) Reiterate BUY with TP revised up to
RMB512 based on 36x FY25E PE (vs prev 30x) in-line with industry
peers average PE of 36x
 Backed by ongoing innovation and technology breakthroughs in core
Mgmt attributed the strong revenue growth to the successful
CCP etchers PECVD ALD vertical furnaces etc which significantly
308% YoY in 2025E on continuous market share gains and new product
 Reiterate BUY with TP revised up to RMB512 We maintain our forecasts
for 202526E The new TP is based on 36x FY25E PE (peers avg) vs
previous 30x We expect semi-industry consolidation in China to accelerate
in 2025 which is one of the key themes in our 2025 outlook report Chinas
leading semi cap players are well-positioned to benefit from domestic self-
sufficiency initiatives and MA momentum Meanwhile we believe the
recently announced US reciprocal tariffs on China (effective 2 April) are
generates all revenue domestically with no exposure to foreign markets In
the long term the tariff serves as a catalyst for faster supply chain
localization efforts a clear tailwind for leading domestic players like Naura
 Key risks lower-than-expected domestic foundry capex plan slower-than-
expected RD progress higher raw material costs etc
