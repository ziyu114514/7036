CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH)
Higher expenses are transitory eyes on new
Henglis reported net profit in 4Q24 1Q25 was -4% YoY 3% YoY and came
in slightly lower than our expectation due to higher administrative expenses
That said the higher expenses were due to the booking of depreciation of
Mexico production plant and precision business (ball screws and linear motion)
as a result of the transfer of construction-in-progress to fixed assets We fine-
tune our 2025E26E earnings forecast by -2% We are staying positive on Hengli
and revise up our TP to RMB92 (previously RMB64) based on 35x 2025E PE
(equivalent to historical average  1SD) as (1) we roll over our valuation to
will serve as the important growth driver in the medium term Maintain BUY
 Key highlights in 2024 results Revenue in 2024 grew 5% YoY to
RMB10bn (1%10%2%2% growth of hydraulic cylinders  pump  valve 
YoY to 426% driven by hydraulic cylinders EBIT however was flat YoY
largely due to a 18ppt YoY increase in administrative expense ratio (to
63%) Net profit was RMB25bn stable YoY In 4Q24 net profit dropped
4% YoY to RMB717mn due to a 7% YoY decline in revenue and higher
administrative expense ratio (34ppt to 87%)
 Key highlights in 1Q25 results EBIT dropped 9% YoY to RMB579mn as
the 3% YoY increase in revenue was offset by 07ppt YoY contraction of
gross margin (to 394%) and an increase in expense ratio in general Helped
YoY to RMB618mn which accounted for 21% of our full-year estimates (run
rate in 1Q24 22%)
 Potential reduction of segment loss in 2025E We understand that the
loss attributable to Mexico production plant and precision business was
RMB100mn due to the depreciation of newly-added fixed assets Hengli
sees chances of loss reduction in 2025E when product delivery increases
 Outlook on ball screws The current annual capacity of ball screws is
enough to support production value of RMB700-800mn Hengli targets to
increase the capacity to RMB2bn equivalent to 100k units of ball screws

weakness in the demand for hydraulic
