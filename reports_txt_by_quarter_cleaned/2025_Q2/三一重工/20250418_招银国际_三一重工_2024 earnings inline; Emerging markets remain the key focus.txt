2024 earnings inline Emerging markets remain
SANY Heavy (SANY) net profit in 2024 came in at RMB597bn (32% YoY)
which is 0%-2% versus ourBloomberg consensus estimates The proposed
dividend implies a 51% pay-out ratio (up from 41% in 2023) which is the highest
since 2017 During the post-results call SANY revealed that emerging markets
such as Asia Pacific Africa the Middle East and South America will be the key
focus while it remained cautious on the US  Europe market due to geopolitics
Management also highlighted the potential of large-sizemining excavators
going forward We maintain our view that SANY remains the best proxy to play
the upcycle of excavators We slightly revise up our 2025E26E earnings
forecast by 57% Accordingly we revise up our TP to RMB22 (from RMB21)
based on an unchanged target PE of 24x (equivalent to 05SD above the
average of 20x since 2017) Our above-average multiple is to reflect the
earnings upcycle Maintain BUY
