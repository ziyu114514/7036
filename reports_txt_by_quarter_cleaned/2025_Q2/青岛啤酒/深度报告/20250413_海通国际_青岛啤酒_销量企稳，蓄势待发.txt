APPENDIX 1
The change of the board chairman and the integration of the beverage business have promoted organizational rejuvenation
conforming to the new trends in the industrys development As the first year of Chairman Jiang Zongxiangs tenure in 2025 there
is sufficient internal driving force within the organization and the optimization of performance assessment is expected to stimulate
the restoration of Tsingtao Brewerys market share In March it was announced that Tsingtao Brewery Group and Qingdao
Beverage Group would implement strategic restructuring and integration By integrating channel and industrial chain resources a
full industrial chain ecosystem covering alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages will be constructed which not only consolidates the
advantages of the beer main business but also expands into high-growth tracks such as healthy beverages In terms of marketing
meeting consumers purchasing needs and consumption experiences in the Internet era through multiple channels In 2024 the
sales volume in on-trade markets such as catering and nightlife accounted for about 412% and the sales volume in off-trade
markets such as KA and circulation channels accounted for about 588%
In 2024 although the sales volume was under pressure the structural upgrade and cost reduction and efficiency improvement
respectively with a year-on-year decrease of -53% an increase of 18% and 62% respectively Although the revenue declined
due to the pressure on sales volume the product structural upgrade the decline in costs and the reasonable control of expenses
year-on-year to 7538 million kiloliters the price per ton increased by 06% year-on-year to 4263 yuan per kiloliter The sales
volume of the main brands mid-to-high-end products mid-to-low-end products of the main brand Laoshan brand decreased by
-27% -102% and -72% respectively year-on-year and the proportion of mid-to-high-end products and above increased by 14
percentage points year-on-year to 418% The cost per ton decreased by -20% year-on-year to 2548 yuan per kiloliter the sales
management expense ratio increased by 04 decreased by -01 percentage points year-on-year to 143%44% and the net profit
The inflection point of the improvement in volume and price appeared in the fourth quarter of 2024 and a recovery in 2025 is
volume price per ton increased by 74% 56% and 17% respectively year-on-year The product structural upgrade accelerated
and the sales volume of mid-to-high-end products and above increased by 109% year-on-year and the proportion increased by
24 percentage points to 498% The improvement in prosperity before and after the Spring Festival continued and the sales
volume in the first quarter is expected to achieve low single-digit growth Currently the channel inventory is within one month
Coupled with the sufficient demand for restocking before the peak season it provides strong support for subsequent growth We
expect the annual sales volume to grow at a low to mid single-digit rate and the price per ton will also increase steadily driven by
the price range of 6-10 yuan On the cost side since the beginning of this year the prices of packaging materials such as glass and
aluminum have continued to decline and the price of imported barley has remained stable It is expected that the cost per ton
expense ratio will remain stable in 2025 and there is a strong certainty of profit improvement throughout the year
Investment thesis Against the backdrop of intensified geopolitical frictions and fluctuations in the trade environment the
brand heritage Tsingtao Brewery can defend with a safe dividend margin The dividend payout ratio in 2024 reached 69% and
the dividend yields of AH shares respectively exceeded 28% and 4% it can also attack to capture the dividends of performance
achieve a double increase driving the release of profit elasticity and at the same time the valuation center will also see a repair
opportunity In the current situation with increased uncertainties in the internal and external environments Tsingtao Brewery has
of 25x for 2025 (previously 28x for 2024) and the target price is lowered from 110 yuan to 88 yuan The rating of outperform the
market is maintained
Risks Slow demand recovery decline in residents consumption power and increase in raw material prices
