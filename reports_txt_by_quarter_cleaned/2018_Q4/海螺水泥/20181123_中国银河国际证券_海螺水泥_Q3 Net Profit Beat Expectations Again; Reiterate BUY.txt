Conch Cement reported a recurring net profit of RMB77bn in Q3 2018 up 149% YoY
Sales volume grew impressively by 226% YoY to 939m tonnes including about 17m
tonnes from the trading platform Blended ASP (cement and clinker) rose from
RMB316tonne in Q2 2018 to RMB328tonne in Q3 2018 Q3 2018 net profit implies our
Q4 2018E net profit is about RMB73bn which looks low since Q4 is usually a peak
season for volume and price Therefore we raise our 2018E2019E EPS by 5%82%
We reiterate our BUY rating but lower our H-share target price from HK65 (27x
2018E PBR) to HK5750 (237x 2018E PBR 1 standard deviation above the average)
to reflect the lower risk appetite of investors after the recent sharp market correction (A-
share target price RMB47 6% discount to our H-share target price based on the aver-
age discount in the past few years)
Investment Highlights
Q3 sales volume grew 226% YoY The Company sold 769m tonnes of cement and
clinker it produced in Q3 Thanks to strong sales volume from its trading platform total
sales volume in Q3 was 939m tonnes up 226% YoY Blended ASP rose from
RMB316tonne in Q2 2018 to RMB328tonne in Q3 2018 which is better than ex-
pected since Q3 is usually a low season due to rainy weather
Gross profit per tonne dropped due to trading business Gross profit per tonne fell
from RMB147 in Q2 2018 to RMB127 in Q3 2018 although the ASP increased QoQ
The decline was distorted by sales volume from the trading platform which accounted
for 18% of total sales volume in Q3 Overall it is still positive leading to 149% growth in
Q3 recurring net profit In addition the trading platform also enhances the pricing power
of the Company in some regions
Q4 outlook remains upbeat Based on the latest price and inventory level information
from Digital Cement cement prices in east and south central China still maintained a
moderate uptrend (Figure 2 and 3) while inventory levels remained low (Figure 4 and
5) which should bode well for Q4 2018 performance
Upward earnings revision Q3 2018 net profit suggests our Q4 2018E net profit is
about RMB73bn (Q3 RMB77bn) which looks low since Q4 is usually a peak season
for volume and price Therefore we lift our 2018E2019E EPS by 5%82% After the
recent correction triggered by overall market weakness Conch Cement-H is trading at
62x 2018E PER with a 72% dividend yield which looks too bearish with a net cash
balance sheet
Q3 Net Profit Beat Expectations Again Reiterate BUY
