(apatinib) Aibeining Aisu and atracurium series All together they took in
66% of total revenue in 1H18 by Rx data  Hengrui maintained its No 1 rank in
many of the chemical classes in the past 45 years Also most of the 10 drugs
experienced single-digit price cuts during the period except for Aitan whose
ASP was slashed 37% in 1H18 upon NRDL entry We now model 21% and
Expect limited impact from BE drug tender 3 drugs involved
We expect limited impact on Hengrui from the drug tender in 11 large cities
Related products include dexmedetomidine irbesartan and nab paclitaxel
which accounted for 11% 1% and 0% of revenue in 1H18 respectively per
Rx data Whether dexmedetomidine can pass BE before this tender remains
uncertain now No matter whether Hengrui wins or loses the tender we
estimate the impact on total revenue would be from -15% to -1% in 11 cities
only while blended impact would be no more than 05% in absolute value
Going forward we believe Hengrui holds a relatively robust franchise with
Model revisions including minor changes to historical data
The largest challenge for modeling Hengrui is the lack of sales data as the
primarily replies upon its direct sales force public data also indicates Hengrui
used third party CSOs (contract sales organizations) which explains the
discrepancy between Rx data and reported revenues on specific therapeutic
classes We took time to reconcile these and believe our present model
properly reflects Rx trends
Decrease price target to RMB739 from RMB855 risks
We decrease our PT mainly due to sector re-rating Our PT is based on 55x
2019E EPS vs 64x previously We believe Hengrui deserves a premium in the
multiple given the superior value of its products and its strong pipeline its A-
share peers are trading at 29x 2019E EPS with 20% growth in 2020 (vs 27%
we model for Hengrui) Key risks include regulatory delays setback in gastric

DB analysis for top 10 drugs
calculation
dosagesformulations We also use 3M rolling average for market share and
ASP data Our key takeaways include the following
Most of the top 10 drugs delivered healthy growth in 1H18 while
Aiheng lagged
Out of top 10 Hengrui has a dominant position for 9 drugs in terms of
market share
Despite the threats of potential new rivals in each generic class for
instance iodixanol sevoflurane and irinotecan we believe Hengrui is
able to manage the risks well supported by strong marketing high-
quality products and abundant pipeline

Deep dive into flagship
Aisu (docetaxel)
Sales growth of Aisu improved to 23% in 1H18 vs 13%1% in
20172016 respectively In our view this is partly related to removal of
restrictions to 2nd line treatment in national reimbursement last year
Aisu was also taking more market share from early 2017 with
relatively small price cut (4% in 1H18)

Aibeining (dexmedetomidine)
Aibeining is the largest drug of Hengrui by our estimate and holds the
majority of dexmedetomidine market in China
According to Rx data this drug accounted for 11% of total revenue in
1H18 and it grew 14% YoY during the period We also highlight the
magnitude of price cut increased to 7% in 1H18 from 2% in 2016

Aitan (apatinib)
According to Rx data Aitan accounted for only 4% of Hengruis total
sales in 1H18 vs 11% by DBe We highlight that the reason behind
the difference is that a large portion of Aitan is sold in drug stores
We continue to expect very strong growth of Aitan in the next few

Additionally atracurium besilate is an exclusive drug of Hengrui
Growth of cisatracurium besylate remained solid while sales of
atracurium besilate shrunk during the period
Hengrui maintained prices quite well and experienced lower price cuts
besilate declined moderately by 5% and 6% YoY respectively in 1H18

Hengruis iodixanol is another key drug in the contrast agents segment
and accounted for 8% of total revenue in 1H18 Rx data indicated that
it had been gaining market share since 2014 and charged at the
lowest national price since 2015
Sales growth of Hengruis iodixanol outperformed most of its flagship
drugs with CAGR14-17 of 62% We remain optimistic on contrast
