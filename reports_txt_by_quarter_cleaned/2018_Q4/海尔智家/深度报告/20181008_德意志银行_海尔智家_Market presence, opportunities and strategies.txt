market we have prepared this report to help investors better understand the
EU growth opportunities and (3) Haiers strategies to grow Smart Home
solutions while improving execution Please note we are restricted on the
Balanced product portfolio and strong brand presence globally
between washing machine refrigerator and air conditioner (Figure 2)
Haier also focuses on branded revenue (minimal contract manufacturing
Figure 3) and has one of the strongest track records in acquiring and
building brands (Figure 4)
Haiers business focus has secured a leading market presence globally
(Figs 7-9 China Figs 22-39 global) with expanding market share We
market share positions in China the US SEA and North Asia
Financially Qingdao Haiers revenue growth profile has been more stable
than those of Midea and Gree (Figure 13) with a strong gross margin Yet
Qingdao Haiers opex-to-sales ratio is materially higher than peers due to
its different business structure (discussed below)
Growth opportunities kitchen and Europe market share expansion
Qingdao Haier plans to expand its share in global kitchen appliances
markets leveraging its premium brands (Casarte and Fisher  Paykel)
traditional white goods Euromonitor estimates Chinas kitchen appliances
market is even bigger than washing machine (Figure 41)
Qingdao Haier has announced a target of attaining a top-five market share
in Europe by 2022 (vs currently ninth place with a 23% share Figure 42)
In our view the EU is a more scattered market than China or the US while
Qingdao Haiers multi-brand strategy will help its expansion
Smart Home strategy and improving execution
By selling a solution in a bundle to consumers (vs previously selling single
items) Qingdao Haier aims to achieve market share gains and improved
consumer loyalty It is crucial to drive consumers return purchases as
replacement demand continues to rise against slowing new home sales
Haier conducts its business through both Qingdao Haier and Haier
Electronics forming a different business structure (Figure 50) Haier has
been aligning the two entities business goals to enhance execution

Qingdao Haier vs local champions
Qingdao Haiers differentiation (1) balanced revenue mix (2) focus on own-
brand revenue and (3) leading multi-brand portfolio
Balanced product portfolio including washing machines refrigerators air
conditioners kitchen appliances etc (although significantly smaller
revenues than Midea which has a much larger air conditioner business
than Qingdao Haier)

Qingdao Haier stacked up well in terms of operating margin vs global peers in
2017 although we note that this was not the case in 2016 Margins across the
peer group generally fell in 2017 YoY likely due to rising raw material costs
while margins for Qingdao Haier improved slightly due to better control of raw
material costs and increased wholesale prices to pass on the additional costs

Identifying Haiers global growth opportunities
Top growth markets (1) SEA and (2) China kitchen appliances
Based on Euromonitors forecasts (Figure 41) we have identified the South
East Asia and China kitchen appliances markets as being the most lucrative
opportunities (decent market scale with strong growth outlook) We also note
that Chinas kitchen appliances market is a very scattered market This could
provide an opportunity for more resourceful new entrants (like Qingdao Haier)
to consolidate the market and take market share Although Chinas air
conditioner market is seen by Euromonitor as a key growth opportunity in the
global white goods industry we do not expect Qingdao Haier to increase its
Haiers lack of scale We expect Qingdao Haier to stay as a niche player
targeting the premium split-type air conditioner markets in China

Haiers ambitions for Europe
EU a more scattered market requiring multi-brand strategy
We attribute Haiers lower market share in Western Europe (Figure 42) to the
market nature  a more scattered market Haier plans to leverage its multi-
brand portfolio to capture opportunities in the scattered market
Goal 2022 market share Qingdao Haier announced a target to garner
top-five market share in Europe by 2022 (vs ninth place currently with
23% share Figure 42) according to its analyst meeting on 31 May
Strategies three key markets
(1) Western Europe Haier plans to upgrade its products especially
refrigerator and washing machine Management believes its new
premium brands (GEA and Fisher  Paykel) alongside improving
the Haier brand image will fulfil these goals
(2) Russia Haier aims to expand domestic production to drive key
segments including high-end refrigerator
(3) Eastern Europe Haier plans to follow the Russia model to boost
domestic production

Chinas cyclical downtrend will eventually ease while US
economy remains robust
China air conditioner cyclical downtrend is our main concern but Qingdao
Haiers exposure is less significant
We expect Chinas air conditioner over-inventory issue to push the industry
into a destocking mode If we use the 2015 downcycle as an example it could
take 12-24 months to clear the excessive channel inventory Having said that
Qingdao Haiers exposure to air conditioner is less significant vs Midea and
Gree (see Key Risk section for discussions on China air conditioner market)
China washing machine and refrigerator growth still driven by ASP
Management indicated sustainable washing machine and refrigerator revenue
growth during the 1H18 earnings call This is driven by ASP upgrades and
better functionality (penetration of washer-drier) Latest revenue growth in
1H18 as well as China Market Monitor data also suggest that Qingdao Haier is
taking washing machine market share in China from Midea  Little Swan using
its Casarte brand
China kitchen appliances the long-term story remains intact
Key players (Robam and Fotile) saw the impact from property market
slowdown However we think this headwind provides an important
opportunity for more resourceful home appliances groups to enter the kitchen
appliances market to take market share In addition based on previous
property cycles we expect the kitchen appliances headwind to ease along with
recovering property transaction growth
US economic growth remains resilient
Qingdao Haier via GEA has more than 20% revenue exposure to the US DB
economists forecast a resilient 29%27% GDP growth in 20182019

Industry impact we worry more about price hikes and reduced demand
Direct impact appears limited The latest tariff list from the US
(announced on September 17 2018) included most of Chinas white
goods except for washing machines (Figure 43) Chinas home
appliances exports to the US are less significant especially air
conditioners (both split type and central type) and washing machines
(Figure 44) We are also less concerned about other countries taking
significant share from Chinas appliances manufacturers due to
Chinas leading scale and market share (Figure 45)

But we worry about increased costs hurting demand China is the
refrigerators Figure 45) and one of the top motor makers As a result
the tariff could increase global home appliances costs Whirlpool
indicated that the tariff could increase the costs of its dishwashers
which are made in Ohio US (Nikkei News dated 18 September 2018)
If home appliances brands increase prices to pass on the additional
costs this might reduce consumer demand
Qingdao Haiers impact current operations intact but synergies hindered
Current operation intact Qingdao Haiers global factories (especially
those held by GEA) will help hedge it from the China-US trade
disputes We estimate Qingdao Haiers exports from China to the US
account for less than 5% of its revenue
Co-procurement and production synergy affected however the
additional tariff could affect Qingdao Haiers plan to shift GEAs
manufacturing and raw material procurement back to China Our
calculation suggests a 10% tariff (the proposed tariff by the US
government to-be increased to 25% starting 1 January 2019) could
increase GEAs costs by more than RMB2bn (if shifting production in
China and export to the US) more than offsetting the guided cost
saving (by management) of RMB1bn
Suspending plans to introduce GEA in China Qingdao Haier has
reportedly announced that it will no longer sell made-in-US GEA
products in China (Financial Times dated 20 September 2018) We
note that the original plan was to introduce GEAs premium collection
(especially kitchen appliances) in China As a result we now expect

Smart Home strategy and
Smart Home  selling bundled solutions
Benefits of selling a solution (1) market share gain and (2) consumer
As replacement demand continues to outpace new purchases (in
China) home appliances players shift their focus from selling
appliances to selling bundled solutions For example this could
include water heater  purifier andor air conditioners with sensors to
detect movements
Such bundle sales benefits brands market share and more
importantly enables more return purchases by consumers

Haiers advantage to drive Smart Home product and brand portfolio
Haiers leadership in refrigerator and washing machine on top of innovative
product offerings in air conditioner (self-cleaning) and kitchen appliances

Execution turnaround aligning Qingdao Haier and Haier
Electronics business goals
Qingdao Haier and Haier Electronics a different business structure
Haier Electronics (56%-owned by Qingdao Haier) is closely embedded
into Qingdao Haiers business to operate manufacturing logistics and
distribution
Haiers business structure is very different from those of Midea and
Gree (Figure 50  Figure 51)
Currently Haier Electronics main responsibilities are related to
distribution and logistics (on top of washing machine and water heater
manufacturing)
As a result we witnessed frequent related party transactions between
(Figure 49)
(1) On the procurement side Qingdao Haiers financial report records
significant related party procurement from the private parent
(2) On the sales side the recorded related party transactions are limited
We believe some of Qingdao Haiers related sales with Haier
Electronics are not recorded in the financial statement as Qingdao
Haier consolidates Haier Electronics so the transactions between the
two entities will be eliminated

We project 10% revenue CAGR in 2018 and 2019E driven by
(1) A high-single-digit ASP increase for key segments including refrigerator
washing machine and air conditioners Note most of the ASP increases
stem from mix upgrades (washing machine rising drum-type and washer-
penetration
refrigerator
French-door
refrigerators air conditioner increased presence of Haiers proprietary
self-cleaning technology)
(2) High-single-digit volume growth for washing machine and refrigerator
reflecting the increased market share from Casarte
(3)  Note that we are more conservative on kitchen appliances revenue
growth in 2018 this is to reflect the drag from the slowdown in Chinas
property market (note we use DB China property teams official forecasts
which estimate a 5% yoy decline in Chinas new housing GFA in 2018)
However we expect kitchen appliances growth rates to recover in 2019E
(4) FX assumptions the majority of Qingdao Haiers revenue is from China (in
the US and is denominated in USD We use DBs house view on FX rates
in our model As suggested by Figure 60 we expect recent RMBUSD
moves to be positive for Qingdao Haiers revenue
Figure 52 Qingdao Haier DB revenue estimates by region
We project 17% EBIT CAGR in 2018 and 2019E driven by
(1) Improved gross margin by 13ppt and 01ppt yoy in 2018 and 2019 This is
driven by better business mix margin improvements at key business
segments (due to product upgrades) and easing raw material cost
(2) Cost analysis we expect Qingdao Haiers cost pressure to improve as the
price of key raw materials stabilise (Figure 63 to Figure 66)

(3) We forecast EBIT margin to be driven by gross margin expansion We
expect Qingdao Haier to control its opex-to-revenue ratio due to better
operating efficiency
We project 17% earnings CAGR in 2018 and 2019E driven by EBIT growth
We expect Qingdao Haiers earnings growth to be similar vs EBIT growth
While Midea and Gree have stronger earnings growth we attribute part of
(see reports on Midea link and Gree link) We note that the lending business
could increase investors risk exposure to the air conditioners downcycle
Note that most of the minority interest is from Qingdao Haiers un-owned

In our base case model we assume RMB500m of synergy from GEA cost
savings (producing GEA products in China) in 2019 As discussed in page 12
the modelled synergy could face downside risks
Healthy working capital conditions
We expect Qingdao Haier to continue leveraging its strong bargaining power
to drive accounts payable days We forecast the bargaining power to be
strengthened with Qingdao Haiers improved scale after it integrates the
sourcing of GEA and Fisher  Paykel
Overseas debt and managements efforts to refinance
We believe that Qingdao Haier has incurred overseas debt during the
acquisition of GEA (this is our estimate based on managements public
guidance on the transaction) During the acquisition management indicated
that 60% of the USD54bn consideration would be financed by bank loans To
refinance the borrowing Qingdao Haier announced (on 7 November 2017) it
would issue a HKD8bn convertible bond We forecast Qingdao Haier to further
improve its financial leverage As of 1H18 Qingdao Haier disclosed over
USD3bn of debt in USD representing 60% of the USD54bn acquisition
consideration in our view Such USD-denominated debt accounts for 66% of
Qingdao Haiers total debt based on our calculation
