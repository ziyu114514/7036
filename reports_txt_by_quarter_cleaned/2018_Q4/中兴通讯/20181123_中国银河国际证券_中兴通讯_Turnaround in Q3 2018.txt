ZTE Corporation 0763HK000063CH
ZTE Corporation (ZTE) posted a net profit of RMB5645m in Q3 2018 which is at mid point of the
previous guidance range ZTE guided a net loss of RMB62bn-72bn for 2018 which implies a net
profit of RMB64m-RMB10bn for Q4 2018 We acknowledge that the recovery is somewhat slower
than expected but the Company is still on the track to recover from the impact of the US export ban
We believe that ZTE will be one of the major beneficiaries of 5G investment in China We still be-
tors and government and corporate business But the consumer products segment is expected to
after the Q3 2018 results announcement given the slower-than-expected recovery But we still be-
lieve infrastructure-related segments such as 5G will be the main investment themes in 2019 and
ZTE is a major name in the infrastructure-related hardware providers listed in HK and China We still
believe that market confidence in ZTE will be restored Apart from the recovery in operating perfor-
mance news flow on 5G development in China is a major share price catalyst for ZTE We maintain
our BUY rating with a target price of HK1867 based on 14x 2019E PER lower than the Compa-
nys historical mean of 22x Our target price for ZTE-A (000063CH) is RMB2155 and we upgrade
our rating from HOLD to BUY on ZTE-A
Investment Highlights
Q3 2018 Back to profitability ZTEs turnover dropped 143% YoY from RMB22569m in Q3
2017 to RMB19332m in Q3 2018 The YoY decline in turnover in Q3 2018 was less than the
27% YoY drop in 1H 2018 The Q3 2018 turnover figures were still distorted by the US export
ban The Company reported a net profit of RMB5645m in Q3 2018 at the mid-point of previ-
ous guidance This represents a 504% YoY drop from RMB11384m in Q3 2017 but a turna-
round from a net loss of RMB78242m in 1H 2018 ZTEs blended gross profit margin im-
proved to 365% in Q3 2018 a multi-year high in our view due to a higher contribution from
the carrier network segment which has a higher gross profit margin ZTEs Q3 results were
also impacted by some one-off items such as RMB200m in legal costs impairment of credits 
assets and a RMB251m mark-to-market loss on investments ZTEs core operating perfor-
mance is solid excluding the impact of these one-off items Higher RD expenses in our view
are another reason for slower recovery progress RD expenses were RMB34652m in Q3
2018 vs RMB50606m in 1H 2018 However we believe that RD expenses invested now will
which guided a net loss of RMB62bn-72bn This implies net profit will be in range of RMB60m
to RMB1bn We still expect ZTE to report a QoQ increase in net profit in Q4 2018 as the Com-
pany is on the right track to recovery
Local market potential to drive recovery We share the view that the market might have
concerns about the growth outlook for ZTE given potential market share loss in overseas mar-
kets in both the equipment and consumer products segments We believe the consumer prod-
ucts segment will lag behind but equipment and non-operator business should drive the recov-
ery in Q4 2018 and 2019 especially given 5G development in China Since 5G is an area sup-
ported by the Chinese government it will create growth potential for equipment makers such as
ZTE In addition to wireless equipment ZTE has invested in new technologies which will allow
the Company to benefit from the adoption of new technologies like NB-IoT
Downward earnings adjustment for 2018 We revised down our net profit forecast for 2018
after ZTEs Q3 2018 results announcement We keep our 2019 net profit forecasts as we be-
Q3 2018 results announcement which in our view offers a good buying opportunity especially
since infrastructure-related themes will be the focus in the hardware segment in 2019  2020
