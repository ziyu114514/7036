MIDEA GROUP 000333CH Monitor arbitrage opportunity
We believe Mideas chances of a successful privatisation of Little Swan have
increased since it updated its offer terms on Nov 21 Midea will exchange 11158
and 09056 new shares for each Little Swan A and B share respectively after
an RMB40 dividend by Little Swan This implies that the offer price for Little
Swan A is RMB4825 a 3% premium to yesterdays close While Little Swans
privatisation may result in a small EPS dilution this will be offset by the long-
term benefits stemming from a more efficient corporate structure We maintain
opportunity Meanwhile the new offer structure suggests that each Little Swan-B
share is worth about HK45 or a 9% premium to yesterdays close of
Investment Highlights
Approval process continues According to the Nov 21 announcement Little
Swan and Midea have approval from their respective boards for the transaction
On Dec 21 Little Swan and Midea will each hold a shareholders meeting to vote
the CSRC before the deal can be closed though this last step is widely
understood to be a formality Ultimately if the deal is successful the transaction
is expected to close after the Spring Festival
acquire the remaining 47% of Little Swan by offering 1211 new shares for each
Little Swan A share and 10007 new shares for each Little Swan B share This
has effectively been revised to 11158 and 09056 shares for Little Swan A and
B shares respectively with Little Swan issuing a special dividend of RMB 40
per share if the transaction is successful
Midea to benefit in the long run The deal itself may result in 2% EPS dilution
in 2019 (a 5% increase in the number of shares offset by a 3% increase in net
profit) In the longer term Midea will see efficiency gains as a result of fewer
related-party transactions reduced resource duplication and less internal
New offer sweetens the deal for Little Swan shareholders This new offer
structure implies that each Little Swan-A share is worth RMB4825 or a 3%
premium to yesterdays close of RMB4683 We believe investors should monitor
this pricing difference to capture arbitrage opportunities Meanwhile the new
offer structure suggests that each Little Swan-B share is worth about HK45 or
yesterdays
