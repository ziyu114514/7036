MIDEA GROUP 000333CH 3Q 18 Conference call takeaways
Midea reported 3Q18 results with topbottom line growing 1%18% respectively
for the quarter vs 10%19% for 9M18 With revenue growth facing macro
headwinds and ASP growth (consumer upgrade) stalling in the AC segment we
think the stock is likely to remain under pressure We have cut our 20182019
EPS by 3%17% respectively and reduce our PT from RMB 53 to RMB 42
Investment Highlights
revenue rose 1% YoY with net profit growing 18% YoY on account of gross
margin expansion and reduced finance expense Mideas 3Q18 top line fell short
of our expectation for mid-single digit revenue growth in second half PBT growth
of 245% for the quarter was supported by improvements in finance costs
Underlying operating profit grew only 9% (See Figure 1)
Upgrade trend slowing in AC Mideas gross margins increased to 281% up
from 259% a year ago Mgmt indicated AC growth of 18% YoY in 9M18
suggesting negative growth for AC in 3Q18 based on 28% AC growth in 1H18
ASP increase was flat for 3Q18 vs 10% growth in 1H18 This remains a key
concern as consumer upgrade and margin expansion has been part of our
Midea thesis
Low channel inventory Mideas AC inventory remains well controlled with 1-2
million units In other appliance segments Midea also reports that channel
inventory is near historical lows While we believe there is a high probability of
revenue weakness into 4Q18 we dont believe Mideas AC industry channel
inventory levels are reminiscent of 2015 levels when destocking led to a
sustained sales contraction
Inexpensive Valuation With 35% sales from international sources (ex KUKA)
and lower ASPs relative to Gree and Qingdao Haier Midea remains well
situated to ride out a slowdown in Chinas home appliance market Currently
trading at 111x 2019E PER we expect Midea to post 21%0% EPS growth in
20182019 down from our former estimates of 21%11% EPS growth Our
20182019 earnings have been reduced by 35%172% respectively Our new
TP is based on a valuation of 13x 2019 EPS down from our former 15x which
we believe is justifiable for a business with a diversified franchise stable market
share and high single digit earnings growth

Target Price Reduction
We keep our prior margin assumptions but reduce top line growth for 20182019 Under our new
assumptions revenue growth declines from 11%6% in 20182019 to 9%1% respectively Our 20182019
revenue estimates are 3%11% lower than consensus while our 20182019 profit expectations are 2%
higher11% lower than consensus
We cut our price target from RMB 53 to RMB 42 on account of lower earnings growth and assign a new 13x
2019 PER multiple to the stock vs our 15x multiple used in our prior number Using our previous 15x 2019
PER valuation our current target price would be RMB 48

Takeaways from Mideas Management Call
Guidance Midea continues to guide for high single digit top line and double digit profit growth into 2019
AC Growth Negative 3Q18 growth flat ASPs Mgmt indicated AC growth of 18% YoY in 9M18
Based on reported AC growth of 32% in 1H18 this suggests negative growth for AC in 3Q18 According
to management ASP increase was flat for 3Q18 vs 10% growth in 1H18 This remains a key concern
as consumer upgrade and margin expansion has been part of our Midea thesis Midea indicated that
installation growth was negative in October
AC Inventory Tight AC Channel inventory remains tightly controlled with 5Mn units or roughly 2-25
15Mn units in channel inventory nearly 5 months of its annual production on our estimates Midea
emphasized it holds 100 warehouses in China which ship AC units directly to retailers Midea spends
RMB 800m annually on this inventory and warehousing management system which tracks inventory
levels daily
Gree channel stuffing unlikely to impact Midea Management assuaged investor concern that any AC
channel stuffing from Gree would impact Midea In the last AC segment downturn in 20152016 Midea
had not yet developed its own inventory management system As a result Mideas channel inventory was
high and sell-in suffered during the market downturn Today Mideas inventory levels are very well
controlled
Refrigerators grew 2% in Q3 against 8% for 9M18 Even with revenue slowing refrigerator ASP
growth remains resilient with average ASP increasing 15% YoY
Washing machines grew 9% in 9M18 but declined 1% in 3Q18 Performance should improve in 4Q18
as new high end models are introduced  Little Swan acquisition unlikely to close until 2019 due to
required shareholder vote occurring in December
Small appliances up 5% in 9M18 but up 2% in 3Q18 Small appliance inventory was high in 1H18 but
inventories are now normalizing Longer term high single digit growth should remain achievable
KUKA cut 2018 guidance from EUR 35Bn to EUR 33Bn due to a weak global robotics market Impact
were somewhat encouraging however as revenue growth turned to 66% growth an improvement from
1H18s -112% Due to RMB depreciation against the Euro the negative impact is somewhat mitigated on
Mideas financials
Mideas new high end brand Como will have products in stores by December
