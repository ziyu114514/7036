Gree 000651CH Strong performance may not be sustainable
Gree reported a strong set of 3Q18 results with revenue and EPS growing 382%
and 38% YoY respectively led by strong results in air conditioning While the results
were solid investor concern is focused on the sustainability of the strong
performance as rising channel inventory levels may account for a significant portion
had reported deteriorating China AC sales in 3Q18 Excess inventory could weigh on
2019 sales and profitability thus impeding share price performance We reduce our
target price from RMB43 to RMB40
Investment Highlights
Strong 3Q18 growth but concerns about channel inventory Gree indicated that
channel inventory is at least 15 million units which we estimate accounts for 5
million units of channel inventory or 2-25 months of annual production by our
estimates Unlike Midea Gree does not warehouse inventory for its distributors
which provides the Company with less clarity over channel inventory levels
Gree anticipates continued strength in 4Q18 Gree indicated that it expects 4Q18
growth to be roughly in line with that of Q3 but that the AC segment is difficult to
predict For 2019 Gree believes double-digit revenue growth should be achievable
We remain concerned that continued strong sales in a weak market may result in
increased channel inventory levels which may hamper growth in 2019
Continued dividend uncertainty Gree announced a proposed interim dividend of
36Bn or RMB06 per share indicating a 30% payout ratio for 1H18 This was less
than our and market expectations of 50% payout and below Grees historical
payout ratio of 60-70% Gree has not provided clear guidance on whether it intends
to continue this payout ratio for 2H18 earnings Nor has Gree provided further clarity
on where it intends to invest its cash reserves
Inexpensive valuation In spite of a strong 9M18 top line we remain cautious about
Grees future growth in light of increasing channel inventory the lack of new
discernible long-term growth drivers and an inconsistent corporate strategy Gree
derives 88% of its revenue from China making its earnings almost wholly reliant on
the domestic China market On this basis we believe Gree warrants a discount
relative to its peers Haier and Midea We raise our 2018 EPS estimates by 43% on
the back of strong 3Q18 but cut our 2019 EPS estimates by 5% Our 20182019
EPS estimates are 8%14% below consensus We value the Company at 95x 2019E
