Third-largest battery player in China but
yet to catch up in NMC Hold
New capacity on the way but yet to see meaningful shipments of NMC battery
Guoxuan High-Tech the third-largest battery player in China aims to double its
the LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery and it is now trying to ramp up the NMC
(lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide) battery business However meaningful
progress is yet to be seen in the NMC battery with Guoxuan having only 04%
NMC market share by 9M18 We set our target price at 15x 2019E PE in line with
the industry average With 9% upside potential we maintain our Hold view on
Guoxuan This report marks the transfer of coverage from James Kan to Sharon
Weak 3Q due to lower shipments keep an eye on NMC battery
Guoxuan recorded RMB41bn revenue in 9M2018 achieving only 59% of our
estimate as a result of weak shipments due to the subsidy cut in the middle
of this year Gross margin in the rst nine months also missed our expectation
by 2ppt a result of ASP pressure and lower volume In terms of NMC battery
management mentioned there is no technical or customer issue but it is awaiting
success in LFP battery
Cutting target price to RMB133 and maintaining Hold risks
meaningful shipments in NMC battery We lower our 2018 and 2019 earnings
estimates by 12% and 10% respectively to factor in its weaker-than-expected
shipments and ASP pressure Our target price of RMB133 (down from RMB1558)
is based on a target multiple of 15x 2019E PE in line with the battery industry
average the lower TP reects a shift from a 154x multiple and our lower
estimates We maintain our Hold rating Risks include faster or slower capacity
ramp-up and shipments

that installation market share is only part of the story because some of the

Guoxuan is the third-largest EV lithium battery player in China with c5%
EV lithium battery market share in terms of installation by 3Q18 We believe
help it to grow market share and make it one of the beneciaries of the Chinese
governments target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020 However
battery unit pricing decline and EV subsidy policy change may put pressure on
its margin outlook In addition we are yet to see Guoxuan have meaningful entry
into the NMC market Hold
As Guoxuan has listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO in 2015 we
believe its historical PE band may not reect its future outlook We adopt a 2019E
trajectory and is in line with battery manufacturers average
Key industry updownside risks 1) signicant changes in the Chinese
governments EV subsidy policy 2) weakerstronger-than-expected volume
growth in the next three years 3) quickerslower-than-expected ASP drop or
quickerslower-than-expected cost cuts

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
