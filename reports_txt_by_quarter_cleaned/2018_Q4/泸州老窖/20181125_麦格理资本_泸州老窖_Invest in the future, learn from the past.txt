Rmb30bn in 2020E (Rmb104bn in 2017) National Cellar 1573 mid-range
products and health and other innovative liquors are each expected to make a
one-third contribution to revenue
Amid the recovery of the baijiu industry and consumption upgrade trend the
sales percentage of its high-end products leapfrogged to 52% in 1H18 from
22% in 2015 According to industry experts 1573 won back its historical
market share in 2017 and gained more in 2018 As a result GPM rose to
739% in 1H18 from 494% in 2015 Meanwhile the ex-factory price of 1573
was lifted twice in 2017 by 6% and 9% in March and July respectively The

expenses ratio continued to increase 24ppt YoY to 225% in 9M18 higher
than 54% of Moutai and 105% of Wuliangye However gross margin
expansion driven by product mix upgrade more than offset the increase in
SGA and operating margin improved 32ppt YoY to 407% Moreover post
the hiccup in the baijiu industry and ineffectual pricing strategy Laojiao rebuilt
lessons and is managing channel inventory under 2 months currently
