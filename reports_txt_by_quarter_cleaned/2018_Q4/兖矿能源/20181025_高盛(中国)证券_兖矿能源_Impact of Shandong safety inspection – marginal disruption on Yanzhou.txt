On October 20 a major coal mine accident took place at Shandong Longyun Coal
mine (not a Yanzhou asset) due to a rock burst (a spontaneous violent fracture of
rock that can occur in deep mines) As a result an emergency notice by the
Shandong Coal mine safety supervision department was issued imposing a special
safety inspection on 41 coal mines located in Shandong which are subject to similar
risk of a potential rock burst The inspections will last one week during which time
both the China Coal Association and Yanzhou Coal Specically three of Yanzhous
coal mines located in the Shandong region were included on the inspection list
which we estimate represent total annual capacity of 156mnt or 44% of Yanzhou
week of production suspension the disruption would lead to a 03mnt output cut or
032% of Yanzhous full-year 2018E output and 03% of the earnings impact on
2018E in our estimates
At the industry level a one-week disruption at the 41 coal mines subject to
inspection could lead to a 3mnt cut to output (based on estimates from the China
Coal Association) or 008% of Chinas coal output thus the impact to the market
would also be limited in our view
The three Yanzhou coal mines affected are (1) Dongtan Mine (东滩)  75mnt annual
capacity thermal coal (2) Jining No2 Mine (济宁二号)  42mnt annual capacity of
thermal coal (3) Zhaolou (赵楼) with 39mnt capacity of semi-coking coal We
estimate the three coal mines account for 158% of total gross prot based on their
specic type of coal product and average HQ production cost We estimate a
one-week suspension would lead to a 03mnt impact on output or a 19% impact on
their contribution to total prot  leading to a 03% impact on total prot all else
We  maintain our BUY rating on both Yanzhou Coal Mining HA shares Our 12-month
target price for Yanzhou-H remains at HK120 and for Yanzhou-A remains Rmb146
and our TP methodology is unchanged based on historical PB vs ROE correlation 
or 2019E PB of 082X119X at an ROE of 151%

Key risks include 1) Coal prices in both the domestic China and international seaborne
markets which are affected by both the supply-demand balance in the Chinese and
international markets demand for coal is mostly driven by the power steel and building
materials sectors transportation capacity for coal including both rail and ports is also a
key factor affecting coal prices 2) the Chinese governments export policy on coal
including export VAT rebate changes export tax changes and import tariff and 3)
additional unexpected cost imposed on coal producers by the government especially
relating to environmental concerns and resources

GS Factor Prole
Returns and Multiple) Growth Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for specic metrics for each stock The
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute The precise calculation of each metric may
vary depending on the scal year industry and region but the standard approach is as follows
Growth is based on a stocks forward-looking sales growth EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for nancial stocks only EPS and sales growth) with a
pricedividend (PD) EVEBITDA EVFCF and EVDebt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for nancial stocks only PE PB and PD) with a higher percentile
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile Financial Returns
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile)
Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the scal year-end at least three quarters in the future Growth uses inputs
