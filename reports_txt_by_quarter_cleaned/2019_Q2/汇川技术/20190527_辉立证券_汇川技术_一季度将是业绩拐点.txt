匯川技術 (300124CH)
中國  汽車零部件  更新報告
匯川技術2018 年實現歸屬上市公司股東的淨利潤1167 億元，同比增長101%，每股
收益070 元，每股派息02 元。業績低于我們預期，主要因爲1）去年第四季度國內
宏觀經濟下行影響下游需求，2）新能源客車市場于報告期內依舊受政策調整影響，持
續時間長于預期。但憑藉公司在衆多細分行業取得的競爭優勢，和前期的軌交訂單交
付，公司總體收入仍取得較快增長，全年營業收入爲5874 億元，同比增長23%。
分業務看，通用板塊實現收入2587 億元，同比增長32%；電梯業務實現收入137 億
元，同比增長2234%；電液伺服實現收入495 億元，同比增長3%；新能源汽車業務
實現收入841 億元，同比下降8%；軌道交通實現收入212 億元，同比增長112%。
2018 年公司整體毛利率爲4181%，同比下降331 個百分點，主要系2018 年公司産品
收入結構變化、行業競爭加劇等（1）主要客戶宇通客車降價，導致新能源板塊毛利
率下降1056 個百分點；（2）電梯業務銷售結構有所下滑，自動化業務市場競爭加
劇，毛利率略有下滑。
公司成本管控較好，期間費用率2546%（同比節省096 個百分點），其中研發費用占
比爲1212%（同比减少028 百分點），仍維持較高研發支出水平。截至2018 年底，
公司累計完成了八家國內車企的項目定點，2019 年隨著定點車型逐步放量，公司乘用
車電機電控業務將開始步入高增長期。
2019 年公司首季實現營業收入1100 億元，同比增加128%，歸母淨利潤129 億元，
同比大幅减少343%。2019 首季業績出現下挫，主要因爲：1，收入結構下滑與行業競
爭加劇令毛利率同比降413 個百分點，2，收到的增值稅軟件退稅金額减少，導致其
他收益同比下滑4677%，3，報告期內人員增加幷實施了股權激勵導致費用上升，4，
匯率波動導致對前海晶瑞投資損失增加。不過，一季度經營性現金流好轉，由去年同
期的流出094 億轉爲流入021 億。
分業務看，通用自動化業務實現銷售收入503 億元，同比增長52%；電梯一體化業務
實現銷售收入241 億元，同比增長1235%；電液伺服業務伊士通業務實現收入106
億元，同比下降1459%；新能源汽車實現收入075 億元，同比下降88%；軌交業務
實現收入083 億元，同比增長655%；工業機器人實現收入021 億元，同比增長
公司近期公告，擬以現金股權方式收購貝思特100%股權，交易總金額爲2487 億
元，對應PSPEPB 分別爲103、1057、457 倍。貝思特是面向海外的優質電梯零部件
供應商，貝思特的人機界面交互系統、電綫電纜系統等産品在國際品牌電梯廠商市場
中處于領先地位，其與包括奧的斯、通力、蒂森克虜伯、迅達、富士達等絕大多數國
際知名電梯廠商均有穩定合作關係，且已進入其中部分廠商的全球供應商體系。匯川
技術與貝思特在客戶、産品方面形成互補，協同作用明顯，此次通過貝思特打開海外
市場，將進一步擴大海外業務規模，拓展業務發展空間。
