SUMMARY We have met with LONGis management recently to discuss the
Company and solar sector outlook in FY1920E Overall we are optimistic on
LONGis expansion strategy backed by 1) stably increasing mono-PERC product
demand from the overseas market 2) cost leadership led by advanced mono-Si
China market which will likely boost ASP in 2H19E
 Worlds largest mono-crystalline product manufacturer LONGi has more
than 19 years experience specialized in producing mono-Si solar wafer cells
and high-efficient modules The Company is now the largest mono-crystalline
product supplier in the world Mgmt believed mono-PERC product is the most
suitable high-efficient PV product offering high photoelectric conversion
potential in the grid-parity era By 1Q19 LONGi mono-cell products offered
up to 22% efficiency during mass production leading PV peers in China
 Technology advancement and cost leadership build the key edges
LONGi was the first to achieve a breakthrough adopting diamond wire saw
cutting for mono-Si rod Together with unique mono-Si growing technologies
supported by localized equipment LONGi had successfully built up cost
leadership in mono-wafer production which kicked off a trend in replacing
multi-wafer and meeting high-efficient PV module demand since 2017 LONGi
recorded 1Q19 GPM of 235% and mgmt expected GPM to further improve
with lower Poly-Si costs and cost reduction measures in 2Q19E
 Market potential and expansion strategies LONGi placed key module sales
focus on the overseas market in view of short-term policy uncertainties in
China Mgmt expected global PV installation to reach 120GW in 2019 and
shared optimistic market outlook in Europe after EU ends anti-dumping and
anti-subsidy measures To capture future growth LONGi targets to expand
mono-wafer capacity to 65GW by end-2021 representing FY18-21E capacity
CAGR of 324%
 Valuation is still attractive on long term growth prospects Trading at
211x166x FY1920E PE LONGi has no significant valuation premium
expansion with profitable margin we believe there is still upside on both
earnings and valuation
