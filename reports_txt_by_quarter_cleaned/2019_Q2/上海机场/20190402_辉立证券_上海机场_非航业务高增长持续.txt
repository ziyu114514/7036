上海機場2018 年營業收入9313 億元，同增155%；歸母淨利潤423 億元，同增
145%，基本每股收益22 元，略低于我們預期77%左右。每股派息066，派息率保持
30%。加權淨資産收益率提高032 個百分點至1585%。
2018 年上海機場的流量受到控制，航空性業務量僅錄得中低個位數增幅（起降架次
36%，旅客輸送量56%）。但受益于內航內綫提價效應，國際綫占比持續提升和寬
體機比重擴大，航空業務收入增長快于業務量增長，航空性業務收入同比增長658%
至3969 億元，基本維持一個穩健的增長。
不同于受到限制的航空性業務，公司的非航業務錄得持續的高速成長，去年非航業務
收入同比大幅增長232%至534 億元。其中商業租金收入同比大升33%，至3986
億，主要受益于消費意願更强的國際綫旅客占比提升，以及公司持續對商業零售品牌
管理、場地優化和調整等。商業租金中，超過35 億來自于免稅店業務，總量和客單價
（300 元人）均錄得高速增長，同比增速達到約40%和20%，反映浦東機場免稅店正
日益成爲國際綫旅客的購物熱點。
除運行成本外，公司的成本均控制較好。期內總成本457 億元，同比增長9%。其中
運行成本增速較快，同比增286%至191 億元、人力成本增75%，但除該兩項外，其
他營業成本同比下降141%，主要因固定資産折舊年限到期，以及本期無債券利息支
出。運營成本的增長與免稅店業務擴大導致的委托管理費提升和一次性的維修費用增
2018 年9 月上海機場與日上免稅行簽定了新的免稅合同，2019 年-2025 年7 年的保底
提成410 億元，扣點率425%，免稅面積由6600 平方米提升至16915 平方米，大幅增
長156%。我們認爲，出境游帶動的消費升級浪潮下，免稅業務將打開公司非航業務的
發展空間，不僅爲公司下一輪成長提供堅實的基礎，而且有望開啓新的商業運營模
式，充分釋放公司作爲龍頭樞紐機場的估值溢價。
基于强勁的非航業務收入增長預期，我們調整上海機場2019 年的每股EBITDA，同時
引入2020 年預測值，提高目標價爲人民幣67 元，分別對應173168 倍估值倍數，維
持增持評級。(現價截至3 月29 日)
