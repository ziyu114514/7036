Annual Investor Day Takeaways
 We maintain our TP of 48 and HOLD rating on Midea
Mideas annual investor conference was as usual well attended
with over 400 attendees The major takeaways are
Margins likely to remain stable
Mideas gross margin expanded by 24ppt YoY in 1Q19 half of which came from forex
translation gains and half of which came from lower raw material prices Domestic market
gross margin increased less than 1% suggesting its upgrade strategy has yet to yield
meaningful results Without meaningful margin improvement Mideas earnings growth in
2019-2020E earnings growth remain lackluster
In October 2018 Midea added the COLMO brand to its higher end product portfolio
joining Beverly Toshiba and Little Swan In April 2019 Midea launched lower end BUGU
brand to tap into lower end market and solidify their younger customer base However
we estimate limited earnings impact in 2-3 years as Mideas new premium brand will
likely need time to gain market traction (ie Haier Casarte)
No major MA indicated in the foreseeable future
Although Midea held RMB 98Bn cash as of year-end 2018 (RMB 28Bn cash  RMB
70Bn Structured Products) Midea is not looking to take on any major acquisitions within
the next 2-3 years Management is focused on managing its recent KUKA and Toshiba
acquisitions and remains cautious about taking on new ventures Midea earns an
estimated 4% return on its structured deposits
Maintain HOLD until near term catalysts emerge
We still like Mideas long term consumption upgrade story However in absence of any
near term catalyst we retain our TP and Hold rating
