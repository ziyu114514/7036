Signs of Improvement in 1H19
 Midea management is guiding high single-digit growth for 1Q19 higher than our
previous expectation of flat to low single-digit growth
 KUKAs revenue (10% sales) outlook is improving after a disappointing 2018
 High inventory levels in the AC category (40% sales) remain a concern for 2019
 In spite of Mideas improving near-term outlook Mideas shares are currently sitting
near historical highs on a PER basis We expect EPS growth to decelerate in 2019
2020 and think the current valuations look stretched We value Midea at 13x 2020
PER and upgrade our TP from RMB46 to RMB48 after adjusting our forecast
2018 results in line 2H18 gross margins a surprise to the upside
In 2018 Midea recorded revenue of RMB2618b representing 82% YoY growth Net
profit grew 171% YoY to RMB202b in line with consensus Revenue growth was
substantially weighted toward H1 with H2 growth flat YoY (see Figure 1) In spite of
slowing revenue growth gross margins firmed in 2H18 In particular gross margins in the
consumer appliances segment improved 345bps HoH driving the majority of profit
growth in H2
Management upbeat on 1Q19 growth
Management is confident that the Company outperformed its peers in sales growth for
1Q19 Management guided high single-digit top-line growth in 1Q19 and mid-to-high top-
line growth for full-year 2019 Bottom-line growth is expected to outpace revenue
performance An improving growth story in 1Q19 is consistent with data from China
Market Monitor which shows an uptick in home appliances sales in March (see Figures
KUKA (10% sales) a potential bright spot for 2019
KUKAs revenue declined 5% YoY in RMB terms (-68% in euros) mainly due to a
slowdown in global auto sales KUKA management cut revenue guidance twice in 2018
Management is more upbeat about KUKAs 2019 outlook with 1H19 orders expected to
AC inventory levels (40% of sales) remain a concern
Mideas AC inventory levels remain a healthy 4m units (down from 5m units in 3Q18)
However total channel inventory for the sector across all brands may be approaching
levels last seen in 2014 prior to the previous market downturn in ACs Considering high
channel AC inventory and a high base effect in 1H19 we remain cautious on the
categorys 2019 growth outlook
Target price updated to RMB48
We adjust our forecast to account for better-than-expected 1H19 revenue growth and
improving margins in the Consumer Appliances segment (see Figure 10) and continue to
value Midea at 13x 2020 PER We increase our TP from RMB46 to RMB48 on account of
these changes In a scenario where new consumption policy rolls out nationally
increasing appliance sales by RMB700bn in 2019-2021 we think Midea is potentially
worth RMB 52 per share in line with current price level While we continue to like Midea
for its long-term product upgrade story and exposure to international markets we feel
that the recent market rally has run ahead of slowing fundamentals Midea currently
trades at 147x consensus figures on a 1-year rolling forward basis near the top of its
historical range (see Figure 8) However we forecast an EPS CAGR of 10% through
2020 slower than Mideas historical high-teens EPS growth

Key Performance Observations
Mideas revenue growth decelerated in 2H18 but management expects revenue to return to positive territory in
limiting its impact
In 2018 AC accounted for 50% of growth in Mideas gross profit With a high base in 1H19 and high reported
channel inventory levels across the sector we think the AC segment is unlikely to repeat this performance in 2019
Mideas gross margins improved in every major category in 2018 Notably gross margins for Consumer Appliances
improved 345bps in 2H18 we expect them to settle at 29% in 20192020

2018 results briefing takeaways
2019 Outlook
Management is confident that the Company outperformed its peers in sales
growth in 1Q19 Management guided high single-digit top-line growth for 1Q19
and mid-to-high top-line growth for full year 2019 with bottom-line growth
expected to outpace revenue performance
Midea is currently executing some sales promotions before summer but not on
a broad strategic level Management asserts that consumption upgrading is still
the main trend so profit growth should exceed revenue growth in 2019 While
affected by these changes
KUKAs results and management reshuffle
As a result of the broad economic slowdown especially the slowdown in auto
sales in 2018 KUKA adjusted its revenue guidance twice last year However
KUKA targets high growth in 1H19 with more than EUR 2bn worth of orders on
hand YTD Therefore Midea estimates that KUKAs 1H19 order amount will be
revenue growth in 2019 driven mainly by new available capacity in Shunde
Management believes the logistics healthcare and automation business will
make a further contribution to KUKAs revenue growth in China
KUKAs China team is now fully responsible for its operations in China
Previously German headquarters made all the strategic decisions for China but
now operations have been optimized by delegating decision-making authority to
