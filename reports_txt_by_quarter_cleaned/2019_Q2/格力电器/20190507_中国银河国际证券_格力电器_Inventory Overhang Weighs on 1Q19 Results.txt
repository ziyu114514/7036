Inventory Overhang Weighs on 1Q19 Results
 1Q19 revenue slowed to 25% YoY vs 32% growth in 4Q18 The slowdown was due
to high channel inventory levels and seasonality
 Investments in new ventures are beginning to impact Grees OPEX line and may
weigh on the Companys earnings growth
 The payout ratio reduction indicates Gree is preserving cash possibly for MA
 Its valuation remains at a historical high on expectations of a Zhuhai government sell-
down but visibility on the end buyer(s) remains unclear
 Grees high channel inventory slower EPS growth and historically high valuation
make us cautious on the stock We roll forward our forecast to 2020 and update our
TP from RMB40 to RMB44 downgrading to SELL on valuation grounds We continue
to value Gree at 95x 2020 PER
2018 results in line revenue growth stalls in 1Q19
While Grees 2018 results were in line with street expectations we think 1Q19 revenue
growth was a surprise to the downside Grees revenue slowed to 25% YoY in 1Q19 vs
32% growth in 4Q18 We think the slowdown was mostly on account of high channel
inventory levels following channel stuffing during 2H18 though seasonality may have
also played a role CMM data (Figures 2-7) shows retail sales for air conditioning picking
up in March so we expect 2Q19 to show some improvement moving into the peak
season For 2019 Gree believes low double-digit growth is achievable However we
think the high base in 2018 and high channel inventory levels are likely to continue
weighing on Grees sales and think mid-single digit growth is more likely
RD and selling expenses to weigh on earnings growth
Gree is aware that its single market single product focus limits the Companys growth
appliances smart equipment and semi-conductors Grees RD spending for example
increased from 24% to 35% of sales between 2017 and 2018 As Gree continues to
invest in new product lines we think increased selling expense may also pressure the
Companys bottom line Selling expenses have fallen in recent years from 15% of sales
in 2015-16 to just 94% of sales in 2018 But with Gree investing in new product
development and diversifying its revenue mix we think increasing sales and RD
expenses may pressure its bottom line
Payout ratio reduced to 48%
Historically Gree has maintained a 70% payout ratio This years reduction to 50%
suggests the Company is withholding cash for MA activity despite cash reserves of
RMB113Bn
Gree has been re-rated in recent weeks on news that the Zhuhai government is looking
to dispose of its 18% stake in the Company which would lead to improved corporate
decision making and better management incentives However visibility on the buyer(s)
remains low and we think that current valuation at 12x rolling forward consensus is
unlikely to continue (Figures 8-9) We remain cautious about Grees future growth in light
of high channel inventory the lack of new discernible long-term growth drivers and an
inconsistent corporate strategy Gree derives 88% of its revenue from China making its
earnings almost wholly reliant on the domestic China market On this basis we believe
Gree warrants a discount relative to its peers Haier and Midea We raise our 2019-2020
EPS estimates by 3% and 4% on a slightly improving revenue outlook and roll forward
our TP to 2020 We value the Company at 95x 2020E PER implying a target price of
RMB44 or 21% downside In the event of a home appliance stimulus roll-out in 2H19
we think Grees shares are potentially worth RMB47 per share or 15% downside
