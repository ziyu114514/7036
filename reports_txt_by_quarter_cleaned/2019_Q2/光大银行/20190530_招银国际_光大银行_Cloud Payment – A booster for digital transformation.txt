Key points of concern from investors
Wealth management business
CEB started to implement the strategy of building a first-class wealth management bank
in 2018 Wealth management is also one of the six E-SBU (Ecosphere Strategic Business
Unit) of China Everbright Group It is difficult for JSBs to beat large SOE banks in product
scale therefore they tend to stay on the forefront of product innovation In early-2018 CEB
with PBoCs new asset management rule CEB was one of the first two JSBs to receive
CBIRCs approval on establishing wealth management subsidiary and the Bank targets to
be the first JSB to get regulatory permission on business operation
Credit card business has been CEBs strategic focus and contributed to over 30% of the
Banks revenue in the past years After rapid expansion in 2016-2018 credit card business
will moderate and maintain a steady growth pace Looking forward the Bank will carry out
following measures 1) restricting the purpose of credit card overdraft to consumption
instead of cash loans 2) adjusting client mix to 80s and 90s and improving product design
and JD finance
Although CEB had proactively improved recognition and disposal of NPLs in 2018
management remained cautious on asset quality outlook in 2019 They see new NPLs
mainly from overcapacity corporate sectors such as manufacturing and wholesale  retail
which together contributed to 27% of total corporate loans but 57% of corporate NPLs
Classifying above 60-day overdue loans to NPLs may add some pressure That said
management was confident to keep overall asset quality risk under control
NIM trend is likely to remain largely stable on quarterly basis in 2019 Asset yields may
further decline but would be mitigated by optimized loan mix ie higher proportion of retail
loans On the flip side there is limited downside in funding cost but deposit cost will be
controlled with regulatory scrutiny on issuance of structured deposit and certificate of
CB is favored by capital market and encouraged by CSRC It is also cost efficient for banks
as average coupon rate was only 05% for CEBs RMB 30bn CB issued in 2017
Management was confident that the CB would convert to equity as stellar financial
performance would gradually boost the Banks valuation Management also mentioned to
