Guoxuan High-Tech
2018 results delayed  Management cut earlier profit
estimates by more than 30%
 Guoxuan High-Tech made two announcements on 24 April indicating 1) a 30% cut
in previous 2018 earnings guidance and 2) a delay in its 2018 and Q1 2019 results
release from 26 to 30 April
 The earnings guidance cut and the delay in the results release reinforces our cautious
view on Guoxuan High-Techs earnings growth recovery outlook for 20192020
 We will revise our numbers after it releases more detailed results on 30 April We
currently have a SELL rating on Guoxuan High-Tech As a smaller player the
recovery outlook will put its share price under pressure in 2019
Surprising cut to 2018 earnings
Guoxuan High-Tech made two announcements on 24 April indicating 1) a 30% cut in
previous 2018 earnings guidance and 2) a delay in its 2018 and Q1 2019 results release
from 26 to 30 April The downward revision in its 2018 earnings guidance reflects 1) its
more conservative recognition of revenue and costs incurred with counterparties like
Ankai Bus and 2) additional asset impairment made on doubtful accounts receivable
The revised guidance includes a 168% cut in its 2018 revenue guidance and a 319%
cut in its 2018 net profit guidance (Fig 1) The downward revision in its 2018 earnings
guidance suggests there will be downside revision to consensus earnings estimates for
the Company in 20182020E We will adjust our earnings forecast for the Company for
20192020E after it releases its 2018 and Q1 2019 results on 30 April
Disappointing results confirmed our negative view
The earnings guidance cut reinforces our cautious view on Guoxuan High-Techs
earnings growth recovery outlook for 20192020 Even with additional capacity
increases the Company had difficulty achieving its earnings growth recovery in 2018
against market expectations With further subsidy cuts we expect Chinas NEV demand
growth visibility to remain low in 20192020 Even with a positive demand growth the
subsidy cuts will put further pressure on ASP and margins Guoxuan High-Tech doesnt
the massive government subsidy cut With a downward revision in its 2018 earnings we
think its 2019 earnings growth visibility will also worsen
As we highlighted in our initiation report published on 17 April Guoxuan High-Tech is a
As a 2nd tier industry player the Company should face more challenges meeting
demand from major OEMs for technology development and cost reductions Without any
firm bonds with major OEMs we expect Guoxuan High-Tech to lose market share in
China and to have greater difficulty growing into a global player in the long term
We have a SELL rating on Guoxuan High-Tech with a target price (TP) of Rmb1100 Our
TP is based on a target 2019E PER multiple of 13x (13x PEG) The poor earnings
growth recovery outlook should put its share price under pressure in 2019 We will adjust
our TP after we revise our numbers after the release of its 2018 and Q1 2019 results
