Guoxuan High-Tech
 We update our earnings forecast for Guoxuan High-Tech in 20192020
 Guoxuan High-Techs earnings miss in 2018 was in line with our cautious view on the
Companys core power battery business growth outlook Earnings growth recovered in
Q1 2019 but margin contraction remained a major concern for its earnings growth
recovery potential in 20192020E
 We think further government subsidy cuts will put more pressure on Chinas power
battery demand growth in 20192020 In addition as a smaller player it should face
more pressure on its ASP and margins Accordingly we cut our earnings forecast for
the Company for 20192020E by 2030%
 We maintain our SELL rating on Guoxuan High-Tech and cut our target price (TP) by
29% to Rmb780 (13x 2019E PER) Our TP is derived from our lower earnings
forecast for the Company in 20192020E
2018 results a big miss Q1 2019 earnings growth recovered but
margin contraction remains a big concern
Guoxuans total revenue in 2018 grew only 60% YoY 166% below its revenue
guidance With bigger margin contraction and additional asset impairment for doubtful
accounts receivable its net profit continued to fall 308% YoY in 2018 to
RMB580m 30% below its 2018 earnings guidance Its revenue growth in Q1 2019
accelerated to 653% YoY  driven mainly by its core NEV battery segment as OEMs are
pushing NEV sales before the new subsidy policy takes effect on 26 June But its gross
profit margin contracted by 28ppt YoY to 300% in Q1 2019 There were some SGA
cost savings But rising financing costs and a higher effective tax rate led to net profit
growth of only 252% YoY in Q1 2019
Low earnings growth visibility due to NEV demand growth
uncertainty and margin pressure from further ASP cuts
With further subsidy cuts we expect Chinas NEV demand growth visibility to remain low
in 20192020 Although NEV battery sales volume in Q1 2019 grew 1826% YoY in
China this was mainly due to OEMs boosting sales before the new subsidy policy takes
effect In addition the subsidy cuts will put further pressure on ASP and margins for
power battery producers Guoxuan High-Tech doesnt have the same technology and
subsidy cut Therefore we cut our revenue forecast for the Company in 2019E by 142%
and maintain our revenue forecast for the Company in 2020E Considering further
downward pressure on margins we cut our earnings forecast for the Company in 2019
and 2020E by 337% and 244% respectively Overall we expect its earnings to grow
69% and 238% YoY in 2019 and 2020E respectively
Rising accounts receivable a red flag
Accounts receivables at the end of 2018 represented 123% of its total revenue in 2018
vs 91% at the end of 2017 and 57% at the end of 2016 Accounts receivable turnover
days also lengthened to 382 days in 2018 from 268 days in 2017 and 175 days in 2016
Operating cash flow remained negative in 2016 and 2017 Operating cash outflow rose
from Rmb100m in 2017 to Rmb1559m in 2018 Although operating cash flow in Q1 2019
showed signs of improvement the full-year operating cash flow situation still remains
wait-and-see
We maintain SELL on Guoxuan High-Tech and cut our target price (TP) from Rmb1100
to Rmb780 based on the same target 2019E PER multiple of 13x The TP cut is derived
mainly from our lower earnings estimates for 20192020
