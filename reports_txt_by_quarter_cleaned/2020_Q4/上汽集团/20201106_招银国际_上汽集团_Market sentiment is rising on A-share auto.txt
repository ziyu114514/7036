In the first three quarters SAIC achieved total revenue of RMB4987bn down
148% YoY while NP was RMB167bn down 199% YoY In 3Q20 revenue was
RMB2149bn an increase of 28% YoY while NP was RMB83bn an increase of
174% YoY We raise our TP to RMB339 (based on 135x 2021E PE) with an
upside of 233% from TP RMB211 based on 115x 2020E PE Upgrade to BUY
 In 3Q20 GPM was 110% down 24ppt YoY reflecting intensified market
SD exp -20ppt Admin exp -03ppt) The decrease in SD exp ratio was
mainly due to 1) implementation of the new accounting standard in the current
period which moves the car loan interest subsidy from SD expense to
revenue recognition offset and 2) the YoY decrease of logistic expense and
advertising expense
associates was RMB66bn an increase of 29% YoY SAIC Volkswagen
achieved sales of 454K units in 3Q20 down 4% YoY SAIC GM achieved
sales of 395K units an increase of 3% YoY We believe the main factor which
from financial assets
 The sales performance of major JVs is still mixed SAIC Volkswagen
launched a mid-term facelift version Santana in Oct (-23% YoY in 3Q20) At
the end of Oct the first BEV based on the MEB platform namely ID4 was put
into production We expect both new models to drive the recovery of the
Volkswagen brand However the Skoda brand fell 29% YoY in 3Q20 which
is still expected to drag down the recovery of SAIC Volkswagen in the short-
term For SAIC-GM the sales volume of Excelle (英朗) in Sep exceeded 30K
units after the re-launch of four-cylinder version As a result Buick achieved a
30% YoY growth in 3Q20 The sales of high-end brand Cadillac increased by
75% YoY given the strong performance in overall luxury segment However
due to lack of brand power Chevrolet declined by 47% YoY dragged down
the overall performance of SAIC GM
