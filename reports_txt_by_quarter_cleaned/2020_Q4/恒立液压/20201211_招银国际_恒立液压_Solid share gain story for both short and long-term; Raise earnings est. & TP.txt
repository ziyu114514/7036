Sector  Sustainable demand for
excavator in 2H20E  12 Aug 2020
SHSZ300  (rebased)
We see potential earnings upside in 2020E-22E driven by several drivers (1)
Short term Henglis production plan in Dec implies 20% MoM increase in
hydraulic cylinders output volume which is surprisingly strong (2) Medium term
Solid market share gain on the back of the rising market share of Chinese-brand
excavator manufactures (Henglis customers) (3) Long-term Trend of import
substitution of pump  valves and other products is clear We revise up our
earnings forecast in 2020E-22E by 8-10% (9-10% above consensus) after
revising up both sales volume and gross margin assumptions We continue to
clear roadmap to achieve import substitution Our TP is lifted to RMB1144 from
RMB87 based on 55x 2021E PE (30% premium to the historical average of 42x)
 Resilient demand for excavator in 2021E For the industry as a whole major
manufacturers of excavator delivered sales volume of 296k units in 11M20
up 37% YoY according to CCMA We expect the full year sales volume growth
will reach 40% In 2021E we see upside to our existing excavator demand
growth forecast of 3% driven by infrastructure spending growth and the
continuous trend of the substitution of labour by excavators
 Henglis growth is driven by structural factors We estimate a single-digit
growth of excavator demand will be enough for Hengli to deliver 20% revenue
growth in 2021E given that the Chinese excavator makers (majority of them
are Henglis customers with high installation ratios) such as SANY Heavy
(600031 CH BUY) are gaining market share which will drive Henglis share
gain We forecast Henglis market share in hydraulic cylinder to increase from
52% in 2020E to 61% in 2022E Besides we expect pump  valve for large-
various industries will serve as other key drivers
 Latest production plan suggests robust demand in 1Q21E According to
Henglis production plan in Dec the scheduled production volume of hydraulic
cylinder (for excavator) is expected to reach 79k units up 20% MoM We
estimate this will translate into 40k units for excavator demand for the
industry in Jan 2021E which is impressive given that the industry sales
volume was only 99k units in Jan 2020 On the other hand we expect Henglis
hydraulic pump and valves will see strong growth in Dec on MoM basis
 Key risks (1) Slowdown of construction activities (2) risk of overseas
expansion (3) increase in raw materials cost

We raise our TP to RMB1144 from RMB87 based on 55x 2021E PE (30% premium to
the historical average of 42x) We believe the valuation premium is justified due to
improving earnings visibility for a couple of reasons (1) the policy of domestic circulation
