Reiterate BUY We expect Henglis share price momentum to continue driven by
several near-term catalysts (1) We forecast Hengli to report an impressive net
profit growth of 95% YoY in 3Q20E (2) Henglis production plan in Oct suggests
robust demand to continue across major products (3) improvement in
construction activities will continue to offer strong support to the demand for
excavators and other machinery going forward We revised up our earnings
forecast in 2020E-22E by 3-6% (9-10% above consensus) Our TP is lifted to
RMB87 from RMB82 based on unchanged multiple of 45x 2021E PE (historical
 3Q20E results preview We estimate that Henglis hydraulic cylinder volume
reached 170k units (for excavators) and 34k units (for non-standardized
products) in 3Q20E Fast growing products such as valves and motors saw
sequential monthly sales increase in 3Q We forecast Hengli to deliver
revenue growth of 50% YoY with gross margin expansion YoY thanks to
higher utilization rate We estimate net profit to grow 95% YoY to RMB481mn
in 3Q Hengli is scheduled to report the results on 27 Oct
 Production volume to stay high in Oct Based on our understanding
excavator cylinder monthly production volume reached 63k units in Sep
suggesting sequential growth According to the production plan in Oct
excavator cylinder volume is expected to stay at similar level Besides the
production plan for pump and valves implies sequential growth in Oct We
expect robust demand throughout 4Q on the back of strong construction
activities
 Key risks (1) Slowdown of construction activities (2) risk of overseas
expansion (3) increase in raw materials cost
