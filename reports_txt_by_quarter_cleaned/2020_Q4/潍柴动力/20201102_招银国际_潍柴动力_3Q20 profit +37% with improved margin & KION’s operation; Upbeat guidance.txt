encouraging as (1) revenue surged 48% YoY which is above expectation (2)
gross margin rebounded 17ppt QoQ which should ease market concerns We
see several positive drivers going forward (1) Management is confident of
achieving sequential gross margin improvement in 4Q20E (2) Latest guidance
of KION (KGX GR) offers improved visibility (3) New business growth is on good
track We raised our earnings forecast in 2020E-22E by 2-5% due mainly to
higher sales volume assumptions Our SOTP is lifted from RMB168 to RMB179
after rolling over the base year to 2021E Maintain BUY
