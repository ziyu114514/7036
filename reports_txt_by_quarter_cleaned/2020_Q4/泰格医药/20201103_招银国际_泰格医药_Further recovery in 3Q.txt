 Solid earnings growth in 3Q20 Tigermed reported 3Q20 revenue of
RMB848mn up 223% YoY which accelerated from 86% YoY revenue
growth in 1H20 Attributable net profit was up 814% YoY in 3Q20 to
RMB319mn including RMB288mn one-off fair value gains and investment
gains Adjusted net profit rose 294% YoY in 3Q20 to RMB195mn driven by
both solid topline growth and margin improvement Gross margin improved
289ppts in 3Q20 vs 3Q19 mainly due to the consolidation of acquired targets
 Strong quarterly recovery Recall that Tigermeds operation was interrupted
by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020 As the pandemic got largely controlled
in China clinical trial operations started to normalize from 2Q20 leading to
recovery in Tigermeds domestic revenue However the COVID-19 outbreak
worsened in overseas regions such as the US and Europe As a result the
overseas CRO demand such as data management services and Frontages
BIO CMC DMPK services were negatively impacted In 1H20 Tigermed
received 42% of total revenue from overseas and 40% of gross profit from
overseas We expect the COVID-19 epidemic to gradually ease in 2021E
thanks to the wide supply of vaccines which will drive further business
recovery for Tigermed
 H-share IPO brings sufficient capital for Tigermeds global expansion
total of HK1182bn net proceeds With sufficient cash on hand we expect
Tigermed to accelerate its pace of global expansion via both acquisitions and
self-expansion Given Chinas large patient pool international pharmaceutical
doing many MRCTs for the purpose of product registration in overseas
countries Tigermed provides clinical CRO services for Chinese innovative
products to go global and multinational enterprises innovative products to
enter Chinese market The Company already has established good network
in Asia Pacific regions while US market could be the next emphasis
 Maintain BUY We raised our 2020E21E net profit forecasts by 90%17%
respectively to factor in fair value gains and investment gains and raised
SOTP-based TP to RMB14643 implying 70x FY22E PE We like Tigermed
given its leading positioning in clinical CRO space and large potential in
overseas expansion
