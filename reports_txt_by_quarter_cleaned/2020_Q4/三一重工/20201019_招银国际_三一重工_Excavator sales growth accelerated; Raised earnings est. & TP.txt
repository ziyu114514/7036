UpDownside
Reiterate BUY The acceleration of excavator sales growth in Sep reaffirms our
positive view on the industry upcycle Besides we remain confident on SANYs
market share gain story on the back of strong RD and management execution
We raised our 2020E-22E earnings forecast for SANY by 5-6% after
incorporating higher sales volume assumptions We raised our TP from RMB264
to RMB346 after rolling over our target PE multiple (17x) to 2021E PE on the
back of 17% estimated earnings growth in 2021E
 Industry sales growth of excavator accelerated in Sep According to the
latest figure from CCMA excavator sales volume by major players in China
surged 65% YoY to 26k units in Sep the highest growth rate since May Large
 mid-size excavator sales growth reached 53%106% YoY in Sep which
suggested strong demand from infrastructure and property construction
projects In 9M20 excavator sales growth reached 32% YoY
 Raise industry sales projection Based on Jiangsu Henglis (601100 CH
BUY) latest production plan of hydraulic cylinders (see our latest note on
Hengli link) we foresee strong excavator demand growth with high visibility
in 4Q20E We raise our industry excavator sales volume assumption in
2020E21E by 13%10% We expect 35%3% YoY growth in 2020E21E with
and stringent environmental policies
 SANY continues to outpace industry growth SANYs excavator sales
volume in Sep surged 85% YoY outpacing the industry growth of 65%
SANYs market share reached 285%263% in Sep  9M20 SANY is one of
the very few players that consistently delivers market share gain We believe
import substitution and export market are two structural drivers for SANY
going forward
 3Q20E results preview We forecast SANY to deliver 60% YoY net profit
growth in 3Q20E driven by 44% YoY increase in revenue and operating
leverage SANY is scheduled to report on 29 Oct
 Key risks (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic (2) Slowdown of
construction activities (3) Risk of expanding to financing business
