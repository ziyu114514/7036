UpDownside
SANY Heavys net profit in 3Q20 grew 57% YoY to RMB386bn in line with our
positive on SANY Heavy due to the high visibility of machinery demand
continuous market share gain and on-track cost reduction driven by automation
of production We left our earnings forecast unchanged Reiterate BUY with TP
of RMB346 (based on 17x 2021E PE)
 Key highlights on 3Q20 results Revenue grew 55% YoY to RMB239bn in
3Q20 Gross margin narrowed by 28ppt YoY to 304% but was more than
offset by good expense control and operating leverage Selling and
distribution expense ratio reduced 17ppt YoY to 51% SANY boosted the
RD spending by 51% YoY to RMB128bn in 3Q and we believe the
continuous spending growth will continue to help SANY widen its advantage
9M20 net profit grew 35% YoY to RMB124bn accounting for 83% of our full
year estimates (run rate in 9M19 82%) Operating cash inflow increased by
33% YoY to RMB11bn largely in line with the net profit growth
 Auto financing business consolidated in 3Q20 results In Dec 2019
SANY announced to acquire 914% interest in SANY Capital (the auto
financing business) for a consideration of RMB338bn The transaction was
20% YoY to RMB104mn We calculate that the net interest margin in 3Q20
was 89% (annualized) That said we do not expect the auto financing
business to be a profit driver as it serves the purpose of driving the machinery
 Key risks (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic (2) Slowdown of
construction activities (3) Risk of expanding to financing business
