事件：近日贵州茅台发布国有股份无偿划转、收到相关事项监管
工作函、简式权益变动报告书等公告，媒体还报道国家市场监管
总局召开全国茅台酒经销商代表行政指导会、加强两节期间茅台
等名优白酒价格监管等新闻。
茅台集团对贵州经济意义重大，需要保持平稳较快增长。据人民
日报报道，目前茅台集团正朝着1100 亿元的营收目标稳步前进。
未来5 年，茅台集团提出要成为世界500 强企业的愿景。这一目
标写进了贵州省国民经济和社会发展第十四个五年规划和二三
五年远景目标的建议。十四五时期贵州省希望保持经济增速高于
全国平均水平，我们预计茅台集团营业收入有望翻番，年复合增
茅台股份公司实现业绩增长的手段较多。一是放量，基酒不缺的
2020 年公司产量几乎没有增长，加上历史基酒储备预计明年实现
高个位数增速不难；二是提高均价，包括2020 年已使用的提高自
营、直销渠道比例，增加高毛利产品占比，也可能重启历史上使
用过的计划外价格；三是提高出厂价并非不可能，前提条件是市
场价格平稳且可控，目前条件不具备不意味着未来实现不了。
估值高位已持续较长时间，后期主要看资金面。全球流动性宽
裕、其他版块业绩不佳，推升了今年食品饮料版块整体估值，而
年初以来业绩预测偏差并不大。因此我们认为在投资者对公司基
本面预期趋于一致后，未来估值变化更多取决投资于食品饮料的
流动性，这方面建议关注海通宏观和策略的研究。
业绩预测与投资建议。我们预计公司未来三年营业总收入与归母
净利润双位数增长有保障，不排除阶段性加速。我们维持2020-
2022 年公司EPS 为371545105205 元，考虑到可比公司2021
年平均PE44 倍我们维持2021 年45x 估值不变，维持目标价2025
风险因素：价格过高抑制实际消费，渠道改革引发利益冲突，价
格由涨转跌影响销售。
