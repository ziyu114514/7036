BYD announced that total auto sales volume achieved 48K units in Oct an
increase of 161% YoY Among these NEPV achieved 22K units an increase of
831% YoY 185% MoM The Company announced its 4Q20E earnings guidance
with a bottom-line range of RMB 42bn-46bn in 2021E We believe BYD will
benefit most from recent improving sentiment on NEV from both sales volume
and market sentiment perspective We raised our bottom-line forecast by 24% to
RMB 52bn in 2020E to reflect a higher ASP and GPM on auto segment
Reiterate BUY rating and raise TP to RMB2238
 BYD continues rapid growth in NEV segment in Oct BYD sold 47K units
(ICENEV) of auto in Oct an increase of 161%YoY Its NEV business
remains on the high growth path with a total sales volume of 23K units an
increase of 847% YoY Among these NEPV achieved 22K units (831%
YoY) whereas NECV achieved 12K units (1232% YoY) We believe that the
total delivery of model Han is in line with our expectations with a total volume
of 7545 units in Oct We expect that the sales volume of Han will continue to
rise MoM within the year as the production of the blade battery is ramping up
In terms of ICE sales reached 25K units in Oct down 142% YoYup 99%
 3Q20 achieved RMB175bn an increase 1363% YoY in line with the
Companys earnings preview Among them BYD Electronics (285 HK BUY)
contributed approximately RMB122mn while other segments contributed
RMB527mn We believe that a series of new models underpinned by
production ramp-up of blade battery will support the sales performance in the
short term We expect BYD will achieve total NEPV sales of 45K units in Nov
 Dec an increase of 112%YoY We expect DM40 (expected rollout in
1Q21E) and new BEV platform (expected rollout in 2021 Shanghai Auto Show)
will further boost its NEV sales in 2021E
 Higher ASP and GPM raise the 2021E bottom-line forecast We expect
that strong sales of model Han among its NEPV will increase to 20% in NEV
sales mixbased on our new calculation Therefore aggregate ASP for the
NEPV segment increased by 9% to RMB187Kin 2020 In the meanwhile we
believe that BYD will continue to utilize its cost control advantage driving its
improvement in GPM of auto segment We therefore raised our 2021E
earnings forecast by 30% to RMB688mn

 Sentiment-driven re-rating on the NEV segment  BYDs share price
performed well exceed our expectation while fundamentals were largely on
track with our projection We think BYDs re-rating was mainly sentimentally
driven on an optimistic outlook for the NEV segment Based on our SOTP
framework we believe the market is currently pricing the NEV segment at a
55x FY21E PS ratio After peers recent share price rally we believe BYDs
NEV valuation is significantly lower than the peers average of 101x FY21E
PS Based on FY21E NEV sales projection of RMB628bn we expect 1) bull
case share price to trade up 89x PS at RMB263 in line with Tesla (TSLA
US NR)s valuation in a thrilling market sentiment 2) bear case share price
to trade down to 3x PS at RMB1457 and 3) base case valuation of 7x
PS at RMB2238 matching with peers valuation growth with 30% discount
Our valuation revision reflects changes only on the NEV segment and we
think other catalysts such as power batteries gaining external shipment could
boost valuation further Our TP for BYD is revised up by 437% to
RMB2238 maintain BUY
