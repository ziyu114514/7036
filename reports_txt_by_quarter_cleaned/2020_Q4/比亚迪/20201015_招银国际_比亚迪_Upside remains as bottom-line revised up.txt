BYD announced that total auto sales volume achieved 42K units in Sep an
increase of 36% YoY Among these NEPV achieved 20K units an increase of
425% YoY 328% MoM The Company raised its 3Q20E earnings guidance with
a new bottom-line range of RMB 34-36bn in the first three quarters of 2020E
We have confidence in BYDs sales volume in the 4Q20E and remain optimistic
about its performance in 2021E given its new product cycle We raise our bottom-
line forecast by 7% to RMB 42bn in 2020E Reiterate BUY rating and raise TP
to RMB1557
 Benefited from the recovery of Chinas overall NEV market BYD
achieved rapid growth in its NEV segment in Sep BYD sold 42K units
(ICENEV) of auto in Sep an increase of 36%YoY Its NEV business has
rebounded back to a high growth path with a total sales volume of 20K units
an increase of 453% YoY Among these NEPV achieved 19K units
(425%YoY) whereas NECV achieved 13K units (328%YoY) We believe
that the total delivery of model Han is in line with our expectations with a total
volume of 5612 units in Sep We expect that the sales volume of Han will
continue to rise in 4Q20E as the production of the blade battery is ramping up
In terms of ICE sales reached 22K units in Sep down 176%YoY
 Sales volume of NEPV in 4Q20E is expected to be doubled YoY Given
the cut-off day of NEV subsidy 4Q is the traditional sales peak season for
side was postponed to 2H20E As a result we expect to-B side demand may
exceed market expectations in 4Q20E On the to-C end BYD has launched
its new model Tang DM and Song Plus since Aug It is expected that the blade
battery version of Tang EV e2 e3 together with Yuan EV (facelift version)
will be launched in the 4Q20E We believe that a series of new models
underpinned by production ramp-up of blade battery will bring BYDs NEV
sales back to the high growth path in 4Q20E We expect BYD will achieve
total NEPV sales of 67K units in 4Q20E an increase of 102%YoY

 BYDE (285 HK) is expected to beat market expectations For Apple
BYDE has obtained a 20-30% share of the latest 2H20E iPad models and it
will reach 30-40% of all iPad products by 2021E As Apple will accelerate the
diversification of suppliers we expect BYDE will expand to iPad metal casing
and gain share in iPhonewatch ceramic products in 2021E In terms of
headset EMS Xiaomi will offset the negative impact of Huawei in 2021E In
order to mitigate the downside risks brought about by the Huawei ban we
expect BYDE to expand EMS capacity for Xiaomi with share allocation to 40%
in FY21E (vs 10-20% in FY20E) In addition backed by SamsungXiaomis
promising outlook in 2021 we expect strong demand for glassceramic casing
given rapid 5G adoption
 The Company revised up its 3Q20E earnings guidance BYD revised its
performance guidance for the first three quarters from the previous RMB28-
30bn to RMB34-36bn representing an increase of 116-129% YoY It implies
the net profit will achieve RMB14-19bn in 3Q20E an increase of 1352% to
1519% YoY We believe it was mainly due to the recovery of the auto industry
and the introduction of new business in BYDE We slightly lowered our full-
year revenue forecast by 3% to RMB 157bn to reflect the revenue adjustment
of BYDE In the meanwhile we raised our bottom-line forecast by 7% to RMB
42bn in 2020E to reflect the rise in profitability of the auto and BYDE business
The Company plans to release 3Q quarterly reports on 29 Oct
 Continuous valuation boost from NEV segment raise TP by 376% to
RMB1557 BYDs share price has surged more than 37% since our
previous update (8 Sep) We think BYDs strong share price momentum
reflects re-rating on the NEV segment as we expect current valuation
indicates 25x FY21E PS on forward-looking NEV sales Based on the rapid
think the NEV segments re-rating is not yet done We lift our NEV PS multiple
from 20x to 40x (vs 70x from emerging NEV names) and boost our NEV
segment valuation by 891% Our SOTP TP is raised by 376% to RMB1557
