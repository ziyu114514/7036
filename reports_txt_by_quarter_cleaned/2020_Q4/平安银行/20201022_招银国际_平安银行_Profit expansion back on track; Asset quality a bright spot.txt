After a sharp decline in 2Q20 PABs earnings regained positive growth of
61% YoY in 3Q20 As such YTD profit contraction narrowed to -52% in 9M20
YoY from -112% YoY in 1H20 Key results highlights are fast pick-up in retail
4Q20 outlook given 1) strong macro trend thus waning policy intervention on
banks earnings 2) continued recovery in consumption and retail credit 3)
interbank rates will likely retreat on loose liquidity easing NIM pressure and 4)
above-peers provision coverage offers room to lower credit cost
 Results positives 1) Loan growth was solid at 31% QoQ mainly driven
by retail loans (57% QoQ) In particular new mortgage (75% QoQ) and
auto loans (104% QoQ) remained strong and credit card resumed
expansion (30% QoQ) from 1H20 contraction Proportion of retail loans
increased to 58% of total loans as of 3Q20 2) Asset quality improved
notably PAB accelerated NPL disposal in 3Q20 As a result NPL ratio
dropped 33bp QoQ to 132% and provision coverage further climbed to
34ppt QoQ to 218% NPLs still covered 104% of 60day overdue loans
fell 14ppt YoY to 29% in 3Q20 suggesting better operating efficiency 5)
Stable expansion in retail client base Number of retail wealth private
banking client rose 19%45%82% QoQ Retail AUM increased 72% QoQ
to RMB249tn
 Results negatives 1) NIM declined 11bp QoQ to 248% Loan yield slid
32bp QoQ likely on write-off in retail loans past due and the Banks more
prudent lending appetite Lower deposit cost was partly offset by rising
interbank funding cost as market rates rebounded in 3Q20 2) Trading and
investment gain was down 72% YoY likely due to bond yield hike in 3Q20
3) Deposits rose 25% QoQ slower than loan growth LDR increased to
1005% 4) Capital position weakened with 5bp10bp QoQ decline in
