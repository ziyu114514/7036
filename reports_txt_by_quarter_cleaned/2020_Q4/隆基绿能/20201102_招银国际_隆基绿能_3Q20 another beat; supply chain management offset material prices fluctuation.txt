LONGi realized 3Q20 net profit of RMB2240mn beat our expectation The
Company continued to deliver outstanding GPM from wafer and module at above
30%20% respectively despite the fact that poly-si and PV glass price
experienced substantial hike during the quarter We think LONGis supply chain
management and insight to the market helped sustain its leading profitability
Looking ahead we expect LONGi to accelerate wafer and module sales to 26bn
piece and 58GW respectively We raise FY20-22E EPS forecast by 82%-300%
to RMB225310406 respectively Our TP is lifted to RMB900 based on
290x FY21E PER Maintain BUY
 3Q20 results beat again 3Q external wafermodule shipment surged 237%
1146% respectively to 157bn piece591GW Major expenses were
maintained stable while net financial turned negative as LONGi employed
higher debt Operating cash flow exhibited strong rebound as bills receivables
accumulated in 1H20 were released during the quarter and advanced
customer payment from domestic clients were mostly paid in cash due to
tightened module supply 3Q20 net profit was RMB2240mn up 519% YoY
and largely flat QoQ In 9M20 LONGi realized net profit of RMB6357mn up
824% YoY accounting for 81% of our previous 2020E earnings estimates
 Supply chain management was a key highlight in 3Q20 Poly-si price
experienced a sharp hike from Jul after supply disruption in Xinjiang LONGi
was able to manage supply shortage impacts through building low costs poly-
si inventories in 1H20 and signing long term purchasing as well as upstream
investments contracts to secure poly-si supply For PV glass we think LONGi
took similar measures as poly-si and the Company also intends to develop
more new suppliers with incentives such as large-scale order or direct
investments Mgmt disclosed 3Q20 GPM of wafermodule were above
30%20% respectively which were higher than our expectation
 GPM guidance to remain stable in 4Q20 LONGi had lifted wafer price for
several times in view of poly-si price hike Mgmt remained confident to
maintain wafer sales profitability with pricing adjustments as low costs
inventories were consumed For module end we think LONGi will be able to
pass through majority of poly-si and PV glass costs change to downstream PV
farm developers Overall we think LONGi will be able to sustain its profitability

 Lift FY20-22E earnings by 82-30% LONGis supply chain performance and
costs passthrough capability continued to exceed our expectation  Based on
wafermodule shipment of 26bn pieces58GW in 4Q20 with slightly lifted ASP
we revise FY20E EPS projection by 82% to RMB225 For 2021-22E on the
back of accelerating capacity growth and more optimistic ASP outlook we
raise EPS forecast by 204%300% respectively to RMB310406 We roll
over valuation to FY21E based on 29x PE multiple Our TP is raised by 243%
to RMB900 Maintain BUY
 Risk factors 1) short of Poly-Si and PV glass to support capacity expansion
in 2021E and 2) cell technology upgrade to HJT at faster-than-expected pace
