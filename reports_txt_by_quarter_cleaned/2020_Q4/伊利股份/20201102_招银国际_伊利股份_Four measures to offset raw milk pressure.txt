3Q20 NP 24% YoY to RMB2289mn 9% above consensus due to
price drop last Friday was partly because share price already ran ahead of 3Q20
results release Share price jumped 9% from 23 to 29 Oct (vs MNs 1% drop) We
think Yili will implement four measures to offset raw milk pressure and therefore
we kept FY2122E NP estimates unchanged We expect Yili would continue to
benefit from industry consolidation Maintain Buy
 3Q20 NP beat but GPM missed Revenue rose 11% YoY in 3Q20 which is
in line with consensus and our expectation led by 19%10%1% growth of
milk powderliquid milkice-cream segments GPM fell 13ppt to 347%
because of 6-7% raw milk price growth (RMB45kg in 3Q20 vs China Modern
Dairys ASP RMB42kg) and dilution by Westland That said selling
expenses ratio fell 14ppt to 205% offsetting the impact of GPM decline
 Four measures to offset raw milk pressure Management expects raw milk
price to grow by high single-digit in 2H20E and increase further in FY21E (1)
Reduce discount promotion Our sources of channel check found retail
prices of Satine rose to RMB65 in second half of Oct (highest level since Feb)
and so did MNs Milk Deluxe (Figure 4  5) Management expects the sector
would be more disciplined in promotions (2) Control raw milk source Yili
became the largest shareholder of Zhongdi (1492 HK) in Sep and its associate
innovation For example Ambrosial launched a high-end 5G protein in Aug
and Satine will launch a high-end 40g UHT milk in 1Q21 The retail pricegram
of 5G protein is more than double of Ambrosial original favour (Figure 6  7) (4)
Improve efficiency of selling expenses Selling expenses ratio fell 09ppt to
227% in 9M20 through more precise marketing such as online advertising Its
123% AP exp ratio in FY19 was higher than many major consumer names
(Figure 9) As dairy sector leader we think Yili has room to improve efficiency
Management expects slight drop of selling expenses ratio in FY21E
In the 14th five year period Yili will strengthen its leadership and growth in
dairy sector while sales contribution by non-dairy products and overseas
market will not be significant At a 10% sales CAGR in 2019-25 we believe
Yili could reach top 3 in 2025 (Figure 8)
 Maintain Buy We lifted FY20E NP by 4% to reflect strong 3Q20 results and
maintain our NP estimates in FY2122E Our TP is kept at RMB4590 still
based on 32x FY21E PE Catalysts better-than-expected revenue and
margins Risks Raw milk cost pressure food safety issues
