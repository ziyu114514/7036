(Previous TP
UpDownside
2 Nov 2020
3Q20 was a clear beat for Midea (even excluding the one-off investment and fair
products and strong export order outlook Therefore we maintain BUY and lifted
TP to RMB 9524 based on 22x FY21E PE (up from 20x) vs China Intl peers
avg of 21x 17x
 3Q20 results was a strong beat Midea sales net profit att increased by
16% 32% YoY to RMB 777bn 81bn in 3Q20 beating BBG and CMBIs est
by 9% 32% and 8%27% We attributed the beat to 1) robust sales growth
(both domestic and export) and 2) significant investment and fair value gains
Noted that 34ppt YoY GP margin drop was mainly due to 1) relocating of
installation fees to COGS (from selling expenses) and 2) higher mix of e-
adjusted net profit att still managed to grow by 19% YoY still a beat
 Both domestic and export sales growth accelerated while AC was the
main driver Mideas domestic and export sales growth speeded up to 22%
18% YoY from 16% drop and 0% in 1H20 We believe the beat in domestic
sales was mainly driven by exceptional market shares gain in the AC
segment (3ppt YoY to 33% in online and 6ppt YoY to 35% in offline in 3Q20
according to AVC) We think innovations such as No Wind Feeling (无风感)
and 180% Rotation Wind Channel (180旋转风道) were the key While the
beat in export sales was more an industry-wise pick up in our view where
sales growth for fridge WM AC were booming at 57% 17% 15% YoY in
Sep 2020 We now forecast a 14% sales and 24% net profit growth in 4Q20E
However despite the momentum we should be aware of potential drags on
GP margin due to recent CNY appreciation
 KUKA business begins to recover KUKA registered a turnaround in profit
in 3Q20 which is certainly a beat and its sales growth in 4Q20E should likely
resume as its future orders also recorded 20% YoY growth
 Maintain BUY but raised TP to RMB 9524 (22% upside) We reiterate BUY
because of 1) industry leading sales growth 2) robust exports market and 3)
continual sector turnaround and re-rating We fine-tuned FY20E 21E 22E NP
by 7% 0% 0% to factor in better sales growth but a weaker GP margin Our
new TP is based on 22x FY21E PE (up from 20x due to stronger than peers
growth) The counter now trades at 18x 21E PE (vs China peers avg of 21x)
or 19x PEG (vs China peers 29x)
