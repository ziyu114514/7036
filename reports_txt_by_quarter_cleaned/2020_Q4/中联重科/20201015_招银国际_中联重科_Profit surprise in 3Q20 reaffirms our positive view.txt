Zoomlion released a positive profit alert last night stating that the net profit in
3Q20E would surge 64-97% YoY to RMB148-178bn The high-end of the range
is above our expectation We expect Zoomlions growth will continue to be driven
by both the upcycle of existing products (concrete crane and agricultural
machinery) and the Companys expansion in new products Besides we believe
raising exercise will further enhance market confidence Maintain BUY with TP of
RMB102 (12x 2020E PE)
 9M20E net profit up 58%-67% YoY Zoomlion estimated the net profit in
9M20E to be in the range of RMB55-58bn This would represent 76%-80%
of our above-consensus full year estimate and we see potential upside to the
consensus forecast The growth in 9M20E was driven by the infrastructure
new energy and agricultural machinery Besides new business such as aerial
working platform (AWP) and excavator continued to achieve breakthrough in
the market
believe has yet to reflect the Companys structural growth potential We expect
placement in early 2021E will serve as share price catalysts Besides the
potential upside on Chinas wind power installation target in the 14th FYP will
lift the demand for truck crane
 Risk factors (1) Unexpected weakness on infrastructure spending (2) Slow
recovery of property construction (3) Risks of new business expansion
