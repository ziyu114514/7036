Zoomlions 3Q20 profit is solid (85% YoY) and managements post-results
sequentially) suggest that the business outlook remains favourable We believe
the recent share price pullback on concerns over margin was overdone and we
see this as good buying opportunity We slightly took our 2020E-22E earnings
forecast down by 2-4% after modelling higher sales volume but more
conservative margins We fine-tuned our TP from RMB102 to RMB956 after
rolling over our base year to 2021E with a target multiple of 10x (previously 12x
2020E PE) Maintain BUY
 Key highlight on 3Q20 results Net profit in 3Q20 surged 85% YoY to
RMB167bn within the range of profit alert (RMB148-178bn) released in mid-
Oct Revenue grew 73% YoY to RMB164bn while gross margin narrowed
24ppt YoY and 18ppt QoQ to 27% Net operating cash inflow increased by
58% YoY to RMB26bn in 3Q
 Strong growth across all segments In 9M20 concrete machinery and
crane revenue increased by 34% YoY and 44% YoY respectively to
RMB137bn and RMB236bn Agricultural machinery revenue grew 35% YoY
For new business lines revenue from excavator surged 244% YoY while
revenue from aerial working platform (AWP) grew 60% YoY
 Gross margin to rebound in 4Q20E Gross margin contraction in 3Q20 was
due to (1) higher sales of smaller size truck cranes and tower crane that
carried lower margin (2) higher growth of concrete mixer (lower margin) than
the concrete pump (3) fast growing AWP and excavator which had lower
management is confident of achieving better margin in 4Q20E as (1) new
business margin keeps improving and (2) the Companys central
procurement policy started in 3Q20 will help reduce cost going forward
 Positive outlook in 4Q20E and 2021E Management believes that solid
infrastructure and property investment together with the replacement of
labour and strict environmental protection policies are all favourable drivers
Besides large players are beneficiaries of rising industry concentration
Management believes that this round of upcycle will be stronger than the
previous one
