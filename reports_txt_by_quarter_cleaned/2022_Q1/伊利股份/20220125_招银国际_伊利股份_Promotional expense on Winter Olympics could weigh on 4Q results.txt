UpDownside
We trim our 2021E net profits by 15% to RMB8902mn subsequent to our
incorporation of a 09pp higher opex ratio (of 287%) for 4Q21 due to any
promotional expense for the Winter Olympics In other words we lowered our
4Q21E net profit estimate to RMB958mn which is now about 2% below
consensus Meanwhile we leave our 2021E top line largely unchanged as we
expect 4Q shipment growth (116% YoY) to sequentially improve from 86% in
3Q We extrapolated our revised forecasts and as such we cut 4% of our 2022E
net profits which explained our lowered TP of RMB465 (from RMB500) We are
buy-rated but we prefer CR Beer (291HK Buy) and Mengniu (2319HK Buy)
within our China Consumer Staples coverage universe for a potentially lower
earnings volatility into the result seasons
 A steady 4Q top line Sales in liquid milk improved vs 3Q21 when IMF
continued to track strongly Based on Nielsen data Yilis market share in IMF
expanded 16ppt YoY to 71% in Nov 2021 despite regional outbreaks in the
country during the quarter Low temp milk recorded steady top line growth in
by the sector at the current stage given still limited scale high cold chain
logistic cost and the need of time to grow consumer habits
 4Q21 margins still under presssure 4Q21 margins went under relatively
selling expense ratio largely due to increased advertising campaigns
including those for Winter Olympics It is unlikely in our view to see significant
keep investing in emerging categories such as IMF low temp milk cheese
Management expected full-year NPM to improve by about 05ppt YoY
 Valuation Our TP is based on an updated 285x (from 290x) end-22E PE
which still represents 1sd above its 3-year average In our view our
methodology reflects Yilis solid growth roadmap which likely manifests into a
guided approximately 05ppt margins expansion per annum

Yili Industrial (600887 CH) NDR key takeaways
2022-to-date performance and some topics of major market interest
 A steady 4Q top line Sales in liquid milk improved vs 3Q21 IMF continued to track
strongly Based on Nielsen data Yilis market share in IMF expanded 16pp YoY to
71% in Nov 2021 despite regional outbreaks in the country during the quarter Low
temp milk recorded steady top line growth in the quarter but has not yet broken even
scale high cold chain logistic cost and the need of time to grow consumer habits
 4Q21 margins still under presssure 4Q21 margins went under relatively high
expense ratio largely due to increased advertising campaigns including those for Winter
Olympics It is unlikely in our view to see significant reduction in selling expense ratio
as IMF low temp milk cheese Management expected full year NPM expected to
improve by about 05pp YoY
 2022E outlook and longer-term targets Management guided for a healthy pace of
revenue growth in 2022E and to rank among the top 3 players globally by 2025E with
steady growth in liquid milk ，a 25% CAGR in IMF and high growth in smaller
margin expansion so as to achieve 9-10% NPM by 2025E Management also expects
the sector to see further consolidation going forward
 Cost pressure from raw milk price hike expect to ease in 2022E Raw milk price
increase decelerated in 4Q21 QoQ with the increase falling to LSD in Oct and Nov
2021 Management estimated raw milk price to record a HSD increase YoY for 2021
and expect the price to relatively stabilize at high levels in 2022E which should lead to
2022E after it has increased the prices of some SKUs in Jan and end 2021
 Development of IMF business and the strategic investment in Ausnutria The IMF
25% by 2025E before the strategic investment in Ausnutria According to management
it could even beat the target with synergies from Ausnutria in terms of supply chain
integration product extension (to other health care products) and channels expansion
Financial impact from the merger would be reflected in 2Q22 according to management
