rated with TP of RMB465 (unchanged)
of 3433% of equity stake in Ausnutria (1717HK not rated) for HK62bn
(including new issued shares) and became the latters largest single
shareholder Consensus estimates Ausnutria to generate RMB145bn net
profits for 2022E This implies the transaction will be 47% accretive for Yili
rank only behind Feihe
 We expect market share gain and sales mix upgrade to be major revenue
drivers for IMF players The number of new births in China saw sharp decline
YoY for two consecutive years in 2020 (-18%) and 2021 (-12%) with the total
number of new marriages in 2019-20 in continued decline YoY and Covid
vaccination to delay some parents decision to give birth In our view the
volume headwind is likely to extent into 2022-23 By then market share gain
and sales mix upgrade would be the key factors to sustain top line growth
 Enhanced consolidation leaves narrowing room for smaller players to
in high end goat milkcow milk products The tie up with Ausnutria would help
Yili to enhance its leading position through synergies in high-quality milk
sources channels and productbrand portfolios
provinces issued implementation measures since the release of the 3rd child
supportive policy in Jun 2021 These included cash subsidy maternity leave
