4Q21 tourist traffic (63% QoQ) recovered as we expected and so was CTGDFs
rally before the shares plunged further for the quarters aggressive discounts that
subsequently prompted a 10% cut in our 2021E earnings CTGDF management
pledged to uphold better margins for 2022 through disciplined promotions and a
Hainans 100bn sales target looks to be a setback that could again drag CTGDF
into the unhappy paradox between profitability and growth particularly
considering the current fluid travel outlook Separately the rising contribution
into a disruptor to managements plan The path to GPM recovery looks bumpy
to us and to reflect the augmenting ambiguities we downgrade CTGDF to HOLD
on a 29% cut in our 2022E earnings on back of a 73pp cut in GPM At c10%
below consensus our 2022E net profits reflects 1) a troughed GPM from 4Q21
which however remains lacklustre into 2022E and 2) a relatively flattish EBIT
margins to showcase managements execution efficiency to mitiagte the stagnant
GPM trajectory Meanwhile we also lower our target multiple to 365x end-22 PE
(from previously 490x) which is now rebased to -1sd below its 3-year average
We trim our TP to RMB 212 from RMB 350
Major earnings assumptions
RMB11bn contribution from Sunrise Shanghai Shanghai Airports and
RMB80bn from Hainan offshore operations For the latter the amount would
account for 80% of Hainans target largely in line with CTGDFs market
share on the island
We lowered our 2022E GPM to 316% (from 389%) based on 34% for duty-
free business and 26% for duty-paid business We still assume cosmetics
apparels to offer the highest GPM with the former at 40% followed by
watches jewelry at 30% while electronics offer the lowest at c10%
Cosmetics perfume will contribute to c50% of the sales mix followed by
c20% of electronics and the remaining from watches alcohol leather goods
Any supportive policies announcement espeically the easing of Chinas
zero-covid policy represent upside risks to our rating TPs In particular we
consider the relaxation on the purchase of imported necessities for Hainan
residents a trump card to help achieve the 100bn target

sustain CTGDFs leadership in Hainan
Following the favorable tax policy for tourists leaving Hainan to enjoy duty-free
shopping Hainans core duty-free sale channels have been captured by CTGDF
through the establishment of offshore duty-free stores throughout the island In 2014
China and the largest single duty-free store in the world in terms of total sales area
sales area CTGDF also operates duty-free stores with easy access in downtown
Haikou and the area of Boao Forum for Asia To stay in line with its marketing and
promotion strategy it has set up experience centers designed for different locations
such as resorts scenic spots and outlets in Hainan to let travelers experience the
products in person while offering the pick-up service when they depart Hainan
Together with two major airports in Hainan it has successfully set up a well-rounded
duty-free retail network
CTGDFs offshore duty-free stores offer Chinese tourists who usually visit overseas
duty-free stores another option In 2020 in view of the favorable government policies
and COVID-19 pandemic which caused significant decrease in international travel
activities its sales from offshore duty-free stores recorded a strong improvement In
2018 2019 and 2020 the revenue generated from offshore duty-free stores were
RMB80104mn RMB132496mn and RMB299619mn with a CAGR of 934%
In response to the duty-free shopping plus premium hotel project expansion of
Sanya International Duty-Free Complex is expected The duty-free shopping area has
an estimated GFA of 76500 sq m For hotel area its construction is targeted to start
sustain CTGDFs leadership in Hainan (currently 80% market share)

We await relaxation on purchase of imported necessities for Hainan residents
The next supportive policy announcement according to the Chinese government in
December 2020 relates to allowing duty-free shopping for Hainan onshore residents
(without departing Hainan) which we believe could be a pilot program ahead of the
tax exemption initiative for Hainan by 2025 According to Wind there are about 10mn
local residents in Hainan Assuming an annual luxury leisure spending of RMB1000
per capita that CTGDF could capture we estimate the relaxation should it realize
would represent a RMB10bn addressable market that CTGDF could explore
Domestic consumption repatriation
The 14th Five-Year Plan promotes a new development pattern that centers on the
domestic consumption circulation along with the co-development of an international
circulation The policy emphasizes the central role of the domestic consumption and
seeks to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the circulation with the aim of bringing
back overseas spending to sustain domestic economic growth According to CTGDF
total overseas duty-free spending by China tourists reached approximately RMB18tn
in 2019 with Korean Duty-free (KDFS) contributing to RMB1tn 55% of the total These
spending will be redirected to the domestic market we estimate this could boost the
market size of the latter by 33%

In fact with the relaxation of duty-free policy since Jul 2020 the total imports of
consumer goods grew 82% YoY to RMB16tn according to the China Custom
Jewelry and cosmetics offered the fastest growth of 30% followed by suitcase of 20%
This translated to RMB33bn duty-free spending for Hainan for the same year despite
travel restrictions amid the pandemic Given the ambition of reshaping Hainan to be a
tax-free port by 2025 domestic duty-free sales will remain a channel to repatriate
overseas consumption back to China

An aggressive online strategy
CTGDF took the initiative to develop its online platform It takes full advantage of the rise
of online shopping and creates a consistent customer engagement from the moment a trip
is planned and the moment the traveler returns home The international travel restrictions
since early 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has accidentally accelerated the
launch of the initiative Of note CTGDF has been fully engaged in online sales and
marketing through multiple online channels since Feb 2020 with new functions that include
but not limited to the followings
browsing and purchase histories CTGDF also organized livestreaming shows to
enable direct interaction between customers and KOLs
Customer services and customer loyalty program
The Company provided online chats and hotline support to respond to customer
enquiries An integrated customer loyalty program based on membership points was
also created via WeChat app

LNY tourist traffic recap
Touristic visitations revenue during 2022 LNY (131-26) still slightly declined by 2%
39% YoY It recovered to 739% 563% of 2019 level but was still relatively low amid
the major national holidays since Mid-Autumn and National Day in Oct 2020 though
higher than 2021 full year levels of 51% 54% This is likely because China has been
normalizing the opening of touristic attractions with over 70% of A-rated attractions in
the countries opened during LNY
The covid situation has been well managed in China where the covid control policy
the economy The surprising conditional approval of covid-19 drug by CFDA on 11
Feb 2022 also reflected Chinas willingness to accelerate the recovery process We
see scope for tourist traffic to trough in 2022
