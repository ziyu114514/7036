 2021 earnings beat Tigermed reported 2021 revenue of RMB5214mn up
beat our forecasts By segment revenue of Clinical Trial Solution (CTS)
jumped by 971% YoY to RMB2994mn in 2021 thanks to the continued
recovery from COVID-19 pandemic in China as well as the Companys active
involvement in COVID-19 MRCTs (multi-regional clinical trials) Gross profit
margin (GPM) declined to 436% in 2021 from 474% in 2020 due to RMB
appreciation a faster revenue growth of low-margin SMO (site management
organization) business and a higher portion of pass-through fees in revenue
related to COVID-19 MRCTs Management expects GPM to improve by 10-
15 ppts in 2022 assuming a relatively stable RMB in 2022 New orders in
2021 reached RMB9645mn up 742% YoY and total backlogs as of Dec
2021 amounted to RMB11405mn up 571% YoY both serving as solid
guarantees for Tigermeds future growth Proportion of revenue from COVID-
19 projects may decrease from 17% (around RMB900mn) in 2021 to 11%
(approximately RMB800mn) in 2022 according to our estimates
 Accelerated pace of globalization Despite a strong RMB Tigermeds
overseas revenue increased by 919% YoY in 2021 supported by strong
revenue growth from COVID-19 MRCTs We think Tigermed has utilized the
COVID-19 pandemic as an effective way to access overseas markets and to
showcase its global capabilities The Company had 50 ongoing MRCTs in its
2021 The significant increase in the number of MRCTs in 2H21 was mainly
driven by non-COVID projects which indicated the good client recognition of
will rely on Tigermeds global network for their overseas drug development
 The rapidly-expanding pipeline supports Tigermeds long-term growth
Total number of ongoing clinical projects was 567 as of Dec 2021 up by 46%
YoY (vs 11% YoY in 2020 and 22% YoY in 2019) The number of Ph12
projects delivered faster growth than late-stage projects forming a robust
base for future growth in late-stage projects Number of projects conducted
only in China also experienced a faster growth than that in overseas
and increasing reliance on clinical CRO in China
 Maintain BUY We cut our TP from RMB21259 to RMB18356 based on a 9-
year DCF model (WACC 984% terminal growth rate 30%) We forecast
grow 36%32%33% YoY in FY22E23E24E
