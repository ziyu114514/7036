BUY (Maintain)
(Previous TP
UpDownside
Maxscend (300782 CH) announced FY21 preliminary results FY21 net profit is
expected to grow 91-101% YoY to RMB205bn-2157bn implying  4Q21 net profit
of RMB576mn with 62% YoY and 12% QoQ growth Mid-point of FY21 earnings
is 2%1% above consensusour forecasts Excluding one-time gain of
RMB196mn FY21 adjusted net profit will be RMB187bn 81% YoY and 4Q21
adjusted net profit will be RMB361mn 9% YoY-30% QoQ Reiterate BUY
 Company delivered a quality earning to close FY21 despite tough macro
environment and extended COVID outbreak We noticed that 4Q adj NP
would decline 30% QoQ if excluding one-time gain Our view 1) Q4 is
continues to invest heavily in RD for future products 3) higher one-time loss
we may see another QoQ decline in 1Q22E considering 1Q21 high base due
to build-up inventory by OEMs during chip shortage
 In longer term we remain positive on Maxscend For FY22E catalysts for
the stock include 1) favorable product mix as module revenue will continue
growth with opportunities in top Android OEMs 2) launch of new
receivertransmitter modules 3) progress in new manufacturing plant
ongoing pilot production and initiation of small batch production later this year
 Maintain BUY with TP of RMB4500 Our TP is based on 50x FY22E PE
Maxscend is currently trading 1-SD below historical PE We believe this valuation
is attractive given 1) its leading position in Chinas RFFE market 2) broad in-house
designed product offerings and 3) transiting into fab-lite model to secure
production capacity and take full control of its manufacturing process We view
recent weakness in stock as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain
exposure to quality Chinese semi names that can ride strategic trends
lines and 3) further deteriorated Marco environment

Maintain BUY with TP of RMB4500 (42% upside)
We derive our TP of RMB4500 by applying 50x FY22 PE slightly above 2-year
historical average forward PE Maxscend is currently trading 1-SD below historical PE
which is very attractive We believe this valuation is justified given 1) its leading position in
Chinas RFFE market 2) broader product offerings which are all self-designed and 3)
transiting into fab-lite model to secure filter production and enhance its technology strength
We take the recent volatility as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain
exposure to quality Chinese semi fabless names that can ride strategic trends
Potential risks include 1) slower-than-expected RD progress and introduction of new
