1 Solid 3Q21 Cost pressure ahead 
28 Oct 2021 (Link)
HOLD (Down)
(Previous TP            RMB 3050)
UpDownside
Shengyi Tech announced FY21 preliminary results expecting FY21 net profit to
grow 56-73% YoY to RMB262bn-RMB290bn Mid-point of 4Q21 net profit is
expected to reach RMB421mn representing 11% YoY and -55% QoQ Mid-
point of FY21 result is 6%-9% below consensusour forecasts We lowered
FY21-22E EPS by 9% and adjusted TP to RMB2350 based on 19x FY22E PE
(vs previous 225x FY22E PE) Downgrade to HOLD
robust 9M21 growth of 44% YoY but 4Q21 earnings declined 55% QoQ
mainly due to weaker sales and lower GPM Looking forward we see slower
growth due to high base in FY21 and uncertainty in macro economy
 Resistance to transfer material cost pressure to downstream clients
The copper price has increased significantly in past year with 50% YoY
based on average daily close price LME 3M Copper price remains high
closed at US9846 per ton as of Jan 25 2020 We believe demand have
deteriorated due to prolonged period of increasing material costs Meanwhile
it also put pressure on GPM due to increasing difficulty to transfer the price
cost to downstream clients
 Bright spot on auto PCB Shengyis auto-related business accounted for
In 2021 auto sales had the highest order visibility and higher price upside
We expect the auto sales will continue to grow in 2022 driven by robust EV
market demand and continuous electrification
 Downgrade to HOLD and adjusted TP to RMB235 Our new TP of
RMB235 is based on lowered 19x FY22 PE (vs previous 225x due to
limited CCL ASP upside) Trading at 174x FY22E PE we think the valuation
is fair due to slower earnings growth in FY2223E Potential upsides include
continuing transferring of material costs and higher-than-expected market
demand Potential risks include less-than-expected transfer of material costs
and weaker market demand
