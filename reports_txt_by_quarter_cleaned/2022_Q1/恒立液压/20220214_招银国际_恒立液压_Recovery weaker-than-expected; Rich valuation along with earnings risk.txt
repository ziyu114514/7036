Jiangsu Hengli Hydraulic  Net
profit in 2Q21 down only 2%
YoY better than expectations 
SHSZ300  (rebased)
Henglis planned production volume remained relatively weak in Feb due to the
sluggish downstream demand and more time needed to digest the inventory of
hydraulic pump and valve We expect the recovery this year will likely be weaker
than expectations and we see downside risk to the consensus earnings We took
our earnings forecast in 2021E22E23E down by 6%12%13% to reflect our
more conservative assumptions on sales volume We think the current valuation
is rich at 33x 2022E PE We revised our TP down from RMB86 to RMB64 based
on 30x 2022E PE which is equivalent to the 3-year historical average (previous
target 42x 2021E PE) Maintain HOLD We will be more constructive if we see
(1) a meaningful recovery of pump  vales sales and (2) further progress in the
non-construction machinery areas similar to the agreement signed with Edwards
Vacuum (Qingdao) recently
 4Q21E earnings preview We forecast net profit to drop 30% YoY in 4Q21E
due to the overall weakness of sales volume which resulted in inventory build-
up for pump  valve We expect the full year net profit in 2021E to grow only
12% YoY to RMB25bn
 Production plan in Feb 2022 We expect Hengli has scheduled production
volume of 63k units of hydraulic cylinder (excavator) down 15% YoY
Scheduled production volume of pumpvalve drops 50%40% YoY as the
process of inventory clearance since 4Q21 has continued to affect the output
On the positive side we expect the planned production for non-standardized
cylinders in Feb to double YoY to 14k units due to a low base Besides the
planned volume of motor increases 60% YoY and 30% MoM driven by
AWP demand
 Share placement plan approved by CSRC in mid-Jan Hengli is eligible to
issue a maximum of 3916mn new shares (representing 23% of enlarged
share capital) The proceeds will be mainly spent on the capacity expansion
in Mexico (to support the global leading excavator manufacturer and the
Chinese customers in the US) Besides Hengli will construct new capacity for
linear actuator for electric cylinder (a new area that offers huge potential for
import substitution) From a longer-term perspective we remain positive to
Henglis new business initiatives given the excellent track record of achieving
import substitution
 Upside risks (1) Stronger recovery of excavator demand Downside risks
(1) weak recovery of construction activities (2) risk of overseas expansion

Earnings forecast in 2022E-23E
 We revised down the sales forecast of excavator hydraulic cylinder by 4% as
we believe further market share gain is less likely going forward (currently 50%
in China excavator market)
 We revised down our forecast on pump and valve substantially by 42% as we
expect it takes time to clear the inventory and the market share gain will slow
 We revised up the sales forecast on non-standardized cylinder as we expect
more applications in the non-excavator areas
 Hengli signed an agreement In Jan with Edwards Vacuum (Qingdao) 埃地沃
兹真空泵制造（青岛） Hengli will supply cast metals to Edwards for the
production of vacuum pump products applied in the semiconductor new
energy and medical industry (Edwards is a subsidiary of Atlas Copco Group
ATCOA SS a Sweden-based provider of industrial productivity solutions)
We estimate the revenue contribution to be RMB200mn this year (2% of
our revenue forecast in 2022E) and will gradually increase alongside the
industry We include this in our new estimates
