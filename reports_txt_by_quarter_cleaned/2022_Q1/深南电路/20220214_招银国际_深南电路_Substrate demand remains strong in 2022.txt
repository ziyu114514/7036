Shennan Circuits raised RMB255bn through a private placement on Thursday
and key participants include National IC industry Investment Fund The proceeds
will be used to expand high-end flip chip IC substrate manufacture Although we
think substrate demand will remain strong the new capacity will not contribute
much before end of 2023 In addition we believe the positive news have been
priced in and the stock is fairly valued Maintain HOLD with TP of RMB11075
 National IC Industry Investment Fund (Phase II) invested in Shennans
recent private placement Shennan Circuits raised RMB255bn through a
RMB10762 There are 19 participants including Huatai Securities National
IC industry Investment Fund JP Morgan Chase UBS etc The fund will be
used to expand Shennans capacity in high-end flip chip IC substrate
manufactures In 1H21 substrate business accounted for 19% of total
 IC substrate supply is expected to remain tight We saw substrate demand
was strong since last year as we pointed out in our previous reports Shennan
has announced new capacity in Guangzhou factory with planned capacity of
200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RFFC-CSP Looking forward we believe the
demand will remain strong BT substrate is expected to be tight at least in
1H22while the supply of ABF substrate will fall short throughout 2022
 Shennans current substrate capacity is under full production new
capacity will contribute in 202334E Shennans existing substrate capacity
has been in full production since 2020 driven by strong semiconductor
demand Current substrate capacity is 30w per year New substrate capacity
includes Wuxi Jiangsu and Guangzhou Guangdong
 Maintain HOLD with TP of RMB11075 Although we think substrate demand
new capacity will not contribute before end of 2023 As the positive news have
been priced in we think the stock is fairly valued at the moment Potential
upside risks include faster-than-expected decline of material costs higher-
than-expected 5G infrastructure spending and consumer demand
