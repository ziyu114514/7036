Willsemi announced preliminary results FY21 revenue grew 21% YoY to
RMB240bn in line with our estimate of RMB2447bn FY21 net profit was
RMB4468mn-RMB4868mn (65-80% YoY) Non-mobile CIS delivered significant
growth (auto 85% YoY and security 70% YoY) which confirmed our previous
forecast that non-mobile CIS will underpin future growth Reiterate BUY with TP
revised to RMB3330 to reflect continuous impact from global semi shortage
 FY21 revenue was in line with our estimate FY21 revenue grew 21% YoY
to RMB240bn (in line with our estimate of RMB2447bn) of which semi
business was RMB205bn (854% of total FY21 revenue vs 871% for FY20)
4Q21 revenue declined 3%3% YoYQoQ due to seasonality and weaker
smartphone sales of Android OEMs
 Significant growth in autosecurity CIS (85%70% YoY) confirmed our
view that non-mobile CIS will be the future growth driver Although mobile
CIS was negatively affected by weak Android smartphone sales we believe
high-end mobile CIS will continue outgrowing other categories in FY22 For
non-mobile CIS segment the revenue growth was significant Auto CIS grew
85% YoY to RMB23bn and security CIS grew 70% YoY In addition Willsemi
believe Willsemi will maintain its strong momentum in non-mobile CIS in FY22
 Breakthrough in touch and display business under tight global supply
Touch and display businesss revenue was RMB18bn growing at 160% YoY
due to global semi shortage Willsemi has started mass production of TDDI
products for key smartphone OEMs in FY21 We expect the tight supply will
OLED DDIC which could contribute additional revenue
 Reiterate BUY with new TP at RMB3330 based on 50x FY22E PE We
trimmed our forecast as the semi shortage is likely to stay longer than
expected this year New TP is based on same 50x FY22 PE Currently
Willsemi is trading at 338x FY22 PE and we believe the stock is attractive
Potential downside risks include 1) worse-than-expected global economy that
curbs consumer spending (ie continuous weaker Android smartphone sales)
and 2) unfilled demand caused by semi shortage
