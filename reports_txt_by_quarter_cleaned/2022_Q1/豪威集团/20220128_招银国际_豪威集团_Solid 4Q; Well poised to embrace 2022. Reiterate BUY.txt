Willsemi (603501 CH) announced FY21 preliminary results FY21 net profit is
expected to grow 65-80% YoY to RMB4468mn-RMB4868mn and mid-point of
implied 4Q21 net profit is expected to reach RMB1150mn representing 17%
YoY and -10% QoQ FY21 result is slightly higher than our forecasts by 03%
We remain positive on Willsemi and believe its non-mobile CIS business will
BUY with TP at RMB3466
 New products to gain market share in FY22E despite challenging
Android smartphone market in short term Apple became Chinas top
selling smartphone brand in 4Q21 for the 1st time since 2015 and there is
clear pressure on Android manufacturers Third party data indicated higher
Android smartphone inventory build-up and weaker-than-expected sell
through However we believe Willsemis mobile CIS can still gain share (in
RMB1k-2kRMB3k models) with its new 50MP100MP200MP products
 Non-mobile CIS will help to underpin Willsemis future growth We are
optimistic on Willsemis auto CIS sales The auto CIS experienced faster-than-
expected growth in 2021 and we expect the momentum would continue given
peers supply chain constraints The growth visibility in auto CIS is clearer due
to longer certification period for its peers Meanwhile ARVR market
opportunity and demand of security camera upgrade will also contribute
Oculus Quest 2 headsets has already exceeded 10 million since it launched
last October More importantly non-mobile CIS has high GPM and we expect
Willsemis profitability will improve due to favorable product mix
 Reiterate BUY with TP at RMB3466 based on 50x FY22E PE We reiterate
BUY rating on Willsemi with TP of RMB 34660 based on 50x FY22E PE We
believe this valuation is justified given 1) its leading position CIS market 2)
share gain in auto ARVR security CIS and 3) diversified product portfolio
Potential upsides include 1) better-than-expected global smartphone demand
and 5G adoption 2) new killer app released in VRAR that drives substantial
device sales Potential downside risks include 1) worse-than-expected global
economy that curbs consumer spending and 2) overhung chip shortage led to
unfilled demand
