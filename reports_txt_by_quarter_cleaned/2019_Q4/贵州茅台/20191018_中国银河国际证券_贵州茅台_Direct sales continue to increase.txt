Direct sales continue to increase
 Moutais distribution channel changes are on track the direct sales contribution
improved to 7% in 3Q19 from 41% in 1H19
 We expect the direct sales contribution to further increase in 4Q19F We also forecast
that FY19F net profit will grow 23% yoy
 We expect Moutai to supply 1Q20 volume to the market ahead of schedule to
maintain no further hikes in the current first-layer wholesaler price
 Maintain Add with an unchanged DCF-based TP of Rmb1328 (WACC10%)
Modest sales growth in 3Q19 but net profit growth in line
Moutais baijiu sales grew 14% yoy in 3Q19 a bit slower than the 18% yoy in 1H19 But
net profit grew 17% yoy in 3Q19 driven by a continuous mix upgrade an increase in
direct sales and better control of expenses Moutais 9M19 baijiu sales grew by 17% yoy
to Rmb61bn and its net profit was up by 23% yoy to Rmb305bn in line with our
expectations Moutais distribution network changes are still ongoing for the domestic
distributors channel Moutai has cut 616 Moutai brand distributors year to date to 2401
distributors and the direct sales channel build-up is on track The direct sales
contribution improved to 7% in 3Q19 from 41% in 1H19 We expect Moutai to accelerate
its supply volume to direct sales channels in 4Q19 and forecast that its FY19F net profit
will grow 23% yoy
Continually improving margin owing to a product structure upgrade
Moutais 9M19 gross profit margin was 915% up by 04%pt due to a product structure
upgrade Its sales tax was down by 2%pts to 13% The SD expenses ratio fell by
12%pts to 43% because of a decrease in the promotion of the Series brand Moutais
net profit margin improved by 26%pts to 50% in 9M19 With direct sales improving and
continuous upgrading of its product structure we expect Moutais profitability to further
improve in FY20F
Controlled price hikes to stimulate consumption
Moutai had direct sales of Rmb31bn in 9M19 its sales contribution improved to 51% in
9M19 from 41% in 1H19 In Sep 2019 Moutai increased its direct sales collaboration
hypermarkets  Wumart Sun Art and China Resources  and 400t to two online
platforms  Suning and Tmall Moutai also announced the advance supply of 4Q19
volume to its distributors These actions have had a positive impact in bringing down
Moutais first-tier wholesaler price in the distributors channel from a peak of Rmb2700
per bottle to Rmb22002300 per bottle now In 2020 Chinese New Year will be in Jan
slightly earlier than last year To satisfy high customer demand and stabilize its wholesale
price we expect Moutai to execute its 1Q20 supply volume ahead of schedule possibly
in 4Q19 which will benefit its Q419F sales growth
Maintain Add with an unchanged DCF-based TP of Rmb1328
We maintain our Add rating because of strong earnings growth driven by Moutais
channel reforms and a product mix upgrade Moutai is currently trading at 34x FY19F 17
sd above its historical average PE of 19x since listing Potential positive catalysts
including a potential ex-factory price hike in 2020 and margin improvement from the
increase in direct sales Downside risks include a reduction in high-end baijiu
consumption because of the worsening economic environment
