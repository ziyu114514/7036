ABC reported 9M19 net profit of RMB 1807bn up 53% YoY and accounting for
855%860% of CMBISconsensus full-year estimates In 3Q19 PPOP declined
(45% YoY) However the stronger-than-peers provision buffer enabled the
Bank to set aside less impairment charges (-149% YoY) and ensure a pick-up
in bottom-line earnings growth to 61% YoY (vs 49% YoY in 1H19) 9M19
annualized ROE fell 12ppts YoY to 146%
 Results positives 1) NIM widened 1bp QoQ by our estimate likely on
decent management in funding cost and adjustment in liability structure
ABCs market-based funding (incl interbank debt NCD) was up 55% in
3Q19 2) Loan growth remained healthy at 28% QoQ stronger than other
SOE banks that disclosed 3Q19 results so far Loans extended to county
area saw faster growth (31% QoQ) than that of total loans 3) Solid asset
quality trend The overall NPL ratio slid 1bp QoQ to 142% the 13th
consecutive quarterly decline In particular NPL ratio of county area banking
business fell 7bps QoQ to 175% Provision coverage climbed 29ppt QoQ to
2813% the highest among Big-4 banks offering greater room to reduce
credit cost 4) Capital adequacy improved CET1tier-1total CAR edged up
by 6bps83bps62bps QoQ to 1119%1250%1610% following the RMB
120bn perpetual bonds issuance
 Results negatives 1) 3Q19 revenue declined 02% YoY as trading and
investment return dropped 40% YoY due to decrease in net gain on principal
largely stable 3) 3Q19 opex rose 45% YoY leading to a higher CIR of
327% 3) Deposits growth was soft at 10% QoQ slower than loan growth
thus LDR rose 12ppts to 712%
 Maintain BUY and raise TP to RMB 51 ABC-A currently trades at 074x
FY19E PB similar to its past 5-year mean of 075x We kept our earnings
forecast unchanged and rolled forward the valuation basis to FY20 Our new
RMB 51 TP is derived from 094x target PB and FY20E BVPS of RMB 54
