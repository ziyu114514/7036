Strong execution ability to drive long-term growth
 3Q19 sales grew 27% yoy with net profit up 35% yoy both stronger than we
expected driven mainly by ASP and volume growth from new Wuliangye launches
 Wuliangye has proven to the market that its brand image and distribution network
have consistently improved this year
 We forecast that Wuliangye will continue to deliver 18% yoy sales growth in FY20F
 Maintain Add with new DCF-based TP of Rmb165
Successful launch of new Wuliangye led to strong 3Q19 results
Wuliangye achieved 27% yoy sales growth to Rmb37bn in 9M19 and its net profit was up
by 31% yoy to Rmb12bn Of which 3Q19 sales grew by 27% yoy to Rmb10bn with net
profit up by 35% yoy to Rmb32bn both stronger than market and our estimates We
believe the strong growth was mainly due to successful launch of 8th generation
Wuliangye in June 2019 which drove up both ASP and volume growth in 3Q19 We
estimate that 20300t of the high-end Wuliangye brand were sold 20300t in 9M19 and
c5000t of the new generation Wuliangye sold in 3Q19 78% of our estimate for FY19F
As at the end of 3Q19 advance payments from customers had risen 140% yoy and 35%
qoq to Rmb 59bn reflecting strong advance stocking demand from distributors to
prepare for Chinese New Year The first-tier wholesaler price of 52Wuliangye currently
remains at Rmb930940 per bottle higher than Rmb840-850 per bottle in the beginning
Margin improvement through product structure premiumization
The 3Q19 GPM was up by 27%pts to 604% mainly because of product structure
premiumization We expect the GPM to improve by 15%pts yoy in FY19F As Wuliangye
launched a large marketing campaign for new Wuliangye products in 3Q19 the SD
expenses ratio increased by 22%pts but was partially offset by good control of GA
expenses Its 3Q19 net profit margin improved by 18%pts to 322% We forecast that
FY19F net profit will grow by 30% yoy to Rmb174bn with net profit margin expansion of
14%pts to 348%
Sales growth expected to remain strong in FY20F
Since 2019 Wuliangye has made clear marketing strategy to strengthen Wuliangye
brand image and concentrate on its high-end Wuliangye brand particular on its star
product -52Wuliangye  On the other hand Wuliangye has been outspoken to stabilize
their distribution network and protect its distributors with a reasonable channel profit
Driven by a continuous product mix upgrade and channel reform we expect Wuliangye
will achieve 178% and 165% yoy sales growth in FY20F and FY21F respectively
Maintain Add with a higher DCF-based TP of Rmb165
We revised up FY19F21F EPS by 11%17% reflecting Wuliangyes stronger-than-
expected sales growth and successful product structure premiumization We maintain our
ADD rating for Wuliangye as the current management team has a clear strategy to
further improve the Wuliangye brand image and strong execution ability in reforming its
distribution network Downside risks include 1) a significant fall in Moutais average retail
price capping Wuliangyes price increase potential and 2) a macroeconomic slowdown
which would have a heavy negative impact on super-premium baijiu consumption
Positive catalysts include 1) stronger-than-expected volume growth and 2) better
expense ratio control
