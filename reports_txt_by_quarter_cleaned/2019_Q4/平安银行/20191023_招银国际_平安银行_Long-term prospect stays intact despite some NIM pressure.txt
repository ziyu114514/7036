PAB reported 9M19 earnings of RMB 236bn up 155% YoY and accounting for
828%840% of CMBISconsensus full-year estimates 3Q19 net profit picked
up 160% YoY accelerating from 152% YoY in 1H19 Revenue growth stayed
high-base effect The Bank boosted impairment charges (218% YoY) for more
stringent NPL recognition As such 9M19 annualized ROE edged up 4bps YoY
to 1264% despite a dilution impact from CB conversion
 Results positives 1) Loan growth was healthy at 33% QoQ on the back
of faster expansion of retail loans (40% QoQ) vs corporate loans (24%
QoQ) The proportion of retail loans reached 592% as of 3Q19 Meanwhile
number of retail and private banking client grew steadily by 38% QoQ and
strong fees from settlement and agency service businesses 3) Asset
quality remained stable NPL ratio was flat at 168% while above 90day
overdue loan ratio fell 12bps QoQ to 146% implying stricter NPL
recognition Credit cost rebounded to 32% and provision coverage climbed
37ppts to 1862% 4) Capital position was strengthened post CB
conversion CET 1 and total CAR rose 87bps74bps QoQ to 975%
1336% The Bank has proposed to issue RMB 50bn perpetual bonds which
could further boost Tier 1 CAR by 196bps
 Results negatives 1) NIM narrowed 9bps QoQ to 262% as loan yields
retreated 19bps QoQ on possibly more prudent credit allocation while
funding cost was largely stable 2) Deposit balance shrank 23% QoQ
after a decent 102% HoH growth in 1H19 CBIRCs tightened regulation on
structured deposits may restrain PABs deposit growth as its proportion of
structured deposit was 185% as of 2Q19
 Maintain BUY and raise TP to RMB 212 We see muted share price
reaction after the mixed 3Q19 results However we remain upbeat on PABs
long-term outlook given the Banks in-depth retail transformation and market-
oriented business strategy We lifted our FY19-21 earnings forecast by 3-10%
and rolled forward the valuation basis to FY20 Our new RMB 212 TP is
derived from 135x target PB and FY20E BVPS of RMB 157
