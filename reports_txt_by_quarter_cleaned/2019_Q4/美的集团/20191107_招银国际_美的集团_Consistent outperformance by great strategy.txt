6 Nov 2019
A solid 3Q19 for Midea consists of 1) remarkable market shares gain in AC 2)
consumer electronic segment recovery and 3) favorable input costs and FX rate
Thanks to positive outlook in 2H19E we maintain BUY and raised TP to RMB
7533 based on 18x FY20E PE (from 16x) or 13x PEG (vs peers avg of 18x)
 3Q19 net profit up 23% solid beat Mideas net profit att increased by 23%
YoY 10% above BBGs est backed by 6% YoY sales growth noted that
consolidation of Little Swan accounted for 4% NP att growth GP margin
expanded by 07ppt in our view helped by 1) RMB depreciation 2) softening
raw material prices and 3) greater sales from high-end products series (eg
COLMO Midea PRO etc) Opex  as % of total sales also recorded a saving
 AC sales slowed down consumer electronics quicken up robotics and
automation stabilized Even though AC sales growth slowed down to just
5% in 3Q19 (vs 12% in 1H19) it was still far better than the industry where
both volume and ASP had fallen by 3% and 5% (offline) 10% (online)
according to China IOL and AVC implying solid market shares gain thanks
to successful new product launches in FY19E Sales growth of consumer
electronics in 3Q19 accelerated to 10% (vs 6% in 1H19) driven mostly by
strong recovery of washing machines by 12% (vs 6% in 1H19) and small
appliances by 13% (vs low single digit in 1H19) plus the improved exports
sales (helped by favorable FX) Sales growth of robotic and automation was
a small negative in 3Q19 (vs -4% in 1H19) on track to resume growth while
EBIT margin also rose to 43% (vs 31% last year) by effective costs control
 Remains confident on sales growth and margin expansions in 2H19E
The Company maintained its targets of a 5-10% sales growth in FY19E a mild
GP margin expansion and a stable opex ratio It also expect online sales to
accounted for 35% of total retail sales (CMBI est 38% of group sales)
(targeting 1000 now at 500) and flagship stores (targeting 1900)
 Maintain BUY and raised TP to RMB 7533 (27% upside) We lifted FY19E
20E 21Es net profit by 26% 31% 28% to factor in 1) favorable input costs
and currency rate and 3) greater efficiency gain Our new TP is based on 18x
FY20E PE (lifted from 16x FY20E thanks to picked up in NP growth) The
counter now trades at 16x 14x FY19E 20E PE or 10x 3 years PEG
