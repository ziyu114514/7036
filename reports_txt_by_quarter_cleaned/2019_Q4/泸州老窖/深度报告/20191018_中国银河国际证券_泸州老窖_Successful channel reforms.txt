Successful channel reforms
 We like Luzhou Laojiao for its successful distribution channel reforms strong
profitability improvement and potential ASP hike for its star brand  Cellar 1573
 We forecast a 27% EPS CAGR in FY1821F driven by a 23%24% sales CAGR from
its high-end and mid-range product segments respectively
 We initiate with an Add rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122 (WACC96%)
New distribution network starting to reap benefits
Since 2015 Laojiao has taken four years to restructure its distribution network providing
stronger market support for its distributors and restoring its high-end brand image Now
Laojiao has around 3000 distributors with over 8000 of its own salespeople Its brand
value rose by 40% yoy to US53bn in 2019 according to Brand Finance Backed with
this strong distribution network we expect Laojiaos channel reforms to start to bear fruit
and its sales to grow at a 19% CAGR in FY1821F We also expect its high SD
expenses ratio of 26% in 2018 to gradually fall back by 5%pts to 21% in 2021F leading
to OPM expansion of 84%pts from 342% in FY18 to 424% in FY21F
Product portfolio premiumization to capture consumption upgrade
Laojiaos product structure has been continually been upgraded Its high-end baijiu (ie
Cellar 1573) sales grew rapidly by 37% yoy to Rmb64bn  accounting for 50% of baijiu
sales in FY18 while its middle-range baijiu was up by 28% yoy to Rmb37bn contributing
22% of sales Laojiao has gradually lifted its retail selling price (RSP) YTD because of
major products has risen by 7% to 38% YTD and Laojiao has successfully captured the
consumption upgrade trend
ASP hike could be a near-term catalyst
Laojiaos price strategy is closely pegged with that of Wuliangye which successfully
increased its ex-factory price by 126% through launching the 8th generation of Wuliangye
in June 2019 We expect Laojiao to follow Wuliangye increasing its ex-factory price of
Cellar 1573 in the near future Meanwhile due to a supply shortage of premium baijiu in
the RSP range of Rmb10002000bottle we expect Cellar 1573 to ramp up by 7%
volume CAGR and 15% ASP CAGR in FY1821F
Initiate coverage with an Add rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122
We initiate coverage on Laojiao with an ADD rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122
(WACC 96%) implying 38x31x FY19F20F PE Laojiao is currently trading at 27x
FY19F PE 20 sd above its historical average of 19x since its listing in 2009 In the
past Laojiaos valuation was largely in line with or slightly below the industry average
We believe that Laojiao deserves to trade at premium vs its peers owing to a potential
ASP hike for its super-premium Cellar 1573 products and strong sales growth
momentum boosted by its profit-sharing distribution model Downside risks are as
follows 1) over 67% of its sales are derived from its top five customers which indicates
the key distributors have strong bargaining power and influence on Laojiaos distribution
channels which might be a tail risk in the long term and 2) a macroeconomic slowdown
may affect super-premium baijiu consumption

Successful channel reforms
above Rmb1000 per bottle after Wuliangye
In the current new growth cycle of the China baijiu sector starting from 2018
with the consumption upgrade trend top tier brand Moutai increased its retail
selling price (RSP) of 53Feitian MT to Rmb2700 per bottle from Rmb1499
per bottle This has triggered strong customer demand for other baijiu products
with a strong brand name but a more reasonable RSP in the range of
Rmb10002000 per bottle in the super premium baijiu market In Jun 2018
another top-tier baijiu brand Wuliangye successfully launched its new 52
Wuliangye on the market with an RSP of Rmb10001300 per bottle from the
previous Rmb920950 per bottle Wuliangye has partially filled in the price gap
for the RSP range of Rmb10002000 per bottle through this product upgrade
Wuliangye increased its ex-factory price from Rmb789bottle to Rmb889bottle
up 13% We expect total sales volume of  52Wuliangye to reach 18000
tonnes in 2019F up 15% YoY
We believe Luzhou Laojiao (Laojiao) can raise its ex-factory price after
Wuliangyes price increase supported by its strong brand name and sufficient
production capacity for Cellar 1573 Currently the ex-factory price for Laojiao
Cellar 1573 is Rmb780bottle with a first-layer wholesale price of Rmb820bottle
and an RSP of Rmb919bottle We expect Laojiaos sales to grow at a 19%
CAGR from Rmb13bn in 2018 to Rmb22bn in 2021F driven mainly by ASP
improvement through product upgrades and volume growth

Laojiao Cellar 1573 brand with strong revenue resilience
cellars 1619 of which are more than 100 years old The oldest ones can be
traced back to the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty in 1573 AD
high-end Cellar 1573 (国窖1573) product in Jan 2001 This was followed by a
large marketing campaign to promote and strengthen its Laojiao brand among
consumers as one of the top high-end brands
The strategy was quite successful as Laojiao achieved a 23% sales CAGR in
20002012 58%pts higher than Wuliangyes 17% CAGR Laojiao also
gradually raised its ex-factory price of Cellar 1573 from Rmb268 per bottle in
2002 to Rmb889 per bottle in 2012 and in 2012 the RSP of Cellar 1573
reached Rmb1389 per bottle in the end consumer market 25% higher than 52
Wuliangyes RSP of Rmb1109 per bottle at the time In the last baijiu growth
cycle we think Laojiao successfully built up its high-end brand image nationwide
and established a solid customer base for long-term market development
However in the 201315 baijiu sector restructuring period Laojiao management
misjudged the negative impact on high-end baijiu consumption of the
governments anti-corruption measures and implemented an inappropriate
marketing strategy to cope with oversupply in the baijiu market eventually
Laojiaos sales declined at a 16% CAGR in 201215 and sales volume of the
high-end Cellar 1573 brand slumped from a peak of over 4000 tonnes in 2012
to a trough of about 900 tonnes in 2014
Since it is a popular high-end baijiu brand Laojiao exhibited strong earnings
recovery during the 201617 baijiu recovery period After consistently adjusting
its pricing strategy to cope with market demand and stabilizing its first-tier
wholesale price and retail selling price Laojiao recovered with a 23% sales
CAGR in 201517 much faster than its peers Wuliangye had a sales CAGR of
18% and Yanghe 11% In the new baijiu growth cycle since 2018 Laojiao
continued its strong sales growth of 26% yoy in 2018 and 25% yoy in 1H19
while Wuliangye grew by 33% yoy in 2018 and 27% in 1H19 and Yanghe

Now the RSP of Laojiaos high-end brand  Cellar 1573  is about Rmb919 per
bottle in last baijiu growth cycle in 2012 After reviewing Laojiaos ex-factory
price increase on Cellar 1573 since 2014 we found its pricing strategy closely
followed that of Wuliangye In Jun 2019 Wuliangye raised its ex-factory price of
52Wuliangye from Rmb789 to Rmb889 per bottle through product upgrades
and eventually its RSP stabilized at Rmb10001300 per bottle We think it is
likely for Laojiao to increase its ex-factory price by upgrading Cellar 1573 and
closely monitoring its channel inventory supported by its high brand recognition
and reasonable sales volume

Successful distribution channel reforms
Laojiao restructured its distribution model and strengthened
The disadvantage of Laojiaos region-oriented model emerged during the baijiu
adjustment cycle in 20132014 because of the lack of immediate market
information on consumer demand Laojiao also had less power to control
channel inventory and could not react quickly to market  demand changes So
when market demand fell Laojiao unexpectedly increased the ex-factory price of
its star product  Cellar 1573  from Rmb889 to Rmb999 per bottle in Aug 2013
and increased supply to its distributors As a result Laojiaos products flooded
its distribution channels and its first-tier wholesaler price and retail price fell off
the cliff in the 201314 baijiu adjustment period seriously impacting Laojiaos
distribution network
high channel inventory and renew distributors faith in Laojiao First Laojiao cut
its ex-factory price from Rmb999 to Rmb560 per bottle in Jul 2014 Second in
Sep 2014 Laojiao suspended supply to its distributors to give them more time to
clear out inventory To accelerate destocking and help channel inventory revert
to a normal level in Feb 2015 Laojiao implemented a cash buy-back scheme to
buy back Cellar 1573 inventory in distributors hands at Rmb550 per bottle with
an Rmb20 incentive to further clear channel inventory and strengthen its
distributor relationship These moves were considered to be quite effective and
helped build a solid foundation for Laojiaos later rapid recovery
In June 2015 Laojiao formed a new management team led by Liu Miao the
chairman and Lin Feng the CEO Both came from a marketing background with
over two decades working experience in Laojiaos sales team They gradually
restructured Laojiaos distribution network and transformed it to a brand-oriented
model The layout structure looks similar to the previous region-oriented model
But a detailed analysis of the brand-oriented model shows that Laojiao has
better channel control through individual brand management and distributors
have less autonomy because since 2014 Laojiao has continually expanded its
sales team from c1400 sales persons in 2014 to over 8000 now concentrating
on product promotion and new market development

Compared with Moutai and Wuliangyes general wholesale model and Yanghes
go-to-market model Laojiaos model may have some potential tail risks in the
long term The revenue contribution from its top five customers is considerably
higher than that of its peers about 67% in 2018 whereas Wuliangyes was 11%
and Moutai and Yanghe were both about 5% So the bargaining power of
Laojiaos top five distributors is relatively strong This might not be a big issue
when the baijiu industry is in a growth period since the interests of Laojiao and
its distributors will be well aligned to seek maximum sales growth through a
stronger brand image market development etc Distributors will consistently
follow Laojiaos guidance on marketing strategies However if there is a
downturn in the baijiu industry the disadvantage of top five distributors strong
between large and small distributors and steps taken by large distributors in
reaction to a sector downturn that are not in line with Laojiaos interests

Distributors supported Laojiaos fast growth in the last baijiu
From 2006 to 2014 Laojiao applied a region-oriented model to encourage its
key regional distributors and sales people to set up in their respective operating
territories At the time Laojiao acted as a pure baijiu manufacturer and all
product promotion and market expansion responsibilities were delegated to its
distributors The distributors received a wide range of incentives and helped
Laojiao grow rapidly at a 35% sales CAGR in 200612 the last baijiu growth
cycle Its high-end baijiu products were well promoted to consumers by its
distributors and the revenue contribution from baijiu sales improved by 12% to
67% in 2012 from 55% in 2006
Currently Laojiaos channel profit is lower than Wuliangyes
The retail price of Laojiaos star product  52Cellar 1573  has rebounded back
estimated at Rmb140 per bottle with around a 51% distributor GP margin 18%
lower than Wuliangyes 69% mainly because Wuliangye successfully increased
its ex-factory price and the overall pricing system through product upgrades
Profit-share model with distributors

 Distributor network is flattened

 Wholesalers are entirely resposible for
marketing promotion and distribtution in their

 Yanghe develops new markets for distributors
and takes charge of brand promotion product

 Distributors are responsible for basic functions
such as market management logistics warehouse
and cash flow in their respective territories
 Front-line salespeople are managed and
evaluated by Yanghe using the Amoeba operating
Distributors
 Laojiao earn fairly low margins as it need take
charge of marketing related expenses and sales
team build-up in the early stage
 Wholesalers have strong bargaining power and
earn high channel distribution margins
 As each party in the wholesaler pyramid model
frequently offer discounts and promotions to
retailers and consumers
 Distributors have small bargaining power and
earn fairly low channel distribution margins
 Laojiao has strong control of channel inventory
through controlling the supply volume in each sales
 Laojiao has the ability to coordinate its sales
interactions via production and marketing strategies
 Laojiao gets direct feedback from its end-
customers enabling it to evaluate the effectiveness
of its marketing strategy and tailor its development of
new products to consumer interests
 Wholesalers have sufficient cash flow and
established local distribution networks to achieve
rapid and extensive coverage in many cities at low
 The baijiu manufacturer (eg Yanghe) has
access to valuable and targeted point-of-sale
information that enables it to make intelligent
decisions about pricing  promotions and shelf
  Yanghe can easily to promote a new and small-
volume SKUs in Yanghes own distribution
 Requires huge investment to build the distribution
network which can only be justified for brands with
large scale and high profit margins
 Lack of assistance from local distributors at the
early stage makes it difficult to penetrate the regional
market given the high barriers to entry built by local
information about product sales pricing and
distribution as it is difficult to track wholesalers
sales to products to retailers Such information (on
consumer purchasing behaviour demographics)
could help the baijiu manufacturers to better
through the channels which could easily cause
wholesalers to hold too much inventory
 The wholesalers tend to focus on high-volume
products and neglect new small -volume SKUs
 Baijiu manufacturer must invest significant
human resources and capital to build its own
distribution network to reach target customers

Margin expansion as a catalyst
Laojiao reclassified its baijiu categories based on its brand name in 2013 all
products under Cellar 1573 are in the premium segment the Cellar Age and
Tequ brands are in the mid-range segment and the Touqu and Er Qu brands
are in the low-end segment
Gross profit margin expansion driven by product portfolio
see a clear product structure upgrading trend in Laojiaos baijiu sales Its
premium baijiu grew at a 17% sales CAGR in 201318 and its sales attribution
improved by 21% from 28% in 2013 to 50% in 2018 Mid-range sales grew
relative slowly at a 3% sales CAGR in 201318 with sales attribution declining
from 32% in 2013 to 29% in 2018 Low-end sales fell by a 7% CAGR with its
contribution reduced from 40% in 2013 to 22% in 2018 We expect Laojiaos
product portfolio to continue its premiumization trend and for its premium baijiu
capacity expansion In 2019F21F we expect Laojiaos GPM to improve by 2%
from 78% in 2018 to 80% in 2021F
Second Laojiao started to expand its capacity in 2016 Phase One involves the
construction of about 7000 new cellars (around 35kt capacity) for base liquor
management the new capacity will free some of the older cellars which are
currently used for low-end products to produce liquor for the Cellar 1573 brand
and Cellar Age brand Laojiao estimates that the production capacity of Cellar
1573 will grow to 15000 tonnes in 2020F and 25000t in FY25F (2018 7000

EBITDA margin improvement driven by better control of
Compared with Wuliangye and Yanghes EBITDA margin breakdown analysis
Laojiaos EBITDA margin was 35% in 2018 11% and 12% lower than
Wuliangyes and Yanghes respectively mainly because Laojiaos SD
expenses ratio was 26% 17% and 15% higher than Wuliangyes and Yanghes
In 2001 Laojiao launched its star brand  Cellar 1573  and put a large effort
into establishing brand awareness among consumers therefore its SD
expenses ratio immediately jumped by 6% to 23% in 2001 from 17% in 2000
This high SD expenses ratio remained until Laojiao adopted its profit-sharing
model with its distributors in 2006 Its SD expenses ratio gradually declined to
6% in 2012 In the baijiu adjustment period (201314) and baijiu recovery period
(201517) Laojiao continued to dedicate a large investment to its distribution
network reconstruction We think Laojiaos large-scale input in the distribution
earnings growth in 2018 and 40% earnings growth in 1H19 despite the fact that
its SD expenses ratio remained at relatively high level Its distribution channel
cost input has entered the optimization stage as cost effectiveness and
efficiency will gradually improve and its SD expenses ratio should steadily
decline thus improving its net profit margin We estimate that Laojiaos net profit
margin will improve by 6%pts from 27% in FY18 to 33% in FY21F

We initiate coverage on Laojiao with an ADD rating and DCF-based TP of
Rmb122 (WACC 96%) implying 38x31x FY19F20F PE Laojiao is currently
trading at 27x FY19F PE 20 sd above its historical average of 19x since its

We think Laojiao deserves trading at premium supported by its potential ex-
factory price hike on its super-premium Cellar1573 products continuous mix
upgrade and margin expansion Since early 2019 Moutais retail selling price
has remained at Rmb20002900 per bottle This has led to strong customer
demand for premium baijiu products with a strong brand name and an RSP
range of Rmb10002000 per bottle We believe Laojiao is the most suitable
name to fit in this price range together with Wuliangye We expect Laojiao and
its distributors to seize this chance to rapidly expand into the super-premium
baijiu market
Meanwhile we expect Laojiaos profitability to significantly improve owing to 1)

Oldest cellars in China
Luzhou Laojiao (泸州老窖)positioned itself as cellar age baijiu specialist in the
the older the cellar the more the microbes multiply the more fragrant the baijiu
Laojiao has over 10086 cellars 1619 of which are more than 100 years old
The oldest ones can be traced back to the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty in
Figure 23 Laojiaos cellars with over 600 kinds of microbes

Besides its star brand  Cellar 1573  targeting the super-premium baijiu market
(RSP Rmb600bottle) in 2010 Laojiao launched another brand  Cellar Age 
with an RSP of Rmb250600 per bottle depending on its production cellar age
which is aimed at the premium baijiu market (RSP of Rmb300600bottle) Sales
of Cellar Age products reached Rmb2bn in 2018 accounting for 15% of total
As Figure 25 shows there is a certain market overlap between the Cellar Age
brand and the Tequ brand For the mid-range baijiu consumption market (RSP
of Rmb100300bottle) Laojiao does not have a distinctive brand Its Touqu and
Er Qu brands are obviously aimed at the low-end baijiu market (RSP
Rmb100bottle)
Sales of Laojiaos low-end product segments declined by a 7% CAGR in 2013
18 We think Laojiaos current brand management strategy is to underpin its
premium and super-premium brand recognition in less penetrated markets such
as eastern and southern China Sales volume for the low-end product segment
is expected to fall moderately with an ASP hike

Industry overview and outlook
Rising sales volume to drive growth of premium baijiu market
We expect sales volume of low-end baijiu to continue to decline but sales
volume of the premium and super premium segments to grow rapidly driven by
consumption upgrades and premiumization For the premium baijiu segments
the first-tier wholesale price for key premium products such as Moutai
Wuliangye and Cellar 1573 have risen since 2016 through either product mix
upgrades or ex-factory price hikes We expect rising sales volume and an ASP
increase to be the key drivers for premium baijiu market growth in 2019F
Figure 30 First-tier wholesale price growth on an upward trend
SOURCES CGIS RESEARCH COMPANY DATA BLOOMBERG
According to Euromonitor the premium and super premium baijiu segments will
expand by a sales CAGR of 7% and 11% respectively in 201721F while the
low-end segment will see sales contract by an 11% CAGR over the same period

Premium baijiu market expected to consolidate further
The super premium baijiu market in China is highly concentrated dominated by
Moutai Wuliangye Luzhou Laojiao and Yanghe We estimate that Moutai had a
market share of over 60% of the super premium baijiu segment in 2017 based
the capability to challenge Moutais dominant market position in the near term
But the premium baijiu market is more fragmented Apart from national brands
certain regional brands are also popular According to Euromonitor sales value
of the top five premium brands accounted for 57% of total premium baijiu sales
in 2017 We expect the premium baijiu market to consolidate further with
leading players with high brand recognition flat and wide distribution networks
and strong management execution ability (such as Yanghe) to gain market

continuous urbanization and a rising middle class 2) an increasing proportion of

consumption in the premium baijiu segment to continue to rise in the long run
mainly because of the following
High net worth households driving consumption upgrades The number of
high net worth households with investable assets above US1m in China
continues to expand and the number is expected to rise by an estimated 2016
21F CAGR of 13% to 4m by 2021F in tandem with investable assets growth of
15% CAGR to Rmb111tr by 2021F based on the Boston Consulting Group
(BCG) research report titled China private banking 2017 These households
are expected to contribute significantly to the premium and super premium baijiu
markets as the philosophy of drinking less but drinking better has continued to
influence the behaviour of Chinese consumers particularly upper-middle and
Based on BCGs estimates the new generation of consumers aged 18 to 35 will
contribute consumption expenditure of US26tr in 2021F from US15tr in 2016
likely surpassing the consumer group aged over 35 and will account for
US24tr in 2021F vs US19tr in 2016 We conducted a market survey of
Chinas baijiu sector in Nov 2018 with 532 participants According to our market
survey the primary consumers of baijiu are between 30 and 50 However our
with consumers aged 20 to 30 years and those below 20 starting to drink baijiu
About 45% of respondents between 20 and 30 said they drink baijiu

Financial review and outlook
Ongoing product premiumization to boost margins
In 1H19 Laojiao recorded 25% yoy sales growth to Rmb80bn with net profit up
by 40% yoy to Rmb28bn These result were attributed mainly to strong sales
growth of its premium and mid-range baijiu segments which grew by 30% and
35% respectively on a yoy basis Its low-end baijiu segment maintained flattish
07% yoy sales growth As a result the revenue contribution from the premium
and mid-range segments grew 2%pts to 54% and 2%pts to 28% respectively
while the low-end segment shrank by 4%pts to 17% in 1H19
Because Laojiaos product structure focused on premiumization its GPM
excluding sales tax improved by 48%pts to 80% in 1H19 The GA expenses
ratio declined by 1% which was wholly offset the impact of SD expenses rising
by 06%pt The net profit margin was up by 37%pts to 34% in 1H19

Earnings expected to grow at a 27% CAGR in 201821F
We forecast that Laojiaos sales will grow at a CAGR of 19% in 201821F
driven mainly by Laojiaos baijiu product structure upgrading We expect sales of
its high-end brand  Cellar 1573  to grow at a 23% CAGR in 201821F driven
by a 15% ASP hike and 7% volume growth We expect sales of its mid-range
brands  Cellar Age and Tequ  to rise by a 24% CAGR in 201821F driven by
18% volume growth and a 5% ASP hike For its low-end brands we expect
sales volume to continue to shrink by a 4% CAGR and its ASP to rise by a 5%
CAGR in 201821F sales of low-end brands should retain flattish at a 1% sales
CAGR in 201821F We expect Laojiaos gross profit margin to improve by
23%pts to 798% in 2021F from 775% in 2018
reconstruction over the past few years and costs related to channel changes
should fall accordingly We estimate that Laojiaos SD expenses ratio will
gradually decline by 5%pts from 26% in 2018 to 21% in 2021F and the operating
leverage increase to bring down the GA expense ratio by 13%pts to 47% in

Macroeconomic slowdown Chinas baijiu consumption structure has changed
Managers Index (PMI) deteriorates consumer confidence could be hit
dampening consumption of baijiu products Cellar 1573 is targeting the super-
premium baijiu consumption market with an RSP above Rmb600 per 500ml unit
Weaker economic conditions could have a negative impact on demand
Government policy changes In 2001 the Chinese government adjusted the
consumption tax for the baijiu industry resulting in a higher tax burden for baijiu
for the liquor could be adversely affected
Directors are appointed by the government Board stability may be shaken by
political risk

2 have over 6% market share in the super- premium
baijiu market based on our estimates
3 The strong cash position will give Laojiaos strong
ability to perform any large MAs and consolidate its
market position in the baijiu industry
1 Laojiao is controlled by government and exposure by political
policy such as the price hike which needs to be proved by
government firstly
2 Laojiao has over 67% sales revenue derived from top five
customers These distributors have strong bargain power on the
distribution channel If the economic environment get worsen it
may not have sufficient incentive for distributors to follow
Laojiaos operation guidance
1 China baijiu industry are in the progress of
consolidation on the premium segment The market size
of premium segment will grow at a 12% CAGR of FY17-
20F based on Euromonitor estimates
2 Under the strong Cellar1573 brand umbrella we
expect the sales growth in its Cellar Age products would
accelerate
1 In the consumption upgrade trend Wuliangye has successfully
upgraded its star product and received strong feedback from
customer ends Laojiaos Cellar1573 has not upgraded since it
launched to market in 2001 Cellar1573 sales might slow down
and  lose some market shares in the super-premium market
2  China low-end baijiu market has been declining in term of
sales volume  we expect Laojiaos low end baijiu sales would
shrink in volume as well
