3Q19 results beat expectations still less attractive
than its H shares maintain HOLD
 The 3Q19 results were higher than market expectations and we are overall positive
on the Companys fundamentals
 We fine-tuned our forecast numbers We raised our 20192021F net profit forecast by
14%1%07% respectively and keep our Target Price of Rmb200 (13x 2019F PE
also 1sd below the average)
 The current AH spread of 45% is at a historical high (Figure 1) making SPHs A
shares less attractive than its H shares Maintain HOLD
Better-than-expected 3Q recurring bottom line good SGA control
and cash flow management pressure on gross margin
 Reported 9M19 net profit was Rmb3399bn up 08% yoy accounting for
776%79% of our and the Streets 2019F full-year estimates If non-recurring items
are excluded net profit increased by 196% yoy to Rmb307bn On a quarterly
basis 3Q19 net profit (excluding non-recurring items such as fair value changes
and impairments) was Rmb975m up 448% yoy better than expectations
 Overall we note robust revenue growth for each segment while the gross margin
saw some slight pressure Control of SGA expenses was good and finance cost
fell 55% yoy in 9M19 Cash collection was also well managed with operating cash
flow amounting to Rmb293bn up 69% yoy Days receivable remained stable at 90
in 9M19 (vs 896 in 9M18)
Manufacturing segment continued to show solid growth
The manufacturing segment delivered 2405% yoy revenue growth in 9M19 to
Rmb177bn the gross margin was 5754% down 01ppt from 9M18 Strong revenue
growth came from the fast ramp-up of 60 key products whose sales came in at
Rmb1015bn up 312% yoy We believe the Companys more stringent cost
management of raw material procurement and manufacturing centralization largely
mitigated gross margin pressure from drug price cuts Going forward we expect the
manufacturing gross margin to gradually decline by 02 ppt each year (previously we
projected a flat gross margin)
Distribution gross margin pressure can be largely mitigated in the
The distribution segment delivered sales of Rmb1222bn up 186% yoy and the gross
margin was 64% down 027 ppt from 9M18 The 3Q19 topline growth rate was 141%
yoy which was lower than 1H19s 21% because of the consolidation of Cardinal China
and Liaoning Pharmaceutical Foreign Trade in 1H18 We think the distribution segments
organic revenue growth which came from the industrys organic growth (high single
digits) and SPHs MA (ie market consolidation driven by the two-invoice system)
remained solid Looking ahead despite foreseeable margin pressure from the 1) more
stringent industry-wide medical reimbursement standards and more stringent prescription
requirements for physicians and 2) the Group Purchase Organization (GPO) we think
gross margin pressure can be mitigated by 1) better-than-expected Cardinal China
synergy 2) continuing industry consolidation under the two-invoice system and 3)
increased direct sales percentage and product mix changes
