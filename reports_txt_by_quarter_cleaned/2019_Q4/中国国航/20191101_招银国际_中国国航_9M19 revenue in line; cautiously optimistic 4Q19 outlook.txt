China and US are marching towards a phase one deal we reiterate our view that
we expect domestic demand to release However in the context of China-US trade
frictions and unrests in Hong Kong higher proportion of international and regional
routes is a double-edged sword For 4Q19 we remain cautiously optimistic We
factor in our house view of 2019E average Brent crude oil and raise TP from RMB
