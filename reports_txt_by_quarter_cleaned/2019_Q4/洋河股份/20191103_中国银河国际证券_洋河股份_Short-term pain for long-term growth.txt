Short-term pain for long-term growth
 Yanghes 3Q19 sales declined 21% yoy to Rmb5bn and its net profit dropped 23%
yoy to Rmb16bn weaker than the market and our expectations
 Yanghes distribution network has faced challenges since 2Q19 but we expect the
 Downgrade to Hold with a DCF-based TP of Rmb108
High channel inventory negatively impacted 3Q19 sales
Yanghe reported lackluster 9M19 sales growth of 06% yoy to Rmb21bn with net profit
up 2% yoy to Rmb7bn below our expectations In 3Q19 sales declined by 21% yoy and
net profit dropped by 23% yoy mainly because Yanghe partially stopped shipments to
distributors to digest high channel inventory in 3Q19 According to Yanghe management
channel inventory gradually fell to about 25 months at the end of 3Q19 from a peak of
four months in 2Q19 Management expects this to revert to the normal level of 15
months by the year end Advance payment from customers decreased 29% yoy to
Rm2bn at the end of 3Q19
Still in recovery mode
Yanghe reduced its sales rebate to distributors earlier this year which made its
distributors profit margins lower than those of its peers such as Kings Luck and
current challenges with its distribution network in 3Q19 It reduced shipments to
distributors to clean up channel inventory and improved its relationship with its
distributors Yanghe also started strengthening management of its sales team of over
7000 In July 2019 Yanghe recruited Mr Liu Hua Xiang to return as Vice President Mr
Liu was in charge of Yanghes sales and marketing department for many years so he
has plenty of experience dealing with distributors In 3Q19 the Companys SD
expenses ratio increased by 51%pts yoy to 176% from 126% We expect Yanghe to
make further efforts to increase the retail price of its core brand Blue Dream and forecast
that the SD expenses ratio will expand by 16%pts yoy to 122% in FY20F from 115%
Share repurchase expected to increase management motivation
Yanghe announced that it would spend Rmb1Rmb15bn on a share buy-back plan
during the next 12 months with a cap repurchase price of Rmb135 per share Based on
this price Yanghe will buy back 07% of the total issued shares in the next 12 months
These shares will be used for a share option program for key employees in the future
The current management teams equity interest was less than 1% of total shares as at
the end of 1H19 We expect share option plan for key employees to benefit Yanghes
long-term development
Downgrade to Hold with a DCF-based TP of Rmb108
We revised down our FY19F21F EPS by 10%6%1% reflecting Yanghes weaker-than-
expected sales performance because if the short-term challenges with its distribution
network In the longer term we think Yanghes diversified premium product portfolio and
market confidence in the brand Downside risks include 1) a longer-than-expected time to
particular in Yanghes home market  Jiangsu province Positive catalysts include 1)
stronger growth in the new markets and 2) a quicker-than-expected solution to
distribution problem
