China Life announced 9M19 set of result on 29 Oct 2019 which is highlighted by
2) satisfactory progress of underwriting business transition and accordingly 3)
outstanding NBV growth We stay bullish on the Companys near-term financial
performance for the whole year and its long-term outlook as well since business
reform initiatives have been reviving the largest lifer in China profoundly
Net profit surged 190% YoY to RMB 577bn (88% of our revised FY19E

gains and fair value gains from equity investment have contributed to the
majority of improvement 2) One-off tax benefit of RMB 52bn deducting
which net profit would increase164% YoY in 9M19
Life transition underwent satisfactory progress 1) Premium structure
continued to optimize with longer payment durations and more protection-
oriented products FYRP with 10y payment duration accounted for 5106%
of FYRP in 9M19 up 157ppt YoY The share of designated protection-
oriented products increased 879ppt YoY 2) Agent headcount maintained

productive agents increased 374% YoY
Solid NBV growth New business value achieved 204% YoY growth in
9M19 outperforming major peers  The figure was largely in line with our
annual NBV growth estimate at 164% (1Q1H NBV growth was
283%262% respectively) Our growth forecast is slightly lower than 9M19
number due to a higher base in 2H18
Risks 1) Capital market volatilities in 4Q 2) Challenges with respect to
agent team management and quality improvement
