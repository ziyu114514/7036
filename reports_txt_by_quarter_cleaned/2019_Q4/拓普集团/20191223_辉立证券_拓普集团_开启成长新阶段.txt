23 December 2019
拓普集團前三季度實現營收3766 億元人民幣，同比下降1550%。其中，Q3 營收
1328 億元，同比下降390%，環比增長1130%，相比第二季度的下滑25%，降幅明顯
歸屬母公司淨利潤方面，前三季度爲34 億，同比下滑45%。其中第三季度13 億，同
比下滑30%，環比增長30%。同比去年同期，毛利率和淨利潤率分別同比下降155 和
35 個百分點，行業景氣度下行、折舊增加是主要原因。
第三季度業績好轉的主要原因在于下游客戶需求好轉。公司主要客戶吉利汽車上汽通
用第三季度産量環比增加93%38%，上汽自主和長安福特産量也環比改善，帶動公司
産能利用率回升，毛利率環比第二季度提高06 個百分點至264%，淨利潤率也環比提
高14 個百分點至955%。我們預計，隨著四季度主要客戶銷量進一步改善，公司盈利
能力將繼續回升，淨利潤增速有望轉正。
公司在逆境繼續降本增效，第三季度銷售管理研發費用合計占收入比重爲1476%，
環比第二季度减少092 個百分點。公司現金流良好，經營活動淨流入226 億。存貨同
比下降129%至114 億元。
特斯拉的上海工廠投建進度快于預期，10 月開始試生産，年底前將完成接近2 萬輛的
産量。隨著産能逐漸爬坡，2020 年産量將達到15 萬輛，2021 年有望超過25 萬輛。拓
普爲特斯拉供貨的單車配套金額超過5000 元，預估未來兩年Model3 車型將分別爲公
司帶來9300，18 億元的淨利增量，約占公司2018 年淨利的12%和24%。在汽車電子
EVP 和IBS 領域，公司的前瞻布局令其在國內廠商中處于領先地位，未來有望突破國外
巨頭的技術壟斷，實現國産替代。
公司的輕量化底盤和汽車電子業務符合行業升級趨勢，將爲公司新一輪發展注入動
我們預計公司 201920202021 年淨利潤爲 513714969 億元，對應EPS 爲
049068092 元，雖然2019 年業績受壓，但特斯拉國産化加速下公司業績將迎來拐
點，幷且我們看好公司輕量化業務和汽車電子的發展前景，上調公司目標價至19 元，
對應2019 20202021 年392821 倍PE 估值，維持 增持評級。(現價截至12 月
