Henglis net profit in 3Q19 dropped 4% YoY to RMB246mn dragged by a
decline in the sales volume of hydraulic cylinders which also resulted in a lower
gross margin While the result is slightly below expectations we believe the
weakness was temporary as the capacity utilization rate recovered to 100% in
Oct based on our understanding We believe any share price weakness today
offers entry opportunity We continue to like Hengli for its import substitution
growth story on hydraulic cylinder pump and valve which we believe is structural
in nature Stock is trading at 28x 2019E PE
 Key highlights on 3Q19 results Revenue slightly grew 45% YoY to
RMB104bn in 3Q19 which was due to a 30% YoY sales volume decline of
hydraulic cylinder for medium-size excavators This also led to a contraction
of 33ppt YoY on blended gross margin to 353% Besides RD expense
increased 36% YoY to RMB608mn That said the RD spending growth is
understandable as several tranches of new products are under development
All these resulted in a 38% YoY decline in net profit to RMB246mnn
 9M19 net profit accounted for 75% of consensus earnings Revenue and
net profit grew 21% YoY and 27% YoY respectively to RMB38bn and
RMB917mn  driven by (1) 15% YoY revenue growth of hydraulic cylinder for
excavator (2) 8% YoY increase in non-standardized hydraulic cylinder for
heavy equipment (3) 86% YoY increase in hydraulic pump and valve
Operating cash flow surged 216% YoY to RMB117bn higher than the net
profit Based on our check the Company is running at full utilization rate with
two shifts per day in Oct due to order recovery We expect earnings growth
to resume in 4Q19E
