SF delivered solid 3Q19 results backed by improved OPM while adj net profit
parcels will continue to boost volume growth but the accelerated ASP downward
trend make us prudent about revenue outlook in FY1920E That said we expect
rigorous cost control to secure margins amid the heightened price war Maintain
BUY We lifted FY1920E adj EPS by 9%2% respectively and raised TP to
RMB4752 based on 36x33x FY1920E PE
 Strong beat in 3Q19 due to Opex improvement Adj net profit grew 62%
YoY 55% higher than our forecast backed by tight cost control while
revenue increased 26% YoY 11% below our forecast mainly due to larger-
than-expected ASP plump in Sep (ie -14% YoY) As SF will maintain
war we are cautious about ASP trend but expect continued rigorous cost
control will significantly benefit EPS growth despite GPM pressure Hence
we lifted FY1920E EPS by 9%3%
lackluster business parcels and start-up new business we believe share
in near term We expect robust volume growth to continue in FY1920E but
are concerned about ASP accelerated downward trend as ASP was down
by 3%7%11% YoY in JulAugSep respectively Considering heated price
ASP in 4Q19E and thus lower FY1920E revenue estimates by 2%5%
 Tight cost control to secure margins In 3Q19 the Companys Opex
margin ratcheted up by 1ppt QoQYoY thanks to strict cost management
Mgmt guided that SF would carry out RMB3bn cost saving plan in 2H19E
and we believe the continued cost cut will secure margins given foreseeable
 Maintain BUY with TP RMB4752 In view of 1) strong volume growth 2)
ASP downward trend and 3) improved operating leverage we revised up
our FY19-21E adj EPS by 2-9% Therefore we maintained BUY rating and
raised TP to RMB4752 based on same 33x FY20E PE Key risks include
greater-than expected ASP decline and large restricted share circulation
