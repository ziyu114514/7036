母淨利潤4927 億元，同比减少2258%。如剔除去年同期收購小糸車燈帶來的一次性

第三季度營業收入爲35033 億，同比下降575%，歸母淨利潤1563 億元，基本持
平，同比小幅减少17%，對應每股收益04956 元。第三季度的營收和淨利的下降幅度
結構優化，毛利率逆勢保持穩定
公司第一大客戶上汽集團前三季産量下滑160%，但受益于客戶結構調整（上汽大衆
占比提高）和海外業務（延峰內飾海外）拉動，華域汽車收入下降情况好于主要客
戶，基本與行業持平。第三季業務構成來看，內外飾件功能件金屬成型與模具電子
電器件的收入分別錄得2537127106 億元（-31%-62%-88%2%），淨利潤分別
貢獻78510907 億元（54%-215%-182%-22%）。另外，主要原材料價格有所
回落，前三季度毛利率爲145%，同比增加07 個百分點。第三季度毛利率爲142%，
環比下降08 個百分點，主要因國慶放假、生産綫維修及部分客戶國六産品切換等因
費用管控加强，加大研發投入提升競爭力
前三季度銷售、管理和研發費用率分別爲137%56%363%，同比分別-007-00610
個點。管理和銷售費用率的下降反映公司繼續降本控費。研發費用率提升體現公司在
行業下行階段依然不斷加强研發力度，以保障長期競爭力。
經營現金流大幅改善，經營效率提升
受益于車市降幅收窄、整車廠回款較好與公司控制支出，前三季度公司現金流顯著好
轉，淨流入109 億。經營活動現金流淨額爲6625 億元，同比增長499%。存貨從期
初的1141 億元下降到954 億元，經營效率提升。
把握升級趨勢，推進新興業務發展

顯，在汽車行業電動化、網聯化、智能化、共享化的發展賽道上開始取得成績。
