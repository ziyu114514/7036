SANY Heavy announced yesterday that it plans to acquire 9143% interest in
Heavy) for cash consideration of RMB398bn The implied valuation of 244x
2018 PE and 15x PB (equity as at Oct 2019) does not look attractive in our
view Besides an additional liability of RMB68bn will be consolidated in SANY
said we believe the overall impact on SANY Heavy is limited given that the deal
size is not substantial We estimate the earnings accretive will be 1% We have
left our forecast unchanged as the deal is subject to shareholders approval
 Details of the acquisition SANY Capital is one of the 25 auto financing
currently owns 9143% stake in SANY Capital while SANY Heavy owns 3%
interest After the acquisition SANY Heavy will control 9443% stake in SANY
Capital Approval from regulators and shareholders of SANY Heavy is
required before the transaction
 Reasons for the acquisition The acquisition can reduce the connected
transaction Besides SANY Heavy believes that SANY Capital can help
support the Companys overseas expansion and better control risk
 Financial performance of SANY Capital SANY Capital generated interest
as at end-Oct 2019 was RMB29bn while total liabilities reached RMB68bn
implying gearing ratio of 235% Based on our calculation the rate of interest
and 10M19 (figure 1)
 Not attractive due to high valuation and increased liabilities We calculate
that the implied PE (based on earnings in 2018) reached 244x Besides the
acquisition cost of RMB398bn plus the increased attributable liabilities of
RMB64bn (RMB68bn x 9443%) from SANY Capital will result in a reduction
of attributable net cash by RMB10bn though we think is still manageable
due to the Companys strong free cash flow
 Key risks (1) Cyclical nature (2) Risk of overseas business (3) Increase in
raw material cost (4) Risk of expanding to financing business
