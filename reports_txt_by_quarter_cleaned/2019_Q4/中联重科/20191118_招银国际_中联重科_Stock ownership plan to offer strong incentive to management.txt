Whats new We believe the stock ownership plan that announced last Friday
will offer strong motivation to the management and key employees to deliver
sustainable earnings growth over the next three years which should more than
offset the share incentive expense arising from this We maintain our TP of
RMB728 (based on 14x 2019E PB on the back of 12%-13% ROE in 2019E-
21E) Reiterate BUY
 Details of the stock ownership plan The participants include the core
management and key employees in the Company with a maximum of 1200
employees The purchase price is set at RMB275 per share The lock-up
period is divided into three stages with 40% 30% and 30% of the shares to
be unlocked in 2020E 2021E and 2022E respectively subject to Zoomlions
net profit targets during the period Either of the following two criteria has to
be satisfied for each of the year (1) In 2020 21 22 the net profit growth to
 average net profit in 2017-19) (2) the total net profit in 2020-21 to grow 170%
from the Benchmark and the total net profit in 2020-22 to grow 270% from the
Benchmark (Figure 1) The stock ownership plan is subject to the approval by
shareholders in EGM
 Higher expense but higher employee incentive Given that the underlying
shares of the stock ownership plan are the 390mn A shares (496% of total
os shares) the Company repurchased in 2Q19 (average price RMB549) we
calculate that the total share incentive expense to Zoomlion to be RMB1bn in
2020E-22E Thats said we believe the discount on purchase price (RMB275)
is attractive to the participants offering strong incentive
 Investment in agricultural machinery segment Zoomlion plans to invest
RMB205bn in 2020-25 (annual capex RMB342mn) in the intelligent
agriculture machinery business in Wuhu While the industry has been on a
downcycle Zoomlion expects the favourable government policy to support the
upgrade of agriculture machinery will offer new opportunities In 20181H19
revenue from agricultural machinery accounted for only 5%4% of the total
revenue Zoomlion targets to achieve breakeven this year versus a loss in
2018 We fine-tuned our 2020E-21E earnings forecast by -05%-05% after
incorporating the capex but have not modelled growth in this segment Any
improvement will offer upside to our existing forecast

Key catalysts Rising infrastructure spending resilient growth of property area under
construction replacement of national emission standard (NES) III trucks and market share
gain on tower crane and concrete machinery will all serve as share price catalysts
Risk factors (1) Unexpected weakness on property construction activities (2) Slow
recovery of infrastructure spending (3) High earnings volatility
