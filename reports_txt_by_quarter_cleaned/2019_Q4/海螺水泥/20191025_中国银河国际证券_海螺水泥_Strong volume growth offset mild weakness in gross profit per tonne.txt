Strong volume growth offset mild weakness in gross
 3Q2019 recurring net profit grew 8% yoy slightly better than expectations
 Sales volume (ex-trading) rose about 10% yoy in 3Q offsetting a moderate yoy
decline in gross profit per tonne
 We raise our FY19F20F EPS by 3%4% to reflect the stronger volume growth
 We maintain our ADD rating and target price of Rmb4540 (176x 2019F PBv)
 A cement price hike during the peak season in 4Q should be a major catalyst in the
near term
3Q2019 results slightly exceeded market expectations
3Q2019 recurring net profit was Rmb8349m up 8% yoy Reported net profit for 9M2019
was Rmb238bn (up 15% yoy) equivalent to 76% of the full-year market consensus
forecast As 4Q is usually the peak season of the year the Street may revise up its
projections moderately after the results announcement
Overall performance remained solid
Revenue grew 223% yoy in 3Q2019 to Rmb388bn while gross profit rose 61% yoy to
Rmb123bn Revenue growth was much faster than gross profit growth because of the
rapid growth in the trading business which had an insignificant profit contribution Gross
profit per tonne for cement and clinker was about Rmb148 in 3Q2019 down Rmb7 yoy
The mild weakness was largely offset by sales volume growth of about 10% yoy for
cement and clinker This suggests the Company gained market share as growth in the
whole country was in the mid to high single digits
Cement price hike in 4Q expected to support share price
Figures 2 and 3 show that cement prices in east China and south central China have
picked up recently thanks to more construction activity during the peak season in 4Q We
are likely to see another round of price hikes in the next few weeks The low cement
inventory level (Figure 4 and 5)  should also offer support to cement prices in east China
and south central China
We lift our FY19F20F EPS by 3%4% after making a minor upward adjustment in our
sales volume projection and a slight increase in the gross profit per tonne forecast
(Figure 8) We maintain our ADD rating and our target price is unchanged at Rmb4540
(176x 2019F PBv) We set the target price based on a 6% discount to our H-share
target price (the average discount in the past few years)
