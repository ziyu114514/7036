Better margin expansion in 3Q19
 Yili reported net profit growth of 155% in 3Q19 and 116% yoy in 9M19 slightly better
than we expected mainly because of stronger margin expansion
 We expect Yili to continue to upgrade its product mix to drive up its margins in 4Q19F
and FY20F
 Management expects the raw milk price to increase 56% yoy in FY20F which should
lead to a reduction in promotion levels
 Maintain Add with new DCF-based TP of Rmb345
Stronger-than-expected 3Q19 results
Yilis revenue grew 108% and 126% yoy in 3Q19 and 9M19 We estimate that sales
volume grew 67% yoy in 9M19 and a mix upgrade drove up the ASP by 4% Yili also
reduced its pricing promotion in 9M19 which led to ASP improvement of c2% Its gross
margin expanded 03ppt yoy to 355% in 3Q19 since the mix upgrade and promotion
reduction fully offset the raw milk price increase Yili said the raw milk price was up 85%
yoy in 3Q19 and 7% yoy in 9M19 due to strong downstream dairy demand Yili
continued to gain market share in 9M19 gaining a 2ppt yoy market share for liquid milk to
388% by end-3Q19 According to ACNielsen data the industry volume growth of liquid
milk was 2% in 9M19 with normal temperature milk up 3% and low temperature products
down 25% We now expect Yilis revenue to grow 128%114% yoy in FY19FFY20F
Mix upgrade to continue
Yili continued product premiumization in 3Q19 and sales of high-end products continued
to grow faster Sales of its high-end UHT milk Santine and room temperature yoghurt
Ambrosial grew 17% and 178% yoy in 9M19 (3Q19 high-teens and 15% yoy growth)
Sales of high-end infant milk powder increased 286% yoy in 8M19 Yili launched dream
cover organic Santine milk with protein content of 38g in Sep and will launch fat free
dream cover soon It will also launch new low-temperature products in 4Q19F We expect
low temperature sales growth to return to positive yoy in FY20F from -1% yoy in 9M19
and Yili to continue to upgrade its product mix to drive up margins in 4Q19F and FY20F
Exploring new business opportunities
Yili set up healthy drinks and cheese business units in 2H18 and launched a soy milk
drink last year Management expects soy milk sales to grow in the mid-teens yoy in
FY19F to Rmb500m600m Childrens cheese launched early this year received positive
market feedback This month Yili launched mineral water products and will expand its
water capacity in FY2021F Currently Yili has c2000 distributors for its healthy drinks
half of them existing dairy distributors and the remaining half new
Promotion levels to fall gradually
Because of a reduction in promotion and good operating leverage its distribution
in the GA expenses ratio of 13%pts leading to OPM improvement of 08%ppt yoy to
96% in 3Q19 Management expects the raw milk price to increase 56% yoy in FY20F
which should lead to a reduction in promotion levels We expect Yili to maintain stable
OPM yoy in FY20F
Maintain Add with new DCF-based TP of Rmb345
We fine tuned our FY1921F earnings forecasts by 15%09%-27% to reflect better
margin assumptions and expenses related to Yilis restricted share plan We maintain our
Add rating since we like Yilis product premiumization and lower promotion level A
positive catalyst is stronger margin expansion owing to better control of expenses And
the main risk is higher-than-expected raw milk prices
