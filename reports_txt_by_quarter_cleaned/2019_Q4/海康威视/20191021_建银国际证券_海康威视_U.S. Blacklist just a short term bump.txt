US Blacklist just a short term bump
 On the US Blacklist now but markets were warned of this a
 Company has actively prepared for this in order to lower the
damage to its supply chain
 Short term bump will not deter the rise of the worlds No1 player
in this field maintain Outperform
On the US Blacklist now but markets were warned of this a year ago On
Monday this week Hikvision together with Dahua and six other Chinese
customers as since the very beginning of the US-China trade dispute
over a year ago various political voices from the US had already said
to its supply chain Hikvision has halted trading in the last two days and
FPGA and storage memory they have tried their best to shift to non-US
diversifying its client base into developing markets like India Vietnam
and the Philippines and has lowered US client contribution to Hikvisions
overall revenue to a very low percentage (1-2% YTD)
No damage to its global No1 position maintain Outperform As the
worlds No1 player in the video surveillance camera field with a market
share of c30% in 2018 we believe Hikvision has the experience and
ability to continue serving their clients and will thus continue to enjoy
steady growth The restriction from the US side will not knock Hikvision out
of the field and we believe it will instead motivate it to enhance RD
development and sharpen its technology as well as enhance efforts to
fundamentals remain intact and maintain our forecast for a revenuenet
profit CAGR of 17%12% for 2018-2021F We maintain our Outperform
rating and target price of RMB3600 still based on 25x 2020 PE in-line
with its five-year average We see any large share price correction
following this incident to be a good entry point
