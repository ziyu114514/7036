 Results positives 1) CITICBs loan growth remained healthy at 31%
QoQ faster than system loan growth of 26% QoQ and total asset growth of
10% QoQ We believe it was primarily driven by retail loans as the Bank

134% and NPL ratio stayed flat at 172% Provision coverage climbed

better mix of interest-earning assets and strict control in funding cost 4) Net

 Results negatives 1) Deposit growth slowed to 04% QoQ pushing up
LDR by 26ppts to 977% This was likely due to less deposit absorption
effort under CBIRCs clampdown on irregular structured deposits 2) 3Q19
opex went up 149% YoY possibly on rising expenses in technology
