Tsingtao Brewery-A
Successful mix upgrade
 Tsingtao reported net profit growth of 198% yoy in 3Q19 in line with our expectation
 We expect Tsingtao to continue its mix upgrade in FY20F to drive up its ASP and
 Falling barley and paper prices will also support Tsingtaos GPM in FY20F
 We initiate coverage on Tsingtao-A with an ADD rating with a DCF-based TP of
Tsingtao-H
Strong 3Q19 earnings growth
Tsingtaos 9M19 sales grew 53% yoy to Rmb249bn (87% of our full-year FY19F sales
forecast) and net profit was up by 23% yoy to Rmb26bn in line with our expectations In
3Q19 total sales slightly declined by 17% yoy The 59% volume decrease was partially
offset by a 45% ASP increase The volume of its core brand Tsingtao fell by 24% yoy
in 3Q19 and the volume of its sub-brands declined by 89% yoy We believe the volume
decline in 3Q19 was mainly due to 1) clearing the channel inventory that had
accumulated by the end of June 2) weak sales in nightlife channels and 3) relatively
cooler weather the past summer which reduced beer consumption We expect
Tsingtaos channel inventory to return to the normal level in 4Q19F and forecast sales
growth of 62% in FY20F
Successful mix upgrade expected to drive up margins
Tsingtaos overall ASP in 9M19 was up by 52% with flattish volume growth of 07%
which was in line with Chinas 9M19 beer industry output volume growth Tsingtao
continued its premiumization and the volume contribution of Tsingtao its core brand
was up by 15%pts to 491% in 9M19 In 3Q19 Tsingtaos gross margin improved by
18%pts yoy to 322% mainly due to a product mix upgrade and a VAT cut The SD
expenses ratio was 161% in 3Q19 up by 08%pts but partially offset by better control of
GA expenses Its OPM improved by 21%pts to 141% in 3Q19
Lower raw material prices to support margins in FY20F
The international barley price has been falling since Aug dropping by 26% yoy in Aug
Oct which should benefit Tsingtaos gross margin for 4Q19F and FY20F The paper
price also fell by 16% yoy in 9M19 which should reduce Tsingtaos packaging material
costs We now expect Tsingtaos gross margin to expand by 08%ppt and 11%pts yoy to
297% and 308% in FY19F and FY20F respectively because of a mix upgrade and
lower raw material prices
Continuing to shut down underperforming plants
Last year Tsingtao closed two plants the Yangpu plant in Shanghai and the Wuhu plant
in Anhui province We expect Tsingtao to continue to close 12 plants in 4Q19F In FY18
Tsingtao incurred one-off plant closure expenses of Rmb195m and we expect similar
plant closure expenses for FY19F We believe the shut-down of underperforming plants
will improve Tsingtaos utilization rate and margins in the medium to long term
Initiate with Add with DCF-based TP of Rmb54
We initiate coverage on Tsingtao-A with an Add rating and a DCF-based TP of Rmb54
Our TP is derived by applying a 5% premium (historical average A-share premium) on
our TP for Tsingtao-H We like Tsingtao because of its successful product mix upgrade
and falling raw material costs Positive catalysts include 1) stronger volume growth in
4Q19F and 2) better margin expansion The risks include 1) weaker-than-expected beer
