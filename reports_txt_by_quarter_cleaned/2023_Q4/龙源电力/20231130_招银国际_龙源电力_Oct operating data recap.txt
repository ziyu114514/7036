CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
China Longyuan (001289 CH)
Oct operating data recap
China Longyuan (CLY)s operating data in Oct 2023 was lower than our
expectation with a YoY decline of 1099% in total power generation due to
lower wind power generation However thermal power and other renewable
power showed solid growth CLY has implemented share repurchases to
demonstrate confidence in its operations Additionally as a pioneer of
renewable power operator in China CLY is expected to benefit from the
collaborative efforts of China and the US to triple global renewable energy
installed capacity by 2030 Consequently we adjust our TP to RMB2398
and maintain BUY
 Oct operating data slightly missed our estimates In Jan-Oct 2023 CLY
recorded accumulated power generation of 60953811 MWh up by 587%
YoY In particular wind power generation rose by 331% YoY while its
thermal power generation dropped by 307% YoY During the same period
other solar and renewable power maintained rapid growth of 13905% YoY
In Oct 2023 CLYs power generation declined by 1099% YoY to
5449262MWh dragged by lower wind power generation which declined by
1959% YoY However thermal power and other renewable power remained
solid growth up by 1557%YoY and 16292% YoY
 CLY previously approved and implemented a resolution to repurchase
H shares  The share repurchase will be carried out in multiple stages with
shares in five trading days prior to the repurchase The repurchase quantity
will not exceed 10% of the total H shares issued In Nov 2023 CLY
repurchased 358mn H shares (accounted for 00427% of existed issued
shares) at a price range of HK 607-643share totalling HK 225mn CLY
plans to continue the share buyback to demonstrate confidence in its
operations and regard the current share price as attractive
 CLY as the pioneer of renewable power operator in China will benefit
from China-US collaboration in tripling renewable energy capacity by
2030 under the Sunnylands Statement China and the US worked jointly
in The Sunnylands Statement to address the climatic crisis and strive to triple
global renewable energy capacity by 2030 CLY is the pioneer of renewable
power operators in China its new energy installation process and
development will be further speed up For 2023E we believe CLY may
achieve its previous newly-added installed capacity target of 5500MW
 TP was adjusted to RMB2398 maintain BUY Thanks to the strong
operating data of Jan-Oct 2023 we lowered our estimated wind power
utilization hour and solar power utilization hours and updated our predicted
23E24E25E Therefore we slightly adjusted our TP to RMB2398 for CLY-
A based on 22x FY24E PE and FY24E rolling EPS of RMB109 Maintain
