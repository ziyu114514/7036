 Analysis of key performance metrics in CLYs wind power operations
1) On-grid tariff showed a trend of decline while green electricity and green
certificate trading increased
CLYs average on-grid electricity price for wind power remained steady at RMB0482kWh
in 2019 and increased slightly to RMB0487RMB0489kWh in 20202021 However by
2022 it decreased to RMB0481kWh due to a raised proportion of electricity transactions
In 1H23 CLYs average on-grid electricity price was RMB0457kWh with on-grid tariff of
wind power at RMB0469kWh (a 35%YoY decrease) that of solar power at
RMB0313kWh (a 337% YoY decrease) and that of thermal power at RMB415MWh (a
39% YoY drop) The decline in average on-grid tariff was attributed to the growth in the
proportion of electricity transactions
For 1Q-3Q23 the average on-grid electricity price for wind power was RMB0474kWh
while for thermal power it was RMB0421kWh Both wind and thermal power tariff
a rise reaching RMB400mn in 1Q-3Q23 with a total of 1bn kWh traded We believe that
as green electricity and green certificate trading mature it will bring significant revenue
growth for CLY in the future

capacity of solar power in 2023 will be 95GW and the optimistic prediction will be 120 GW
Meanwhile according to data from the NEA the newly-added installed capacity of solar
power in 1Q23 was 3366 GW up by 15481% YoY As of Apr 2023 domestic PV
In the first eight months of this year China added 11316 GW of solar power installed
capacityrepresenting YoY growth of 15446% This is in line with our optimistic
expectations so we maintain our previous forecast and we are positive that the newly-
added installed capacity of solar power in 2023 may reach 120 GW with cumulative
installed capacity of 513 GW for the year
Additionally solar power will continue to maintain high growth in 2024 and 2025 and we
estimate cumulative solar power installed capacity will reach 652 GW and 811 GW

Technological innovation in the wind power industry will further reduce the cost
of wind power operation
Chinas wind power industry is undergoing technological innovation during these years
and new technologies will further reduce the cost of wind power Currently technological
innovation in the wind power industry is mainly focused on three areas 1) advances in wind
turbine technology including large-scale high-efficiency intelligent and modular turbines
2) improvements in wind farm operation and maintenance management technology
including digitization intelligence autonomy and integration and 3) optimization of wind
farm layout and design including site selection wind farm layout wind farm integration
Policy support for the solar power industry and energy storage
The solar power industry has also received policy support and policy dividends will drive
rapid development of the solar market in our view In recent years the NEA  has issued a
notice on solar power generation development proposing a series of policy measures
including increasing support for developing PV power for poverty alleviation promoting the
construction of solar power energy storage projects and accelerating the construction
of demonstration PV power stations for poverty alleviation providing strong policy
guarantees for the development of the solar power industry

In the future wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation will continue to be
the main forms of new energy power generation in our view At the same time to better
promote the development of new energy power generation we believe it is also necessary
to strengthen grid construction and research on energy storage technologies and improve
the consumption capacity and stability of new energy power generation
Abundant project reserves to support continued growth in
electricity generation

Lower upstream costs lead to higher IRR of wind farm and
solar power projects lifting CLYs investment willingness
The wind power industry in China has entered the Grid Parity Era since 2021 leading to a
reduction in upstream costs and a decline in wind turbine prices According to Wind Power
Headlines the highest price for onshore wind turbines reached RMB4200kW in mid-2020
and fell to the lowest at RMB1150kW (ex-tower tube) in Feb 2023 dropping by 73%
Therefore lower upstream costs have resulted in an increase in the IRR of wind power
projects making more projects suitable for investment by CLYAs a result we expect CLY
to show a higher willingness to invest in wind power installation in 2023
In the past three months turbine prices have experienced a rebound From May to July
the price of onshore turbines (excluding the tower) increased to RMB1652kW returning
to early 2023 levels However in recent tenders and purchases prices have been lowered
again In the latest few weeks the average winning bid price for a 350 MW onshore wind
power project (ex- the tower) was RMB1601kW The lowest winning bid price (ex-the
tower) was RMB1420kW while the highest winning bid price was RMB1788kW The
winning bid price including the tower was RMB2100kW

The optimization of the industrial chain in the wind power sector reduces cost and increases
efficiency which drives the long-term growth in IRR of the onshore wind power projects
For example if the average tariff (incl tax) for the project is RMB045kWh and the
construction cost of a 100MW onshore wind power project falls from RMB4500kW to
RMB4000kW the IRR of the project would increase from 11% to 143% Additionally if
the construction cost decreases further to RMB3800kWh the IRR would increase to
155% Despiterecent wind turbine prices have experienced a slight rebound the lowest
bidding prices in the market remain around RMB1400 We believe that a reasonable price
level would be around RMB1600 Despite this we believe the overall profitability outlook
remains optimistic indicating a positive IRR

Figure 19 Sensitivity analysis of IRR (onshore wind power project)
Source CMBIGM estimates
Assuming utilization hours of 2000
As the IRR for wind farm projects increases thanks to lower upstream costs more projects
will meet CLYs investment IRR criteria Therefore a higher IRR of wind power projects is
likely to boost CLYs investment willingness in newly-added wind power installations
For solar farms given the upstream costs continue to drop we believe the IRR of wind
farm projects will further rise Recently the lowest reported price for solar module
price of RMB0993W was observed breaking the barrier of RMB1W according to the
latest group procurement In light of CLYsfocus on increasing photovoltaic installed
newly-added installed capacity targets for 2023 As a result CLYs new project IRR is
expected to further increase and the process of solar power capacity installation is
expected to accelerate
Figure 20 Sensitivity analysis of IRR (solar power project)
Source Company data CMBIGM estimates
Lower upstream costs in the short to medium term are expected to benefit the IRR of CLYs
new energy projects while continuous technological progress may also create
opportunities for IRR improvement Otherwise changes in the non-technical costs related
IRR as well
Additionally CLYs accelerated deployment of wind and solar power installed capacity as
well as active deployment of energy storage should support the stability of its wind and
photovoltaic power generation However developing energy storage capacity may increase
construction costs and put some pressure on the projects IRR Therefore overall changes
The improvement of power generation and average utilization hours
Due to the rapid increase in wind power and solar power installed capacity Chinas wind
power and solar power generation have grown significantly The average utilization hours
of grid-connected wind and solar power equipment have shown an overall upward trend
mainly due to the significant improvement in the wind and solar power curtailment rate

We assign a target price of RMB2328 for CLY-A shares based on FY23E PE ratio of 240x
(close to 1SD of 3-year avg PE) Currently CLY-A trades at 218x FY23E PE We believe
the valuation is not demanding but still has upside potential Given the rapid growth of the
condition and substitution of large for small will unlock growth potential we have a BUY
rating for CLY-A
