Upgrade to BUY Although BYD-As share price has been between -15% and
13% of our previous target price of RMB 270 our major concerns with a prior
HOLD rating were more about model cycle and margin dent from a potential
overcapacity It turned out that BYDs sales volume growth has lasted longer than
expected and its earnings have been more solid than our prior forecasts We now
think that such trends could continue in the next few quarters aided by premium
models exports and greater economies of scale Unlike some investors we think
BYDs catch up in intelligent connectivity may be faster than expected
 3Q23 earnings beat BYDs 3Q23 net profit of RMB 104bn was in the middle
of its preliminary earnings range thanks to its strong GPM and SGA cost
control Its 3Q23 GPM of 217% was about 15 ppts higher than our prior
forecast GPM excluding BYDE (285 HK BUY) reached 257% SGA ratio
also narrowed by 08 ppts QoQ RD expenses exceeded RMB 11bn in 3Q23
or 68% of revenue Net profit per vehicle (excluding BYDE) reached RMB
11400 the highest in history
 Solid earnings outlook ahead We expect BYDs sales volume to rise 23%
YoY to 37mn units in FY24E in line with our projected growth of NEV
wholesale volume for China We revise up our FY24E net profit forecast by
29% to RMB 394bn (net profit of RMB 9700 per vehicle excluding BYDE)
assuming that GPM in FY24E is to narrow slightly YoY to account for rising
should its more premium new models and exports offset dent from price war
Its new-generation DM technology could also help cut costs
 Catch-up in autonomous driving and smart cockpit could be faster than
expected BYDs RD expenses in FY23E could be 30% higher than Li Auto
We believe such RD investments along with its partnership with Momenta
(which also works with SAIC (600104 CH NR)) could help BYD catch up
 EarningsValuation We upgrade our rating of BYD-A from Hold to BUY and
raise target price from RMB 270 to RMB 300 based on 22x our revised FY24E
PE which reflects 10% AH premium on our BYD-H TP We are of the view
that such valuation is justified given Teslas (TSLA US NR) current 40x
FY24E PE and Li Autos 20x FY24E PE Key risks to our rating and target
price include lower NEV sales volume and margins as well as sector de-rating
