Innolight (300308 CH)
Strong 3Q results on accelerating AI revenue
BUY (Maintain)
Innolight has released its 3Q23 results with resilient growth in both revenueNP at
149%895% YoY and 397%884% QoQ respectively The strong revenue growth
was driven by substantial global demand for 400G and 800G optical transceivers
Notably the Companys gross margin showed consistent improvement across the first
three quarters of 2023 climbing from 295%311% in 1Q2Q to 335% in 3Q The
results were in line with our previous expectations (link) that Innolight is one of the true
AI beneficiaries and we expect AI-related revenue to contribute more in Innolights
revenue starting from 3Q We continue to believe Innolights AI revenue growth will
accelerate in the next few quarters Maintain BUY rating with unchanged TP of
 New incentive program showed Companys confidence in 2024-27 top line
and bottom line growth Innolight announced its new incentive plan on 22 Oct
RMB135bnRMB170bnRMB205bnRMB235bn for 2024-27 2) minimum net
profit targets of RMB265bnRMB297bnRMB331bnRMB341bn for 2024-27
The 2024 targets translate into 400% growth in revenue and 1165% growth in net
profit from RMB96bn revenue and RMB12bn net profit in 2022 The 2025-27
targets translate into 259%206%146% YoY growth in revenue and
121%114%3% YoY in net profit growth
 True AI beneficiaries apart from Nvidia start riding the tailwind We have
noticed discrepancies in 3Q performances of several optical transceiver peers
This underscores Innolights position as a market leader and further solidifies its
status as a true beneficiary of the ongoing AI momentum a point we previously
highlighted in our report (link)  We believe these true beneficiaries in AI value
 Maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RMB10930 Looking ahead we expect the
Company to maintain its robust performance driven by the production ramp-up of
800G optical transceivers and better-than-expected demand for 400G products
the overseas hyperscalers are expected to announce earnings results soon
Upside catalysts 1) faster-than-expected ramp-up of 800G and 2) slower-than-
expected decline of non-AI revenue Downside risks 1) continuous rise in interest
rates 2) intensified geopolitical tensions and 3) lower-than-expected production
