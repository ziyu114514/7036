CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Weichai Power (000338 CH)
3Q23 earnings surged 120-200% YoY Strong
gas trucks sales continue to be key driver
Over the weekend Weichai pre-announced that net profit in 3Q23 is expected
to surge 120-200% YoY to RMB203-277bn which is better than our
expectation The impressive 3Q23 earnings boosted the net profit in 9M23 up
by 80-100% YoY We believe the strong growth in 3Q was driven by natural gas
trucks and export We maintain our positive stance on Weichai as the decline in
LNG price will continue to boost sales of LNG trucksengines where Weichai
has strong presence We revise up our 2023E24E25E earnings forecasts by
17%9%8% largely due to higher engines sales volume assumptions We
revise up our SOTP-based TPs for Weichai AH to RMB147HK161 Reiterate
 Weichais engine sales outpaced industry in 8M23 Weichais multi-
cylinder sales (including HDTs and other large-size engines) grew 25% YoY
to 460k units in 8M23 much better than the industry average of 6%
according to CICEIA The market share reached 17% in 8M23 up 26ppt
 HDT industry sales volume 55% YoY in Sep According to the
preliminary data from Cvworld China HDT industry sales volume in Sep
(including export) grew 55% YoY to 80k units driven by strong demand for
natural gas trucks and export In 9M23 China HDT sales volume (including
export) grew 32% YoY to 690k units
 Natural gas HDT accounted for 31% of total HDT sales in Sep The latest
LNG price declined 40% from the peak in late 2022 while the diesel price
dropped 20% during the period Sales of natural gas HDT therefore has
had a strong run since early this year with the percentage of total HDT sales
rising from 7% in Dec 2022 to 31% in Sep 2023 We believe the current
price difference will continue to boost the sales of LNG trucks given the
lower operating cost to truck owners Weichai will continue to be a key
beneficiary as we estimate Weichai has 50% market share in the HDT gas
engine sector
and 3) weaker-than-expected new business growth
