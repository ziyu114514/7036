CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Yonyou (600588 CH)
Inflection point appeared but structural
improvement likely takes time
HOLD (Upgrade)
Yonyou reported (28 Oct) mixed 3Q23 results revenue was RMB23bn (14 %
YoY) in line with Bloomberg consensus estimates and demonstrated an
improvement from -5% YoY decline in 1H23 thanks to the gradual wear off of
reorganizational impact 3Q23 net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was
RMB185mn although it narrowed from that of RMB284mn in 3Q22 it missed
consensus of a loss of RMB138mn which we attribute to the 43ppt miss on
GPM which came in at 509% (3Q22 499%) We upgrade the stock from SELL
to HOLD given likely better outlook on revenue growth and margin improvement
in 4Q23 with the wear off of reorganizational impact but overall macro and
enterprises budget pressure takes time to relieve and we await more concrete
EVSales (was 60x) on 2023E revenue in line with the one-year mean
 Inflection point on cloud revenue growth appearedIn 3Q23 cloud
services revenue was RMB16bn up 28% YoY (1H23 20% YoY) and ERP
revenue fell 10% YoY to RMB713mn Cloud service revenue for large mid-
sized enterprise came in at RMB11bn162mn for 3Q23 with respective
growth of 22%61% YoY improving from -3%25% YoY in 1H23
Management highlighted that new contract value growth was over 20% YoY
each month for four consecutive months since June 2023 vs -6% YoY in
5M23 and cumulative contract value for large enterprises reached
RMB30bn127bn in 9M233Q23 up 1729% YoY which both demonstrated
an improvement in fundamentals in our view
 but concrete margin improvement likely takes time GPM improved
10ppt to 509% in 3Q23 driven by healthy revenue growth but was 43ppts
shy of consensus forecast due to greater-than-expected impact from
organizational change (especially for large enterprise projects) As for
operating expenses SM expenses grew 20% YoY in 9M23 (303% of total
revenue 47ppts YoY) administrative expenses up 1% YoY in 9M23
(140% of revenue -02ppt YoY) and RD expenses grew 1% YoY in 9M23
(262% of total revenue -03ppt YoY) We estimate ARR contribution for
cloud revenue to be stable YoY at around 32% for Yonyou (vs 60% for
Kingdee) in 2023 and we believe an increase in ARR contribution is vital to
drive the unleash of operating leverage over the long term
 Cut target price to RMB1645 but upgrade to HOLD Yonyous share price
has fallen 33% vs -8% for CSI300 YTD and we believe the market has
priced in the impact of the organizational changes With a better revenue
could be limited but recovery on macro and enterprises digitalization budget
likely still takes time to bring concrete improvement on Youyous top-line
