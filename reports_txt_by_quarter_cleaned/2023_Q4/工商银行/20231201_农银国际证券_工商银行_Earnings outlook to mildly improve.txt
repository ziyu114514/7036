Analyst  Johannes Au
Topline growth to gradually recover in FY24E Despite the weak topline momentum in
9M23 our base case suggests ICBCs topline growth to turn positive starting from FY24E
pressure will lessen from FY24E partly also supported by ICBCs solid balance sheet
growth as a result of backing up real economy For FY23E NIM would be down 32bps
YoY but the reduction would be much smaller at 9bps and 7bps YoY for FY24E and
FY25E overall we expect NIM to be 144%-160% over FY23E-25E This would support
FY25E considering the policy stance directing big banks to reduce fee rates as well as
the unfavorable capital market and slow recovery in retail consumptions Overall we
anticipate a topline CAGR of 29% over FY22-25E
Asset quality outlook to stay benign With the rollout of supportive measures for the
real estate sector we expect the banks asset quality outlook to remain benign in
FY23E-25E Its NPL ratio would be in the range of 131%-135% which is lower than the
system average of 161% as of Sep 2023 according to the NAFR The declining NPL ratio
would support risk buffers and our base case estimates ICBCs provisioning ratio and
provision coverage ratio to be in the range of 298%-310% and 22074%-23664% in
FY23E-25E Assuming Chinas macro growth to recover steadily without any new major
risk outbreaks we project provision expenses to expand at 13% CAGR over FY22-25E
