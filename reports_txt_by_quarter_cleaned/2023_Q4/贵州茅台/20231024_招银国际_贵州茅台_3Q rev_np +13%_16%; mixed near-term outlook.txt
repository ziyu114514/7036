CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Kweichou Moutai (600519 CH)
3Q revnp 13%16% mixed near-term outlook
3Q net profit grew 160% YoY to RMB169bn The growth momentum
sequentially decelerated from 208% in 1H as revenue of the quarter slowed in
tandem to 131% from 194% in 1H The 17% 9M revenue growth still largely
tracks to consensus estimates however an unchanged 15% full year revenue
growth guidance could imply 4Q revenue growth to dip further to HSD% the
lowest we note since 3Q20 In fact the trend looks to go hand-in-hand with
distributors reluctance to restock after the Golden Week Holiday when
consumers have been increasingly trading down and when sentiment to
consume has been languishing On the contrary as a positive note price
fluctuations for the flagship Feitian remained in-range and wholesale price (seal
case) settled at around RMB2900 per bottle about RMB100 lower than what
we saw last month These in aggregate put together a relatively mixed near-
term outlook for Moutai in our view That said in the medium term we are still
hopeful of seeing Moutais brand premium product scarcity and efforts in
from exposing to any risk of malignant pricing and irrational destocking
 Sales mix 3Q9M sales revenue recorded RMB335bn1029bn
131%183% YoY Moutai spirit sales in 3Q grew 15% YoY 10% QoQ
to RMB279bn when sales contribution was sequentially flattish at 835%
Direct channel sales of the quarter inflated 35% YoY 9% QoQ to
RMB148bn with iMoutai platform showing major growth at 37%
YoY25 QoQ contributing RMB55bn revenue Meanwhile wholesale
channels revenue was RMB187bn up  2% YoY10% QoQ
 Cashflows OCF of the quarter grew 432% YoY to RMB50bn thanks to a
RMB42bn cash received from sales activity Cash on hand raised to
RMB1593bn with a RMB96bn net increase These were in line with a
higher contract liability which went up by RMB41bn in the quarter to RMB
 Earnings change We moderately trim our 2023-25E revenue and net profit
by-09% to -29% -14% to -35% to reflect the results
 Valuation Our TP is based on an updated 390x (from previously 410x)
end-23E PE which still represents long-term average since 2019 Our
methodology reflects our relative optimism (vis-a-vis other FB diversified
of which target multiples are based on -1sd below long term average) on
Moutai that it could outperform its peers thanks to its brand premium and
product scarcity
