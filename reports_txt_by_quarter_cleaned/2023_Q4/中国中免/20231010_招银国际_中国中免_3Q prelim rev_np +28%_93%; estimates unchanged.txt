CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
CTGDF (601888 CH)
3Q prelim revnp 28%93% estimates unchanged
CTGDF reported preliminary 3Q financial data with revenue increasing by
279% YoY to RMB150bn gross margins expanding to 343% (1Q2Q
288%325%) and net profits growing 931% to RMB13bn The quarters
visitation momentum to Hainan (6M 303% YoY vs 8M 386% YoY) Other than
that a slightly lower pre-tax margin of 108% (2Q 119%) caught our attention
and that was probably owing to higher revenue shares to airports All in all when
consensus expectation is tapering we continue to argue that earnings risk is
incrementally contained and our implied 4Q revenuenet profits of
RMB21bn17bn should look intact on a seasonally stronger festival travelling
and spending
 Major 101 Golden week indicators were a mixed bag A total of 826mn
people travelled domestically between the 8 days of 29 Sep to 6 Oct 104%
of pre-COVID but is below government target of 113% In dollar terms
tourism revenue of RMB753bn stood at 102% of pre-COVID level Each
traveller spent 4% less vs pre-COVID and yet 5% more vs the 51 holiday
this year Our TMT team noted that long-haul travel has increased to 51%
  but those of Hainan looked well-expected A total of 43mn tourists to
the Island during the break 107% of pre-COVID and 133% of the level seen
in the 51 holiday this year The number of DF shoppers per day is 3% less
 Earnings change We largely maintain our forecasts for now and wait for
further details at full results release on 27 Oct  In our model we continue
to assume RMB46bn Hainan DFS revenue (including Haitang Bay)
 Valuation We maintain our average valuation from 2018 inclusive In our
view there is presumably no quick fix to the flattering consumption recovery
and now we project CTGDF to grow at a more normalised cadence over
2024-25E in tandem with the macro economy With no major changes to
our earnings forecasts our revised TP is based on an updated 275x (from
previously 290x) end-24E PE which still benchmarks to -1sd below 5-year
average since 2018
