CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Yili Industrial (600887 CH)
3Q revnp 3%59% cost cut was key to profit growth
Yilis 3Q revenuenet profit stood at RMB31231bn up 27%595% and both
came in in line with our estimates The former was largely driven by a sequential
acceleration in liquid milk sales to 85% YoY (from -26%05% in 1Q2Q) that
offset a rather disappointing momentum in low-tempIMF sales (-357%-39%
GPM along with a notable 16pp decline in opex ratio which we previously
asserted it to be a major earnings growth driver Management has guided down
full-year sales growth target to MSD% (from low-teen) and we believe this
already trimmed down to HSD% since 1H results Separately management also
sounded realistically positive on 4Q and even on 2024E outlook with an
actionable roadmap to gain market share in each segment We remain Buyer of
 Outlook by segment Management expects single-digit growth in liquid-
milk for 2023 considering the timing difference between 2023 and 2024
CNY that impacts the timing of restocking among distributors The premium
Satine brand should keep its double-digit sales growth and further
accelerate in 2024 IMF should deliver QoQ improvement as new products
introduced since August were well-received Considering also the exit of
small players amid industry consolidation October sales have already
returned to positive growth The adult milk formula has fared well Low-
temp business dipped in 3Q due to seasonality and a lower-than-expected
temperature nationwide That said given the segments insignificant
contribution over 2H management still sees double-digit growth potential
for the full year
 Earnings change We slightly trim our 2023E revenue by 29% driven by
a 78% cut in IMF sales followed by a 67%05% cut in low-temp dairy and
liquid milk sales Separately we raise our GPM by 02pp to reflect an easing
input cost pressure and this should partially offset the impact of a slower
top-line growth Our net profit estimate is 15% lower
 Valuation Our revise TP to RMB345 (from previously RMB365) based on
an updated 205x (from previously 210x) roll-forwarded mid-24E PE which
still benchmarks to -1sd below average We value both Mengniu (2319 HK
BUY) Yili (600887 CH BUY) and Feihe (6186 HK HOLD) at -1sd below
average in view of lukewarm dairy demand especially that for IMF amid a
faltering consumption recovery
