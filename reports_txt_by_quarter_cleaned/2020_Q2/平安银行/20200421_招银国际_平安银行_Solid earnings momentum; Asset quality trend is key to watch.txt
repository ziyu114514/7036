PAB reported decent 1Q20 PPoPnet profit growth of 194%148% YoY
Healthy credit expansion stable NPL ratio and better operating efficiency were
key positives 1Q20 NIM narrowed 2bp QoQ but should outperform peers on
resilient loan pricing and higher proportion of market-based funding Down 21%
YTD (vs -116%-59% for A-share banksCSI 300 Index) the Bank appeared to
be over-penalized for above-peers exposure to consumption related loans
Despite temporary fluctuation in retail NPLs PAB is likely among the first to
walk out of this credit down-cycle as we expect corporate loan quality to be well
 Results positives 1) Loan growth was robust at 52% QoQ vs 46% QoQ
for system loans Corporate loan growth accelerated to 114% QoQ on
policy stimulus while retail loans were muted (08% QoQ) on subdued
consumption activities amid COVID-19s outbreak 2) Investment gain
picked up 479% YoY as PAB increased bond portfolio during monetary
better operating efficiency 4) Asset quality continued to improve NPL
ratio was stable at 165% and provision coverage climbed 172ppt QoQ to
2003% Loss recognition was stricter as NPLs covered 1093%1287%
(53ppt69ppt) of 6090day overdue loans 5) Expanding retail client
base with faster growth in HNW No of retail client rose 16% QoQ to
986mn and wealthprivate banking clients saw faster growth of 52%77%
QoQ suggesting improving service capability and stronger customer
stickiness 6) Capital position was strengthened CET1total CAR edged
up 9bp105bp QoQ to 920%1427% as the Bank issued RMB30bn
perpetual bond in Feb
 Results negatives 1) 1Q20 NIM narrowed 2bp QoQ to 260% Asset yield
retreated 3bp QoQ mainly on lower rates of return from debt investments
and interbank assets Liability cost slid 1bp QoQ driven by falling interbank
slowed to 17% YoY likely due to weakening bank card and agency service
fees amid the pandemic 3) Retail NPL ratio surged 33bp QoQ to 152%
with NPL ratio of credit card and auto finance up the most by 66bp and 33bp
QoQ respectively That said corporate NPL ratio fell 48bp QoQ to 181%
 Maintain BUY and RMB1980 TP We keep our FY20-22E earnings
forecasts and TP unchanged and await further details from PABs results
