SAIC Motor announced its FY19 results Revenue achieved RMB8433bn (vs
CMBIS estimate of RMB8863bn consensus estimate of RMB8186bn) a
decrease of 7% YoY NP was RMB256bn (vs CMBIS estimate RMB300bn 
consensus estimate of RMB268bn) a decrease of 29% YoY EPS declined 29%
to RMB219 while DPS was RMB088 in 2019 The divd yield was 46%
The Company sold 624 mn units in 2019 a decline of 115%YoY (SAIC
PV of 07mn-41%YoY SAIC Volkswagen of 20mn-31%YoY SAIC-GM
of 16mn-188% SAIC-GM-Wuling of 17mn-194%YoY) GPM from new
car sales fell to 93% in 2019 from 115% in 2018 dragging down the bottom-
line The main factors that contribute to the GPM decline include the
emission standard switch the decline of NEV subsidy etc We expect its
2020E sales volume to be 579mn units (vs Companys target of 60mn)
The inflection point of short-term performance depends on the
performance of two GMs In 2019 SAIC-GM sales volume fell 188%YoY
of which Cadillac fell 173%Buick fell 137%Chevrolet fell 518% One of
the reasons is that SAIC-GM chose to use the three-cylinder engine in Buick
Excelle and Chevrolet Cruze in 2019 Since Feb 2020 SAIC-GM plans to
roll out the four-cylinder engine version on key models We expect the sales
performance of SAIC-GM will start to improve in 2H20E In addition SAIC-
GM-Wuling sales volume fell 199%YoY in 2019 We expect SAIC-GM-
Wuling will also improve marginally as New Baojun brand has a great
product pipeline in 2020E
In the medium-run SAIC-Volkswagen will support the performance
The SAIC-Volkswagen MEB plant is expected to be put into production in
4Q20E with a production capacity of 300K It will produce a variety of EV
models for Volkswagen koda and Audi In addition SAIC-Audi is expected
to roll out its first model A7L in 2021E We believe that Audi as one of the
We adjust down the top-line forecast in 2020E by 12% to RMB787bn to
reflect the negative impact of COVID-19 Furthermore we cut our bottom-
line forecast by 34% to RMB215bn in 2020E given 1) lower GPM forecast
2) operating deleverage 3) lower PL from JVs Therefore we cut our TP to
RMB211 (based on new 115x 20E PE) with an upside of 116% from initial
TP RMB256 (based on initial 92x 20E PE) Reiterate HOLD
