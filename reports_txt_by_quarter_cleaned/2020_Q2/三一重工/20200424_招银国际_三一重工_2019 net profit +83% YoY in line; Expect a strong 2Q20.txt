SANY Heavys net profit in 2019 surged 83% YoY to RMB 112bn in line with our
estimate of RMB111bn and within the range of RMB108-118bn released by
SANYs profit alert statement in Jan Operating cash inflow in 2019 increased 26%
YoY to RMB133bn above the net profit helped by good working capital
management Proposed DPS of RMB042 implied 314% payout ratio with the
absolute payout reaching a record high SANY targets to achieve RMB85bn
revenue in 2020E implying 12% YoY growth We maintain our bullish stance on
SANY as our check suggested that demand for excavators will likely exceed
expectations in 2Q which will serve as a key share price catalyst We have left
our earnings forecast unchanged Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB235
(based on 143x 2020E PE)
 Key highlights on 2019 results Revenue grew 36% YoY to RMB757bn in
2019 Revenue of concrete machinery excavator crane machinery grew
37%44%50% YoY Gross margin expanded 21ppt YoY to 327% driven
mainly by 46ppt margin expansion on concrete machinery Administrative
expense remained stable at RMB2bn despite the strong revenue growth
indicating stringent cost control RD expense increased by 108% YoY to
RMB36bn as SANY continued to invest in intelligent production and products
development Net profit surged 83% YoY to RMB112bn a historical high
 Off balance sheet liabilities increased but acceptable As at end-2019 the
financial guarantee exposure increased by 49% YoY to RMB23bn The growth
was broadly in line with the revenue growth Besides such amount remained
far below the peak level of RMB367bn reported in 2012 We believe the
overall risk is acceptable at present
 Key risks (1) Failure to contain COVID-19 (2) Risk of overseas business (3)
Increase in raw material cost (4) Risk of expanding to financing business
