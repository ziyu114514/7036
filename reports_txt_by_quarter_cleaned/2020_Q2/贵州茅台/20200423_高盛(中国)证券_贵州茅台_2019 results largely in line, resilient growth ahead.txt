Moutai reported 2019 results with Rev of Rmb888bn up 151%
yoy in line with expectation and NP of Rmb412bn was up 17% yoy
pre-announcement made on Jan 2
Key points of the result
In 4Q19 revenue was Rmb253bn up 14% yoy largely in line with
the growth momentum in 1-3Q of 2019 NP in 4Q19 increased by
3% yoy to Rmb107bn
For the full year of 2019 revenue from Moutai spirits came in at
Rmb758bn up 16% yoy GP margin was at at 938% In 2019 the
basic production volume of Moutai spirits was at at 49922 tons
Sales volume of Moutai spirits was 34546 tons up 65% yoy and
was 35% higher than our expectations We note that the full year
beginning of year plan of 31000 tons In our view this is further
its ability to respond to changes in the retail price environment and
market demand  This also implies a 104% ASP increase which is
2% lower than our expectations though mainly on lower than
expected direct sales We calculate that the ASP increase could be
attributed to four factors price hike lagged effect of 2% VAT cut
effect of 3% product mix upgrade of 4% and direct sales channel
effect of 1%
Sales to related parties (incl parent group and its subsidiaries) was
Rmb58bn in 2018 up from Rmb255bn in 2018 Sales to related
parties accounted for 43% of the net assets as end of 2019 and is
in line with our expectations
Nevertheless Its also worth noting that sales to the top 5 clients

was Rmb11bn (or 129% or total annual sales) up from only Rmb358bn in 2018 (or
487% of total annual sales) Excluding related parties sales (in the top 5 client list) the
sales to the other 4 clients was Rmb81bn 345x higher than the Rmb182bn in 2018
We believe this surge to large clients likely reects sales to local government-related
Revenue from series products (mid-to-low end) was Rmb954bn up 18% and GP
margin improved slightly to 72% In 2019 sales volume of 30082 tons up 1% yoy and
ASP was up 17% mainly due to direct price hike in addition to some products upgrade
Management guided to a at volume growth of series products in early 2020
2020 outlook
Looking forward into 2020 we expect basic production volume to increase by 7% to
54000 tons close to its current capacity of 56000 tons which is constrained in the
short term by the corona virus impact
could still maintain robust growth momentum thanks to its strong bargaining power
based on the differential between ex-factory price (at Rmn969) and wholesale price (at
Rmb2200 currently) per our channel checks
Dec 27 of 2019 Assuming that this is the annual in-plan supply plan we believe it may
be subject to additional out-of-plan supply in 2020 as seen in previous scal years
Market Series Per the reports each distributor was asked to pay cRmb25mn to the
1600 Moutai spirits distributors and that the ex-factory price as implied by the
15x higher than Feitian Moutai we calculate that it could contribute Rmb4bn revenue
(or c45% of the revenue in 2019) on 800-900 tons of volume (c25% of the sales
volume in 2019) all else equal
8% of total revenue) up 66% yoy and direct sales volume was 2651 tons (roughly 7%
of Moutai spirits volume) This is still lower than our expectation though and we attribute
this to the lower allocation of direct sales quota to the listco As per management the
the c1000 tons in 2019 We believe the overall direct sales ratio will continue to increase
in 2020 Meanwhile the sales to the parent group (or related party) should increase at
the growth rate of the net assets which is roughly 20% as per our estimate Its still
local-government related parties which at least in 2019 accounted for c11% of Moutai
spirits sales

Estimate changes valuation and key risks
We ne-tune our 2020-22E EPS by 1% on average and introduce our 2023E EPS of
Rmb6435 per share and we rollover our valuation to 2023E applying 27x (unchanged)
on 2023E EPS (previously on 2022E EPS) and discount back to 2020 using 85% COE
(previously 10% the change reected risk-free interest rate)  Our new-12m TP is raised
by c12% to Rmb1360 Maintain Buy (on CL)
Key risks 1) Further macroeconomic slowdown 2) lower-than-expected volume growth
3) government regulation on price hikes 4) ongoing coronavirus outbreak impact

GS Factor Prole
Returns and Multiple) Growth Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for specic metrics for each stock The
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute The precise calculation of each metric may
vary depending on the scal year industry and region but the standard approach is as follows
Growth is based on a stocks forward-looking sales growth EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for nancial stocks only EPS and sales growth) with a
pricedividend (PD) EVEBITDA EVFCF and EVDebt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for nancial stocks only PE PB and PD) with a higher percentile
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile Financial Returns
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile)
Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the scal year-end at least three quarters in the future Growth uses inputs
For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Prole please contact your GS representative
Across our global coverage we examine stocks using an MA framework considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary
factor into our price target and may or may not be discussed in research
