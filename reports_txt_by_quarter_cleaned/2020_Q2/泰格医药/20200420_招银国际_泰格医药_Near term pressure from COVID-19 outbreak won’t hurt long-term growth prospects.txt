Strong earnings growth in 2019 Tigermed reported inline 2019 results with
attributable net profit surged 78% YoY to RMB842mn which was mainly due to 1)
22% YoY revenue growth 2) RMB278mn one-off investment gains and fair value
gains and 3) spin-off of Shengtong (晟通) in Feb 2019 Core net profit rose 56%
YoY in 2019 to RMB658mn We estimate the organic revenue growth in 2019E
was around 27% YoY excluding impact from the Shengtong spin-off Gross
margin improved 34ppts to 465% in 2019 thanks to the spin-off of low margin
logistics business and improving operating efficiencies To factor in the impact
from COVID-19 outbreak we trimmed 2020E21E net profit forecasts by 17%11%
respectively and cut SOTP-based TP to RMB8718 implying 56x FY21E PE
 Short-term impact from COVID-19 outbreak The progress of clinical trials
in China was delayed due to the COVID-19 outbreak However hospitals in
most regions in China have resumed operation from Mar 2020 We think the
given that the virus outbreak in the US and Europe were more serious than in
China Tigermeds overseas orders could face some delays We noticed that
the daily increases in infections cases in the US and major European countries
have peaked recently Thus we believe the impact on Tigermeds overseas
business will last in short term
 Strong backlog growth indicates solid demand in high-quality clinical
CRO services Tigermed recorded RMB42bn backlog additions in 2019 up
28% YoY while the Company had RMB50bn backlogs as of end-2019 up 36%
YoY The number of ongoing clinical trials in China has been increasing fast
thanks to encouraging policies on drug innovation and pharma and biotech
participated in the development of 7 out of the 13 domestic innovative drugs
approved in 2019 demonstrating its leading position in Chinas CRO industry
 Global expansion opens up room for long-term growth Tigermeds
subsidiary DreamCIS will be listed in KOSDAQ which will further strengthen
the Companys presence in South Korea In Nov 2019 Tigermed announced
to establish a JV with Accerise to provide MRCT services in Japan Tigermed
capital raised overseas we believe Tigermed will accelerate the acquisition
process in global market

 Maintain BUY Tigermed disclosed preliminary 1Q20 results and its
attributable net profit rose 58-88% YoY due to one-off gains Core earnings
was largely flattish in 1Q20 due to the COVID-19 impact We trimmed our
forecasts and expect Tigrmeds adjusted net profit to grow 18%38%36% YoY
in 2020E21E22E respectively We like Tigermed given its leading industry
position and big overseas expansion potential
