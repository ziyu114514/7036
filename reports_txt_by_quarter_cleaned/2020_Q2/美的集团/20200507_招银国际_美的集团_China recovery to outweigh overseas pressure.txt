Resilient 1Q20 for Midea reflected by 1) strong export orders 2) relatively high
small appliances and online mix and 3) favorable input costs and FX rate
Exports may experience more pressure but China recovery should be healthy in
2Q-4Q20E Therefore we maintain BUY but cut TP to RMB 7280 based on 17x
FY21E PE (rolled over from 18x FY20E) vs China Intl peers avg of 16x 14x
 FY19 net profit inline Strong market share gains and GP margin
expansion Mideas FY19 NP att rose by 20% YoY 2% above 1% below
BBG CMBIS est Despite sales growth slowed to 7% YoY in 4Q19 NP att
accelerated to 24% YoY in 4Q19 aided by GP margin expansion on more AC
sales (market shares 4ppt to 29% for offline 7ppt to 30% for online in
FY19 ) more high-end product favorable FX and lower raw material cost
 1Q20 result was resilient and slightly better than industry Mideas 1Q20
NP att fell by 23% YoY fairly resilient and way better than its peers such as
Haier SHs -41% Supors -41% and Grees -69% The beat in our view was
due to 1) better product mix with less impact on small appliances vs large
appliances (eg AC was hit hard) and 2) strong exports orders of 26% YoY
 Guiding for a 3-5% decline in sales NP att in FY20E driven by a gradual
recovery in China and potentially bumpy export sales We find this target
achievable because 1) small appliances sales had already normalized in Apr
2020 and should do better as Midea plans to launch 28 new products in Jun
2020 2) AC price war may continue in FY20E but only at the expense of
smaller brands like AUX and others Midea still managed to gain shares even
with double digit decline in ASP in FY19 3) export orders cut suspension may
go up in 2Q-3Q20E (3% of FY20E sales as of Apr 2020) but should only be
limited given less than 20% sales exposure to US EU and 4) GP margin
should be stable which is well supported by falling costs and weakening CNY
environment However the robotic and automation sales (mainly KUKA) may
decline in FY20E since capex on technology upgrades by customers were
reduced due to the adverse macro environment
 Maintain BUY but trimmed TP to RMB 7280 (34% upside) We reiterated
BUY because 1) negatives are all priced in and recovery onwards shall be
healthy and 2) 1Q outperformance to will sustain into 2Q thanks to product
mix We cut FY20E 21E NP by 18% 11% to factor in sales drop due to virus
outbreak and cut in overseas orders Our new TP is based on 17x FY21E PE
(rolled over from 18x FY20E) The counter now trades at 16x 13x FY20E
21E PE (vs China peers avg of 16x) or 16x PEG (vs China peers 18x)
