LONGi reported strong FY191Q20 earnings results with net profit read
RMB5280mn1864mn up 1064%2051% YoY respectively We think the
strong growth momentum is about to face headwinds as impacts from COVID-
19 spreading around major solar installation market such as US and Europe will
emerge from 2Q20 Continuous price-cutting among the PV supply chain would be
an exhibit of demand disruption We think earnings visibility for FY20E is low implying
significant uncertainties for both product ASP and shipment volume We cut TP by
98% to RMB3123 to reflect ASP risks We think LONGi is fairly priced for now and
suggest staying on the sideline until recovery signal is confirmed Maintain HOLD
 Outstanding FY19 results LONGi recorded 496% YoY revenue growth in
FY19 to RMB329bn Strong revenue growth was driven by 1393%234%
mono wafer and module shipment YoY growth (see Figure 2) Overall GPM
was 289% up 67% YoY mainly backed by stunning wafer GPM of 322%
and module GPM of 252% Net profit was RMB528bn up 1064% YoY close
to high end of earnings preview
 Surprising good 1Q20 earnings To markets surprise LONGis strong
earnings growth momentum continued in 1Q20 with revenue surged 506%
to RMB8599mn and quarter net profit reached RMB186bn refreshing record
high In 1Q20 the Company maintained stable QoQ wafer sales and
significant decline in QoQ module shipment but manage to boost module
sales ASP through increasing module export to the US market According to
mgmt 450MW modules were ship to US market accounting for 24% of
quarter shipment which enjoyed significant pricing premium 1Q20 wafer and
module GPM were high at 397% and 225% respectively reflecting the
Companys effort in costs reduction and efficiency improvement
 Headwinds to emerge in 2Q20 Mgmt maintained FY20 wafermodule
shipment (internal usage incl) targets at 58GW20GW unchanged in view of 1)
8GW module order was secured and 2) optimistic outlook that order flow to pick
up as US and Europe to resume functional from city lockdown mode We are
afraid that the demand disruption will end LONGis stunning growth momentum
as wafermodule price had declined 147%41% since 25 Mar As market visibility
wafermodule ASP assumption down by 44%68% to RMB239pc and
RMB152watt reflecting FY20E GPM of 291%174% respectively
 Earnings growth to slow down in FY20E Based on our revised ASP and
costs assumptions we trim LONGis FY2021E EPS outlook by 76%27% to
RMB149180 Based on 21x FY20 PER we cut TP by 93% to RMB3123
LONGi is close to fairly priced given potential risks Maintain HOLD

Headwinds to emerge in 2Q20

 Accelerating wafer costs reduction in 2019 LONGi accelerated its wafer
costs reduction pace in FY19 Mgmt disclosed that 1) non-silicon ingots costs
had declined 2546% YoY and 2) non-silicon wafer cutting costs also declined
265% YoY We estimate overall non-silicon wafer costs dropped to
RMB091pc in 2019 Mgmt expects to have another 10% overall non-silicon
costs reduction in 2020 and explained further costs saving would be source
from a) thinner wafer and diamond wire for wafer thickness from 180m down
to 95% We think LONGi is currently leading in the costs race ahead of peers
and higher GPM achieved in 1Q20 was a good demonstration of its costs
leadership which helped the Company to sustain relatively stable profitability
in the potential price war
 Strong operating cash flow but somewhat stretching payables The
Company recognized operating cash inflow of RMB816bn in 2019
significantly increased from RMB117bn in 2018 We anticipate accounts
payable increment as one of the key drivers for operating cash inflow as the
account increased RMB52bn Mgmt explained payables in relation to solar
material manufacturing increased only RMB13bn which was a result of
expanding business scale while the remaining increment was largely due to
material and equipment related to new project expansion We think the
Company somewhat stretched payables in 2019 due to its massive CAPEX
plans but it would also be market consensus understanding that such strong
