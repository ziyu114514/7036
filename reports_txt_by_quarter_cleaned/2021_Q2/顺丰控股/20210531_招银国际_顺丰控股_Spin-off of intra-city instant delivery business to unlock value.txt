Whats new SF announced last Friday the plan to spin off the intra-city instant
delivery business on HKEX Dada Nexus (DADA US NR) a major peer is trading
at 5x 2021E EVSales and we estimate the valuation of SFs intra-city business
attributable to SF can potentially reach RMB235bn representing 8% of the
current market cap We believe a successful separate listing will help SF unlock
 Target to be spun off SFs intra-city instant delivery business is conducted
through Hangzhou SF Intra-City (杭州顺丰同城实业) At present SF has an
equity interest of 6676% in Hangzhou SF At as end-2020 SFs intra-city
instant delivery business covered 500 cities in China with riders reaching 2mn
 Key financials of Hangzhou SF According to the latest announcement of
SF Hangzhou SF generated RMB484bn revenue in 2020 (different from the
intra-city revenue of RMB315bn stated in 2020 annual report as internal
revenue is included) Net loss in 20201Q21 was RMB760mnRMB210mn As
at Mar 2021 the net asset of Hangzhou SF was RMB21bn
 Estimated valuation Based on our back-of-the-envelope calculation (due to
limited financial information available) the valuation of Hangzhou SF
attributable to SF can potentially reach RMB235bn (based on 5x 2021E
EVsales assuming revenue growth of 50% in 2021E)
 Maintain HOLD We expect continuous spending on business transformation
our long-term positive stance on SFs unique infrastructure network and good
management execution
 Upside risks (1) Better-than-expected earnings recovery in 2H21E (2)
recovery of parcel shipment ASP Downside risks (1) prolonged price war
(2) further increase in operating cost (3) higher-than-expected spending on
new business development
