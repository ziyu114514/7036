Shennan announced to expand substrate capacity (200mn FC-BGA 3mn panel
RFFC-CSP) in Guangzhou Total investment is RMB6bn of which fixed asset
investment will be over RMB58bn (1st2nd phase RMB 38bn2bn) We believe
revenue will start to contribute in FY2324E Meanwhile we are positive on PCB
demand pick-up in 3Q21E as China 3rd batch of 5G BTS deployment has kicked
off recently We raised our TP to RMB10192 as we rollover to 30x 2022E PE
Maintain HOLD given fair valuation and overhang on margin pressure
New capacity to capture upcycle of substrate market Shennan
announced to expand substrate capacity in Guangzhou production base
which will add 200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RFFC-CSP substrate
capacity We expect the new project to contribute revenue in 202324E
Shennans existing substrate capacity has been in full production since last
year driven by strong semiconductor demand We believe strong substrate
revenue will continue into 2H21E driving 22% YoY growth in FY21E
Demand for PCB to pick up in 2H21E Based on our recent checks despite
delay of bidding announcement of China 3rd batch of 5G BTS tenders in
1H21 China 5G BTS deployment has already kicked off (120k 26GHz by
CM 320k 35GHz21GHz by CUCT) CMCBN will also resume its 700MHz
5G BTS deployment (400k in 2 years) This week CBN has announced the
tender to transfer its 700MHz frequency band suggesting that CBN officially
started the cleanup work for 700MHz BTS deployment We believe PCB
drive Shennans PCB business to recover in 2H21E
Near-term cost pressure to continue 3M LME copper price is currently at
9488tonne slightly down 8% from its previous new high Although material
cost pressure has hindered willingness in production (especially for low-
margin consumer products) we expect material cost pressure to continue in
near term In the long run we believe top PCB players will enjoy scale benefits
and Shennan will gain share with accelerated industry consolidation
Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB10192 We raised our TP to
RMB10192 as we rollover to 300x FY22E PE (vs 30x FY21E prior) We
maintain HOLD given rich valuation and margin overhang
