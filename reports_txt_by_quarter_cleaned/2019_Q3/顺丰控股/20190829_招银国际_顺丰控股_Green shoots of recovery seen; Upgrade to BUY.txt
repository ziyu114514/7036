(Previous TP
UpDownside
SF posted revenue adj net profit increase of 20% 25% YoY in 2Q19 driven by
1) accelerated volume growth backed by new preferential services and 2)
rigorous cost control We believe most of negatives have been reflected in current
price and expect 1) solid business presence in various new initiatives and 2)
steady volume growth to boost further growth afterwards We raised FY19 20E
adj EPS by 8% 7% and upgraded it to BUY with TP of RMB4653 representing
39x 33x FY19 20E PE
 Bottom-line beat in 2Q19 Since new business progressed robustly and
volume growth recovered moderately in Jun revenue increased 19% YoY
in line with our est Adj net profit reached RMB1494mn (25% YoY) 16%
higher than our est due to 1) improved loading rate and 2) continued cost
cuts Looking into 2H19E we expect volume growth recovery to continue
backed by 1) share gain in midlow-end market and 2) further penetration
into fresh products and upmarket categories
 Bullish on new initiatives As pioneer in new business initiatives SF
progressed significantly through consistent heavy investment and close
cooperation with global logistics giants (eg DHL) Revenue contribution
from new business (cold chain heavy cargo supply chain and etc) shot up
from 16% in 1H18 to 24% in 1H19 Going forward we believe SFs first-
mover advantages will be better recognized in view of 1) brand recognition
among enterprise customers 2) economies of scale and 3) increasing entry
barriers against the backdrop of other major peers rushing to expand
presence in those fields under LT growth pressure
 Ample cash reserve to fuel Capex We expect Capex to be RMB11bn
RMB13bn in FY19 20E mainly for warehouses and civil airport Recently
CSRC approved SF to issue CB as much as RMB58bn and we believe it
would help mitigate the Companys financial pressure in NT After financing
we forecast the cash on hand will be amounted to RMB19bn by End -FY19
our estimate
 Upgraded to BUY with TP of RMB4653 We lifted our FY19-21E adj EPS
by 6-8% to reflect our upbeat outlook on volume recovery and new business
Therefore we upgraded it to BUY and raised TP to RMB4653 based on
33x FY20E PE (roll-over from previous 33x FY19E PE)
