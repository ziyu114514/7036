Henglis net profit in 1H19 grew 45% YoY to RMB671mn In 2Q19 net profit grew
12% YoY to RMB345mn which is largely in line with expectation as the weak
demand in 2Q had been expected Gross margin expansion is a surprise
suggesting that the pricing power of Hengli remains strong Besides operating
cash flow grew 31x YoY to RMB795mn in 1H19 higher than the net profit We
continue to like Hengli for its import substitution story on hydraulic cylinder pump
and valve The stock is now trading at 21x 2019E PE the mid-point of valuation
over the past two years
 Revenue grew 29% YoY to RMB279bn in 1H19 driven by (1) 25% YoY
revenue growth of hydraulic cylinder for excavator (2) 8% YoY increase in
non-standardized hydraulic cylinder for heavy equipment (3) 57% YoY
increase in other product revenue (helped by 100% YoY increase in hydraulic
pump and valve While revenue in 2Q19 grew only 3% YoY the weakness
has been largely expected
 Sales volume and ASP Henglis sales volume of hydraulic cylinder for
excavator grew 13% YoY to 256k units in 1H19 The growth was largely in line
with Chinas excavator sales volume growth of 14% according to CCMA data
Henglis non-standardized hydraulic cylinder increased 18% YoY to 786k
units Most importantly the ASP of hydraulic cylinder for excavator increased
11% YoY to RMB48k  unit
 Gross margin expansion a result of strong pricing power and product
mix improvement Gross margin expanded 24ppt YoY to 37% in 1H19 In
2Q19 the gross margin reached 399% up from 348% in 1Q19 Margin
expansion was the key reason for the earnings growth in 2Q19
 Operating cash flow grew significantly The 31x YoY in operating cash
flow was due to the Companys strong execution in cash collection
 Key risks  (1) weakness in demand for excavators (2) increase in
