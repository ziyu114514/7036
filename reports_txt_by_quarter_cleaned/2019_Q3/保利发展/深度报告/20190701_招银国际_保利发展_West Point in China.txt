Competitive advantage
High efficiency management team
Referring to the military culture Poly Development was built into a highly efficient
management structure The Company has a high execution power through the clear
defined responsibility scientific decision-making mechanism fair job duty appraisal
precise internal audit and organization monitoring Furthermore Poly Development
implements an attractive incentive scheme with share option and project investment plans

urbanization It receives ample harvest and enjoys steady growth by focusing business
development in property market In the past contribution from property development
always accounted for more than 90% Now the Company further expands business to
general property service and real estate fund On the one hand there is synergy as these
new business lines are related to property development business On the other hand it can
cultivate new earnings growth drivers
Focus on major city clusters
Poly Development focuses on the property market in the first and second tier cities as well
as major city clusters such as those in Pearl River Delta (PRD) Yangtze River Delta
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Central China Western China and West Strait Region For
optimization Poly Development would strengthen the business development in the robust
cities For example about 60% of GFA under development is located in the first and second
tier cities Another 30% is situated in the third and fourth tier cities where are adjacent to
the major city clusters Especially more than one-third of GFA under development is
located at the PRD In terms of product design more than 85% of properties for sales are
residential units or majority of residential units are having average GFA of less than 144
sq m that satisfied the demand for first time home buyers or first time upgraders
Integrated development of property related business
After many years of development Poly Development established multi channels for land
acquisitions including tendering auction listing MA co-operation urban renewal
parks landmark buildings signature towns and industrial parks All of these projects
enjoyed cost advantages

China Eastern China Central China Western China Northern China Northeast China
and overseas regions Southern China and Eastern China are the two most important
targeted markets together accounting for 65% of total revenue in FY18
Revenue recorded a 54% decline in FY17 This was mainly due to 40% decline of revenue
from Northern China in FY17 However revenue from Central China increased 60% during
China was lower than that in Southern China Thus although overall recognized GFA still
grew in FY17 because of increased GFA recognized from Central China overall
recognized ASP still dropped from RMB11652sq m in FY16 to RMB9948sq m in FY17

552%864%806% by FY161718 In 5M19 Poly Development achieved contracted
sales of RMB1890bn up 22% YoY However Poly Development has slowed down its
investment in land acquisition We believe this was mainly because of the Companys
cautious view on current land market as land premium is rising rapidly in 5M19Thus we
expect net gearing ratio to decrease in FY19 as the Company holds a stronger cash
position due to less investment

National property sales grew 61% in 5M19 but volume declined 16% Although new start
area grew 10% YoY land acquisition area and accumulated land auction premium reduced
332% and 356% YoY Construction expenditure is recovering backed by the large new
start area in 2H18 thus supporting the real estate investment (REI) in the near term
Market cooling down after MarApr
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released China property market data for 5M19
National property sales grew 61% YoY to RMB517tn but shadowed by 20ppt MoM growth
decline (4M19 81%) and 16% decline in sales volume We believe volume decline is
caused by weakening demand in tier 34 property market after its rally in 2017 and 2018
Feb 2017 to the same level of Feb 2014 Month for digestion has also dropped to 37
months Thus we do not expect an extensive policy relaxation or any strong stimulus to
property market But we expect local governments in second tier cities to marginally relax
housing policy in a timely manner to attract population and maintain local market stability

New start area grew 10% YoY while MoM growth slowed down by 26ppt in May
Furthermore land acquisition area and accumulated land auction premium significantly
reduced 332% and 356% YoY respectively It may reflect the prudent attitude of property
developers and weakening land market in thirdfourth tier cities Land acquisition area is a
leading indicator of new start area We expect new start area to continue to decelerate

REI grew 112% YoY for 5M19 slightly decelerating from 4M19 (119%) but still maintaining
a double-digit growth So far there is no data on 5M19 land expenditure and construction
expenditure But for 4M19 land expenditure and construction expenditure grew 297% and
56% YoY respectively For the past 10 months growth of land expenditure gradually
decelerated which is consistent with land auction premium However construction
expenditure or construction area on the other hand is recovering backed by the large new
start area in 2H18 Looking forward we think growth of construction expenditure will offset
the diminishing new start and support the REI in the near term

mortgage supply in the beginning of year and declined mortgage rate housing price in all
tiers of cities rose in 5M19 but in a very slow way Under current regulation framework of

Real estate market downturn
Poly Developments business and prospects depend on the performance of the PRC
property market  Property markets in where the Company has operation are affected by
local regional national and global factors including economic and financial condition
speculative activities in local markets demand for and supply of properties investor
confidence availability of alternative investment choices for property buyers inflation
government policies interest rates and availability of capital Any market downturn in China
generally or cities in which Poly Development has or expects to have operations may
materially and adversely affect the Companys business financial condition and results of
operations
Unfavorable housing policy
China property business is subject to extensive governmental regulation and in particular
sensitive to policy changes in the PRC property sector The PRC Government has
promulgated various control measures in recent years which aimed at cooling the property
sector and the government may adopt further measures to regulate this sector If local
governmental authorities adopt stricter regulation on property market in where Poly
Development has or expects to have operations it may have an adverse effect on the
Companys business financial position and results of operations
Tightened financing condition
Property development usually requires substantial capital investment throughout the
process of project development Poly Developments property development projects have
been generally funded through cash generated from operations including proceeds from
the pre-sale of its properties bank loans corporate bonds asset-backed securities
programs and other financing arrangements We expect the Company to continue to fund
its projects through these sources However it cannot be ensured that such funds will be
reasonable terms or at all Meanwhile the Company may experience negative net cash
flow from its operating activities in the future A negative net cash flow position for operating
activities could impair the Companys ability to make necessary capital expenditures
constrain operational flexibility and adversely affect its ability to expand business and
enhance liquidity
There are a large number of property developers in the PRC and we expect the level of
for land financing construction materials and skilled management and human resources
may result in increased cost for land acquisition and construction an oversupply of
properties available for sale a decrease in property prices a slowdown in the rate at which
new property developments are approved or reviewed by the relevant PRC Government
authorities and an increase in administrative costs for hiring or retaining qualified
operations and financial condition will suffer
Substantial level of borrowings
Poly Development maintained a substantial level of borrowings to finance its operations
during FY17 and FY18 As of FY161718 the Companys total outstanding interest-bearing
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
borrowings amounted to about RMB1122bn2047bn2637bn respectively Accordingly
its net gearing ratio as calculated by dividing total borrowings less cash and bank balances
and restricted cash by total equity was approximately 552%864%806% respectively
in FY161718 High indebtedness may increase the Companys vulnerability to adverse
conditions and limit its flexibility in the planning for or reacting to changes in the business
The schedules of the Companys project developments and whether a project can be
performance and efficiency of the Companys third-party contractors and its ability to
finance construction and the associated financing costs Construction delays or failure to
