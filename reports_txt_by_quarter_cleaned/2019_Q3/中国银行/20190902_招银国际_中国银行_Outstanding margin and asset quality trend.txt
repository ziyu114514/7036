On 30 Aug BOC reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 114bn up 45% YoY and
accounting for 604%629% of CMBISconsensus full-year estimates 1H19
PPoP had a decent growth of 81% YoY driven by strong tradinginvestment
2Q19 the Bank set aside less provisions offsetting a YoY surge in tax
expenses Therefore bottom-line earnings growth accelerated to 50% YoY in
2Q19 (vs 40% YoY in 1Q19) We initiate coverage on BOC A-share with
BUY rating
 Results positive 1) 2Q19 NIM edged up 2bp QoQ to 184% vs a
downward margin trend for other large banks This was attributed to
optimized asset mix and strict control in liability cost according to
managements explanation during results briefing 2) Demand deposit rose
72% HoH faster than total deposit growth of 55% HoH In particular retail
demand deposits expanded 115% HoH The proportion of total demand
deposit climbed 08ppt HoH to 495% 3) Asset quality improved notably
as NPL slid 2bp QoQ to 140% lowest among the Big-5 banks Both special
mention and overdue loans saw double-decline in 2Q19 NPL recognition
was more stringent as NPLs covered 1359% of 90-day overdue loans and
985% of total overdue loans (vs 1235% and 759% in 4Q18) 4) CAR was
supported by multi-channel capital replenishment BOC issued RMB
40bn perpetual bonds and RMB 73b preference share in 1H19 boosting
total CAR by 36bp HoH to 153%
 Results negative 1) Provision coverage dropped 71ppt to 1775%
lower than Big-5 average of 208% indicating less buffer to hold up earnings
exchange businesses 3) 1H19 annualized ROE declined 07ppt to 146%
as net profit growth remained subdued at 45% YoY
