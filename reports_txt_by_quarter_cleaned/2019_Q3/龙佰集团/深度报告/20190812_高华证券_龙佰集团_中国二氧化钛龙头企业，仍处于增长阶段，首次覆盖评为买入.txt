TiO2 market outlook supply  demand broadly balanced
Lomons cost leadership helps boost market share
Growth potential through consolidation and integration
Financials and valuations
龙蟒佰利 (002601SZ)
Lomon Billions (Lomon) was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2011 and is
specialized in the production and sale of TiO2 with over 30 years of TiO2 operational
experience Lomon is now the third-largest TiO2 producer globally in terms of capacity
and the top producer in China (21% market share) and Asia overall It was formed by the
merger between Henan Billions Chemical and Sichuan Lomon Titanium Industry in
325kt chloride process) representing c 9% of global capacity
Balanced TiO2 outlook TiO2 contributed 89% of Lomons gross profit in 2018 and its
share price has had a 07 correlation with TiO2 prices since listing in 2011 We see TiO2
supply rising though new capacity will be partly offset by some smaller sulfate TiO2
firms in China exiting the business China demand looks flat this year and should
normalize from next year back to 3%3% growth in 20202021E Costs should be stable
with only modest inflation risks (we expect gradual increases in ilmenite prices) Thus
while TiO2 prices may be volatile over the short term we expect them to be relatively
stable over our forecast period
Cost leadership to help consolidate market Lomon is the third-largest TiO2 producer
globally Its ASPs are above Chinese peers given its high-quality output and stable
production— and with its focus on chloride TiO2 product specialization and
differentiation we see upside for Lomons chloride TiO2 ASP over time After multiple
years of consolidation and integration Lomon has moved down the cost curve
through recycling of by-products 2) scale benefits vs smaller Chinese sulfate
producers and 3) supply of titanium from its own mines (at 50%) This enables it to
earn higher margins vs peers it is just behind Chemours the global leader
Positive on volume growth potential After ramping up the 200kt phase 2 chloride unit in
Henan and the 60kt chloride unit in Yunnan (just acquired) Lomon said it will start
re-configuring its existing 60kt phase 1 chloride unit in Henan (to 100kt) and might start
a new greenfield project (100-200kt) potentially in HenanSichuanYunnan As well as
organic growth Lomon has mentioned its interest in looking for acquisition targets given
that some existing smaller TiO2 producers are interested in exiting the market This is in
line with its target of growing capacity from 600kt (2018) to 1150kt within three years
Lomon is also investing vertically by acquiring titanium mines (upstream feedstock) and
investing in high-end titanium sponge and titanium alloys (downstream applications)
Financialsvaluation We forecast revenue and EBITDA CAGRs of 18% and 20%
respectively during 2018-2021E mainly driven by 20% sales volume CAGR with almost
flattish price forecast supporting 8% free cashflow yield and 7% dividend yield (at 75%
payout) in 2019E We apply 75X EVEBITDA (average since 2016) on 2020-2021
blended average EBITDA to derive a 12-month price target of Rmb190 which implies
36% upside
龙蟒佰利 (002601SZ)
Catalysts We believe the stock should re-rate as Lomons new capacity growth is
delivered and starts contributing to earnings in 202021E Any news on supply
consolidation would be positive for Lomon given its leading position (both in capacity
increase (in September) might also be a near-term catalyst
Key risks Lower-than-expected TiO2 prices worse-than-expected utilisation at new
chloride plants insufficient feedstock supply for chloride TiO2 regulatory changes on
environmental regulations operational risks increased free float increase and forex
What is TiO2 and how is it made Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a white pigment widely
used in paints plastics paper making printing inks etc There are two main production
technologies sulfate process (mainly in China) and chloride process (mainly outside
feedstock plus sulfuric acid The chloride process uses rutile or purer ore (higher
titanium concentration) as the major feedstock plus chlorine gas Rutile TiO2 has better
weatherability and opacity making it more suitable for outdoor coatings plastics
advanced paper coatings etc The biggest customers are paint and coatings firms such
as PPG Nippon Paint and Akzo Nobel

TiO2 market outlook supply  demand broadly balanced
Overall we see Ti02 supply rising though new capacity will be partly offset by some
smaller firms who are using sulfate technology exiting the business Demand looks flat
this year and should normalize from next year back to 3%3% growth in 20202021E
Costs should be stable with only modest inflation risks (we expect gradual increases in
ilmenite prices) Thus while prices may be volatile over the short term we expect them
to be relatively stable over our forecast period
Supply — China is adding new TiO2 supplies
China Most are chloride TiO2 units since China has banned new project approvals for
smaller plants first for testing before making further larger investments Moreover there
relatively new technology in China) We forecast Chinas TiO2 capacity will grow by
About 10% of Chinas capacity has per-unit capacity below 50kt and over 10 years of
operations This portion of supply in our view is subject to closure as we see the
tightening of emissions standards (particularly for solid waste and waste acid disposal)
which smaller operations might find difficult or uneconomic to meet
Outside of China some global TiO2 producers have mentioned targets for
de-bottlenecking — for instance Chemours said it targets to increase its capacity by
10% by 2021
Since most of Chinas titanium reserves are in the form of ilmenite (lower grade and
cheaper titanium ores) instead of rutile (higher concentration) China has so far focused

on the TiO2 sulfate production process (it now accounts for c90% of Chinas
capacity) There are only a few chloride-process TiO2 plants operating in China with
only two (at Lomon Billions and Jinzhou Titanium) running at normal utilisation rates
The others are either in production suspension or running at low utilization
Demand — stable pending further recovery
Most TiO2 is used in paints and coating materials and demand is therefore highly
dependent on the property cycle and coating demand Globally we assume TiO2
demand will see a c2% CAGR over 2019-21E tracking slightly lower than global GDP
growth (GSe 3% in the same period) For China we assume TiO2 demand for 2019 to
be flat yoy to account for the year-to-date weak TiO2 demand and lower property GFA
sold vs last year We forecast demand growth could normalize from next year back to
3%3% growth in 20202021E c 3% below our China GDP forecasts

Costs — under control
Titanium ore (mainly ilmenite) accounts for about 15% of Lomons TiO2s production
costs (the rest being energy costs and other raw materials) There have been no
material changes in global titanium ore prices in recent years (at roughly
US150-200ton) Hence the cost structure at Lomon remains fairly stable for both
chloride and sulfate TiO2 According to Lomon they are able to control the cost of
making sulfate TiO2 at around Rmb12-13kton with chloride TiO2 generally Rmb1-2k
more expensive ie at Rmb13k-14kton
Our Australia resources analyst Paul Young expects prices for titanium ores (both rutile
and ilmenite) to go up modestly in 20202021E Rutile refers to high-concentration
titanium ores (95-97%) feedstock for chloride TiO2 plants Ilmenite has a low
concentration of TiO2 (50-60%) and is feedstock for sulfate TiO2 plants Lomon mainly
imports chloride slag for the chloride TiO2 unit if there are insufficient supplies
domestically in China Paul Young forecasts a gradual increase in ilmenite prices at

Prices — China outlook remains challenging in near term
Chinas domestic TiO2 prices have fallen by 8% year-to-date from c Rmb17000ton
at the start of the year to c Rmb15300ton now There was some demand recovery in
March but sentiment shifted quickly and inventory re-stocking appeared to be temporary
only The weak demand in 2Q (consistent with the broader economic slowdown and
We expect the 2H19 outlook to remain challenging given additional supply from new
plants and still-sluggish demand growth On the supply side we will see new TiO2
up production (and will account for c 80kt incremental supply in 2019 based on the
the corporates inventory for TiO2 is slightly higher than normal and we have not yet
seen any signals of demand recovery or a repeat of the restocking that we saw in March
this year
A potential boost in price might occur around September this year due to a seasonal
pick-up in demand (with seasonally better economic activities in areas such as property
and infrastructure)
For the rest of this year we expect volatility in prices with the slighter weaker
supplydemand outlook set against a seasonally stronger September — but overall we
expect relatively stable prices over our forecast period

Lomons cost leadership helps boost market share
Lomon is a leading global operator in Ti02 with a high-end client base Its ASPs are
above Chinese peers given its high-quality output — and with its focus on chloride TiO2
product specialization and differentiation we see upside for Lomons chloride TiO2
ASP over time After multiple years of consolidation and integration Lomon has moved
peers it is just behind Chemours the global leader
Lomon was listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2011 and is specialized in the
production and sale of TiO2 with over 30 years of TiO2 operational experience — we
note TiO2 accounted for 84% of revenue and 89% of gross profit in FY18 It was formed
by the merger between Henan Billions Chemical and Sichuan Lomon Titanium Industry
in October 2016
Capacity Lomon is now the third-largest TiO2 producer globally in terms of capacity
and the top producer in China (21% market share) and Asia overall It has four main
production hubs Henan Jiaozuo Sichuan Deyang Hubei Xiangyang and Yunnan Xinli
of TiO2 capacity (540kt sulfate process 325kt chloride process) representing c 9% of
global capacity
Lomon owns an ilmenite mine in Sichuan and titanium smelters to supply 50% of the

For the newly acquired Yunnan Xinli TiO2 plant it could take some time (easily over six
months) to re-start the production process for a stable supply of chloride TiO2 That

The ASP of Lomons TiO2 is generally higher than at Chinese peers Its chloride TiO2

Growth potential through consolidation and integration
Lomon is taking market share given its low cost base It is growing its own capacity and
also in the market for consolidation opportunities It is also looking to own more of its
feedstock while also diversifying its applications
Organic growth to gain market share
Lomon has delivered strong operational performance at its phase 1 Henan chloride TiO2
plant (running at c100% utilization in 20172018) The chloride pigments have earned a
customers including PPG and Nippon Paint
ramp up utilization in 20192020 (achieving 80kt production in 2019) Lomons success
in developing and operating chloride TiO2 technology (not new to the global players)
helps it gain market share and first-mover advantage in China
This could accelerate the phase-out of the China sub-scale sulfate TiO2 plants that were
built over 10 years ago (some are already at their break-even level due to scale and cost
constraints) According to our channel checks with the local TiO2 suppliers there are
environment and stricter environmental regulations
Inorganic growth for market consolidation
Lomon has mentioned their interest in looking for acquisition targets given that some
existing TiO2 producers are interested in exiting the market On the chloride side
opportunities globally On the sulfate side Lomon mentioned that it could be difficult to
acquire existing players unless there is high certainty of being able to run the plant
waste and waste acid disposal regulations
A lot to achieve in 2020
In order to achieve its production targets in line with guidance Lomon needs to ramp up
its new Henan phase 2 200kt chloride TiO2 unit and the acquired Yunnan 60kt chloride
Henan phase 1 60kt chloride TiO2 unit to 100kt and build new production sites totalling
capacity of 200kt of chloride TiO2 They have assessed the coastal areas for their new
production sites but found it still more economical to be close to the feedstock sources
instead As such if they were to expand it would likely to be in Sichuan or Yunnan
areas where most of Chinas titanium ore is located
龙蟒佰利 (002601SZ)
Owning more of its feedstock
Lomon owns some titanium ore assets in Sichuan with annual production of 800ktpa
feedstock for its TiO2 plants Lomon is focused on its feedstock bottlenecks (most China
resources are low-grade ilmenite) by converting ilmenite to titanium slag  synthetic
rutile Having its own mines and converters can minimize feedstock cost volatility and
new 30ktpa ilmenite-to-titanium-slag converter in 2021E
Diversifying applications
We think Lomons expansion into titanium sponge and titanium alloy is a rational
move but not an easy one (announced in May 2019) The move looks rational because
it helps diversify the downstream applications to offer more flexibility in the production
planning process However the titanium alloy market (medium to low end) is full of
titanium mine players and margins are low
We think the market for high-end titanium alloy (eg used in aerospace industries) is
where the opportunities  margins are — but this also presents further difficulties for new
entrants due to the need for RD and lengthy end-market verification processes It is
likely a longer-term revenue growth driver for Lomon in our view
龙蟒佰利 (002601SZ)
Financials and valuations
Growth We forecast Lomon will post revenue and EBITDA CAGRs of 18% and 20%
respectively during 2019-2021E mainly driven by the 20% sales volume CAGR after
Margins We expect the TiO2 market to be largely balanced with utilization improving
slightly in 2020E and 2021E (based on the China TiO2 supply  demand outlook)

Gearing Lomon Billions has a solid balance sheet with what we see as healthy
leverage (c 20% net debt to equity) We forecast a gradual decline in gearing as the
cash returns start to improve and capex stabilizes at Rmb1bn pa in 20202021E
projects in 2019 and a generally higher utilisation for TiO2 plants
Capex We forecast Lomons capex at Rmb15bn in 2019E (to include the acquisition
of the Yunnan chloride TiO2 business in June) and then to stay at Rmb1bn pa during
2020-21E to fund new chloride TiO2 plants
Dividend We forecast Lomons strong cashflow profile and balance sheet should be
supportive for its c 80% dividend payout as per guidance This gives yields much
higher than most firms in the chemicals space We also think the high payout is a
function of the difficulties faced by the industry in getting new spending plans approved
considering the stringent environment regulations

Our 12-month price target of Rmb190 is based on 75X forward EVEBITDA (applied to
a simple average of 2020E21E EBITDA) discounted back by one year at 10% (our
estimate of Lomons WACC) We use EVEBITDA as our primary valuation
methodology as we think it is a better way to value the cash-generating ability for

The stock is trading below average EVEBITDA PE and PB levels since 2016 in our
view partly because the market lacks confidence Lomon can successfully ramp up their
new chloride TiO2 capacity on time There are also concerns around the property
market recovery signals in recent months based on GFA sold data points

TiO2 prices (-) Lower-  higher-than-expected TiO2 prices due to supply  demand
dynamics are large risk factors A key downside risk is weaker-than-expected TiO2
demand (driven mainly by the property cycle) Upside risks would include
slower-than-expected ramp of new China TiO2 supplies and further supply
consolidation due to stringent environmental controls
Worse-than-expected utilisation at new chloride plants (-) Lomons new chloride
capacity additions might face potential delays and production issues which are very
generally conservative corporate operational management in terms of safety and project
planning could mean the ramp-up of capacity additions may be slower than expected
Insufficient feedstock supplies for chloride TiO2 (-) Chloride TiO2 requires
high-concentration titanium ores as feedstock Lomon is building a new
could mean Lomon has to source its feedstock from external suppliers for a longer
Regulatory changes (-) The TiO2 production process is highly polluting For instance
sulfate TiO2 produces a large amount of sulfuric acid which is converted into solid
waste for disposal Any changes to government policy preferences on new supplies of
TiO2 or future supply consolidation (particularly in the sulfate TiO2 segment) will be
critical in the demand  supply balance Based on the recent rounds of government
supervisions across provinces on plant emissions we saw no pull-back in government
moves to be more environmentally friendly
Operational risks (-) The chemicals industry is a high-risk business handling lots of
toxic and explosive materials There are occasionally accidents  explosions that could
on Chinese chemicals plants to monitor emissions and safety would also count as
potential risks

post the merger) will see their lock-up period expire on September 20 2019 The free
float (including major shareholders) will increase by about 1322mn shares out of a total
outstanding of 2032mn shares We believe this could be a near-term downside risk
unless there are any strategic investors interested in the blocks There have been no
material changes in shareholder structure in the past few years
Foreign exchange risk (-) About 50% of Lomons revenue is from TiO2 overseas
sales (as of 2018) Similar to total China TiO2 exports it supplies to a wide range of
countries According to Lomon any Rmb appreciation  depreciation would be
negativepositive to Lomon because it would lower  increase export sales

Across our global coverage we examine stocks using an MA framework considering
both qualitative and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to
target 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%)
considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target and may or
may not be discussed in research
Under our MA framework for the Asia-Pacific Energy and Chemical sector we
recognize a myriad of factors could influence the probability of a deal and our regional
Regulation on ownership that prohibits or discourages acquisitions including by a
foreign entity on grounds of national security
realization of planned synergy and restructuring upside
Management stance in terms of openness to a deal (eg being a target of
acquisition management buyout) especially by government appointees
entry barrier (eg monopoly) or a low-cost structure
Industry attractiveness based on a growing profit pool as a function of asset
expansion revenue growth or profitability improvement
Within this context we have ranked Lomon Billions a 3 and weight our MA value
by 0% (reflecting the probability implied by this ranking) within our price target

What is TiO2
Titanium Dioxide (TiO2) is a white pigment widely used in paints plastics paper making
printing inks etc The global TiO2 industry has been developed for more than a hundred
years while Chinas TiO2 industry began in 1956 Pigment-grade TiO2 production only
started in China in the 1980s and 1990s China now plays an important role in the global
TiO2 market (at c 50% of global capacity)
There are two main production technologies for TiO2 sulfate process (mainly in China)
and chloride process (mainly outside China) The sulfate process uses ilmenite (a
sulfur) The chloride process uses rutile or purer ore (higher titanium concentration at
80% or above) as the major feedstock plus chlorine gas Rutile TiO2 has better
weatherability and opacity making it more suitable for outdoor coatings plastics
advanced paper coatings etc The biggest customers are the paint and coating
Since most of Chinas titanium reserves are in the form of ilmenite (lower grade and
cheaper titanium ores) instead of rutile (higher concentration) China has so far focused
on the TiO2 sulfate production process (it now accounts for c90% of Chinas
capacity) There are only a few chloride-process TiO2 plants operating in China with
only two (Lomon Billions and Jinzhou Titanium) running at normal operating rates The
others are either in production suspension or running at low utilization
