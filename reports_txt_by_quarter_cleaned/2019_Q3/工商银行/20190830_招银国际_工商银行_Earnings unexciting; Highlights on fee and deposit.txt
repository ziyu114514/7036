On 29 Aug ICBC reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 1679bn up 47% YoY and
accounting for 537%544% of CMBISconsensus full-year estimates 2Q19
offset a higher tax expense due to low-base effect in 2Q18 As a result bottom-
line earnings growth accelerated to 52% YoY in 2Q19 (vs 41% YoY in 1Q19)
The Bank will hold result briefing and reverse road show on 3-4 Sep in Beijing
We initiate coverage on ICBCs A-share with BUY rating
FY18 2) Deposit growth was strong at 80% HoH the fastest among large
banks and outpacing loan growth of 55% HoH therefore sending LDR down
by 17ppt HoH to 704% 3) Asset quality continued to improve as NPL
ratio fell 3bp QoQ to 148% and provision coverage climbed 62ppt to 192%
Overdue loan and special mention loan ratio declined 7bp and 21bp to 168%
and 271% respectively  4) Lower RWA density as RWA grew at a slower
pace (07% QoQ) than that of total assets (25% QoQ) likely due to faster
growth in retail vs corporate loans
 Results negatives 1) 2Q19 NIM contracted 4bp QoQ to 227% in line with
other large bank peers Liability cost was up 10bp HoH on deposit cost hike
more than offsetting the 5bp expansion in asset yield That said 1H19 NIM
only retreated 1bp YoY vs 7bp YoY slip for CCB (939 HK BUY) 2) CIR rose
06ppt YoY in 2Q19 possibly due to higher expense on technology
development 3) Annualized ROE in 1H19 declined 08ppt to 147% given
the subdued earnings growth
