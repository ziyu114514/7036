2 September 2019
上半年業績繼續高增長34%
上海機場公佈2019 上半年財報，公司實現營業收入5455 億元，同比增長2111%，實
現歸屬於上市公司股東的淨利潤2700 億元，同比增長3354%，實現每股收益14
元。實現扣非淨利潤265 億元，同比增長3109%。
上半年上海機場的生産經營指標總體向好，航空性收入錄得2024 億元，同比增長
30%，其中架次相關收入879 億元，同比增長21%，主要受益於飛機起降架次同比增
長192%；旅客及貨郵收入1145 億元，同比增長377%，主要受益于旅客吞吐量同比
增長42%。上半年旅客吞吐量排名中國第二，其中國際和地區旅客量繼續保持全國第
一。在寬體機比重不斷擴大的趨勢下，我們預計航空性業務收入同比增長保持在低個
2019 上半年，公司的非航空性收入343 億元，同比增長351%，占總收入的比重達到
629%。其中商業餐飲收入錄得277 億元，按年大增460%，其他非航收入66 億元，
按年增長27%。由於2019 年首季開始，浦東T2 航站樓免稅店開始採用新提成率
425%，較2018 年的25%大幅提升了175 個百分點，而上半年上海機場免稅銷售額實
現70 億元左右，同比增長約27%，扣點率提升及銷售額增長大幅提振了上海機場非航
業務的盈利能力，是業績勁升的主要推力。今年四季度浦東衛星廳免稅店將開業以及
T2 入境免稅店也將投入使用，免稅經營面積將繼續擴大，上海機場的免稅業務收入仍
折舊下降，毛利率繼續增厚
上半年營業總成本同增93%，低於收入增速119 個百分點，整體毛利率較去年同期提
升50 個百分點至564%。折舊攤銷成本則因部分固定資産折舊年限到期，折舊費用下
降而同比減少11%。
浦東機場三期擴建項目衛星廳S1S2 預期將於今年九月投産，將增加免稅面積9062 平
方米，T1，T2 航站樓也將新開1000 平方米的免稅店面積，在擴大免稅業務經營面積
的同時也有望提高旅客購物體驗，充分釋放公司作爲龍頭樞紐機場的估值溢價。
另外，近期上海自貿區臨港新片區總體方案提出支援浦東國際機場建設世界級航空樞
紐，打造區域性航空總部基地和航空快件國際樞紐中心，作爲航空交通樞紐的上海機
場有望因此首先受益。
基於強勁的非航業務收入增長預期，我們調整上海機場20192020 年的每股EBITDA 預
測值，提高目標價爲人民幣93 元，分別對應2322 倍的估值倍數，維持增持評級。
