上汽集團 (600104CH)
中國  汽車製造  更新報告
26 July 2019
2019 上半年集團累計銷量2937 萬輛，同比减少1662%。由于加大了車型促銷力度，
上汽通用的銷量表現較好，跌幅有所收窄；上汽大眾上汽乘用車繼續下滑但零售端有
恢復；上汽通用五菱繼續承壓。我們認為，强產品周期的合資品牌如上海大眾，是公
司業績保持穩健及好于行業平均的主要支持；在行業景氣度持續低迷、車市降價壓力
大的背景下，公司的自主品牌擴張之路或將受到一定的挑戰。
受宏觀經濟增速放緩、中美貿易摩擦、消費信心下降等因素影響，2019 年國內車市持
續低迷，前六月國內乘用車批發銷量同比下滑 14%，同時國五國六標準切換和汽車刺
激政策仍在醞釀令潜在購買者觀望心態加重，汽車批發銷量月同比錄得連續數月雙位
上汽集團公布的銷量數據顯示：2019 上半年集團累計銷量2937 萬輛，同比减少
1662%。其中上汽大眾出貨量919 萬輛，同比下降99%；上汽通用銷量834 萬輛，
同比下降129%；上汽通用五菱銷量744 萬輛，同比下降292%；上汽乘用車銷量
311 萬輛，同比下降132%。總體來看，由于加大了車型促銷力度，上汽通用的銷量
表現較好，跌幅有所收窄；上汽大眾上汽乘用車繼續下滑但零售端有恢復；上汽通用
為加快國五車型去庫存，上汽集團前期加大支持力度，推出了30 億紅包優惠，支持上
海地區國三及以下排放標準汽車以舊換新。在現有車型的終端折扣加大的支持下，終
端需求在六月已經有所好轉，我們預計下半年隨著基數回落，同比降幅將逐步收窄。
上汽大眾2019 年的新車型包括T-Cross、全新一代Polo、全新速派、途昂COUPE，上
汽通用將推出全新昂科拉、布雷澤、凱迪拉克CT4CT5XT6 等，在新能源車型方面合
資方也將逐步覆蓋現有車型的混動版本和全新純電版本。上汽榮威的RX5 MAX 即將上
市，榮威和名爵各有多款新能源車型推出。我們認為新車型的密集投放和國六車型售
價回升將會有助于公司下半年整體單車價格的改善。
我們認為，國內車市的减速除了多年高速增長、基數擴大後自身調整的需要外，宏觀
經濟環境放緩和中美貿易戰打壓了消費信心是重要原因，再叠加排放標準升級和新能
源補貼大幅退坡的行業政策加劇了行業洗牌。從新車型申報和現有車型儲備來看，未
來行業格局向頭部車企集中的趨勢將愈加明顯，利好市占率領先、研發投入充足、產
品譜系完整的行業龍頭，公司有望在下半年車市復蘇中處于一個相對有利地位。
我們保守預計上汽20192020 年EPS 為277297 元，考慮到公司相對較高的現金分紅
率也是維持穩定估值水平的保障，調整目標價至253 人民幣元，對應20192020 年
9185 倍預計市盈率，1211 倍預計市淨率，持有評級。(現價截至7 月24 日)
