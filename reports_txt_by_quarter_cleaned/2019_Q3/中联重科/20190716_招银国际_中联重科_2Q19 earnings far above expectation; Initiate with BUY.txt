SUMMARY The positive alert issued by Zoomlion last Friday implied 19x-25x
YoY increase in net profit in 2Q19 This is far above expectations as the net
profit range of RMB24-27bn in 1H19 already accounted for 72-82% of the full
year consensus forecast We forecast Zoomlion to deliver 95%14% earnings
growth in 2019E and 20E Initiate with BUY and TP of RMB670 based on
13x 2019E target PB
 Explosive earnings growth in 2Q19 Zoomlion announced that its
preliminary net profit in 1H19 is expected to surge 172x-212x to RMB24-
27bn (based on PRC GAAP) The impressive growth was driven by (1)
property and infrastructure construction that boosted the concrete and crane
equipment (2) the strong demand for Zoomlions core products such as
pump truck tower crane and construction crane (3) reduction of expense
ratios In 2Q19 the implied net profit range is RMB14-17bn representing
19x-25x YoY growth and 39-69% QoQ growth
 Staying positive on both crane and concrete machinery According to
CCMA data sales volume of truck crane (9 major players in China) surged
63% YoY in 5M19 and we believe Zoomlion delivered higher-than-average
growth We believe the potential improvement in infrastructure spending and
NES upgrade should continue to boost demand for truck crane going
forward On the other hand demand for tower crane and concrete
machinery are more driven by property construction that has been improving
since early this year In particular for tower crane we expect Zoomlion to
gain market share from the smaller players
 Earnings growth of 95%14%4% in 2019E-21E Our revenue growth
forecast for 2019E20E21E are 46%10%7% We expect gross margin to
continue to expand in 2019E-20E Besides we assume significant operating
leverage effect to boost the earnings growth
 Initiate with BUY Our TP of RMB670 is based on 13x 2019E target PB
on the back of 10-12% ROE in 2019E-21E We benchmark Zoomlion-As
earnings raised by the market in the near term (2) continuously strong
