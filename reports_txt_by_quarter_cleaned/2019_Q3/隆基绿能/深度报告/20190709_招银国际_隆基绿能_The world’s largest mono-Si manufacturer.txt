SUMMARY LONGi is the worlds largest manufacturer of PV monocrystalline
silicon wafer cells and module The Company received well recognition from A-
share market and has the largest market capitalization among global peers
Based on close examination on market trend product supplies and demand we
solar giant in the solar farm grid-parity era
 Mono-Si demand is picking up with grid-parity trend As non-module costs
for PV farm development is more significant in recent years downstream PV
development calls for a suitable technology to offer higher We believe mono-
Si cell is currently the best available technology to answer the call with
efficiency up to 267% Market data from CPIA and ITRPV confirmed the trend
favors mono-Si products as mono-Si module had gained market share to 40-
45% in 2018
 Tight supply for high-efficiency mono wafer We believe mono wafer
supply will likely be tight in 2019-20E as market demand focus shifts to PERC
cells technology We estimate mono-Si wafer demand to reach
69GW88GW109GW in 2019-21E with PERC capacity reaching 100GW We
expect PECR cells capacity will outpace mono-wafer supply and that will lead
to tight supply in 2019-20E As such we expect leading mono-Si wafer
suppliers to maintain full production and sales in 2019-21E
 Second mover advantages and expanding at a good timing We believe
declining upstream Poly-Si costs 2) stable product ASP outlook 3) low costs
CAPEX for future expansion we expect LONGi to enjoy good returns from
capacity growth with relatively stable ASP and GPM and that will increase
LONGis earnings visibility
 Initiate BUY with TP of RMB280 We expect LONGi to deliver EPS CAGR
of 207% in 2019-21E with EPS of RMB122142178 respectively Given

Mono-Si demand is picking up with grid-parity trend
The trend was established under the background of rapid costs reduction from market
prices had declined with a pace of 282% and 276% respectively per year from 2015 to
2018 According NRELs publication of US Solar PV System Costs in 1Q18 PV module
distributed PV system in the US The significant change urged PV industry to explore
means to further reduce overall system costs and the answer of the key is efficiency PV
development calls for a suitable technology to offer higher photovoltaic transmission rate
while maintaining costs-efficiency

film and Perovskite technologies For the past decade market had put multi-Si module
module had maintained 1-15ppt efficiency rate leading ahead of multi-Si module while we
observed mono-Si products had achieved faster cost reduction pace from technology
breakthrough in the past five years which kicked off a trend for high-efficiency mono-Si
product to replace traditional multi-Si module

Mono-Si has been gaining market shares from 2015
efficiency is obvious Higher PV module efficiency represents higher power concentration
in a unit size of solar panel and that helps solar farm investors save considerable costs
from balance-of-system (BOS) land or rooftop acquisition and lands labor installation
costs as well as some other overhead costs According to our understanding we believe
the higher non-module costs for a solar farm the higher possibility that project owner will
select a mono-Si panel and more willing to pay for a premium for those extra power offered
by the high-efficiency products According to PSE GmbH mono-Si module had reversed
its shrinking trend since 2015 and exhibited significant market shares gaining thereafter
CPIA and ITRPVs estimates also suggest mono-Si module had a market penetration rate
of 40-45% in 2018 and mono-Sis market share will expand further in 2019-21E to 53-55%

Competition landscape
Solar wafer sales is currently operating in an oligopoly market structure after years of
Zhonghuan Semiconductor (ZHS 002129) and GCL Poly (3800 HK HOLD) and several
integrated solar module manufacturers such as Jinko (JKS US) and Canadian Solar (CSIQ
US) with their own wafer supply LONGi and ZHS are key participants dominating duopoly
mono-Si wafer market while GCL Poly focuses on multi-Si wafer manufacturing We
estimate LONGi ZHS GCL Poly will have effective wafer output of 316GW 25GW and
25GW respectively and the other integrated module manufacturer will produce 30GW
wafer output to fulfill internal module orders As we expect global PV installation demand
will reach 115GW in 2019 we believe solar wafer demand is largely fulfilled by those key
wafer manufacturers and integrated module leaving considerable oversupply from those
traditional independent wafer manufacturers
Tight supply for high-efficiency mono wafer
We are not particularly worried about the oversupply of solar wafer however as we believe
mono wafer supply will likely be tight in 2019-20E especially when we shift demand focus
on PERC cells production capacity PERC stands for Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact
It is currently the costs effective high-efficiency PV cell technology and has been adopted
in large scale since late 2017 According to our channel check PERC production line
requires CAPEX at RMB300mn per GW Given considerable pricing premium for mono-
Si products over multi-Si products we expect PERC cells manufacturers to have
preference in selecting mono-wafer for their brand new PERC cells investment and that
will boost mono-Si wafer demand
In 2019-21E we forecast global PV installation will reach 115133153GW representing a
demand CAGR of 137% from 2018-21E Based on the assumption of 10% pipeline PV
module inventories as well as mono-Si wafer penetration rate of 55%60%65% in 2019-
21E we estimate mono-Si wafer demand to reach 69GW88GW109GW in 2019-21E
respectively representing a 2018-21E CAGR of 343% In the PERC cells manufacturing
end however PERC capacity had reached 60GW by 2018 and market expects the figure
will likely to reach above 100GW by end-2019 significantly higher than our mono-Si wafer
demand projection We expect PECR cells capacity outpace mono-Si output growth will
also boost mono-Si wafer demand and lead to tight supply in 2019-20E and undersupply

Investment highlights
Costs leadership ensures superior profitability
We believe LONGis continuous focus on costs leadership is a key leading to the
Companys superior profitability and long-term success We summarize four key aspects
of LONGis costs control measures including
1) locating mono-Si rod production facilities in low electricity costs areas LONGi
was one of first movers to set up mono-Si rod and wafer production in Ningxia and
Yunnan to utilize low electricity costs in those areas
2) forming strategic partnership with major production equipment suppliers to
lower capacity expansion costs as well as unit product depreciation
3) continuous RD investment brought successful technology breakthrough which
led diamond wire saw wafer cutting revolution in 2015 and laid a solid foundation for
mono-Si products expansion and
4) making long-term capacity expansion plan to increase economic of scales
LONGi started formulating its rolling 3-year capacity expansion plan since 2018 and
we expect LONGis ambitious capacity expansion target will help the Company
enhance it costs leadership through economic of scales as well as setting higher entry
barriers for any new entrants to the industry
Backed by successful costs improvement measures we observed two significant costs
reduction phase from LONGis mono-Si wafer non-silicon costs movement The first phase
was in 2014-2016 when LONGi introduced DWS cutting for mono-Si wafer which
substantially increased wafer production efficiency We estimate non-silicon production
costs were reduced by 389% from RMB315piece in 2014 to RMB192piece in 2016 We
expect the second phase accelerating costs reduction is still ongoing from 2017 to 2021E
as LONGi announced to make aggressive capacity expansion The economies of scale for
capacity expansion has started to appear as we estimate LONGis non-silicon wafer
manufacturing cost in 2018 declined by 312% YoY to RMB116piece and we expect the
non-silicon costs will continues to fall to RMB101096094 per piece wafer in 2019-21E
respectively
Costs leadership had helped LONGi obtain superior profitability According to peers
benchmark with ZHS and GCL Poly LONGi had significantly higher gross profit margin
even during demand shock caused by NEAs 531 policy brake Given rapid declining
Poly-Si price in 2019 we expect LONGis mono-Si wafer gross profit margin to resume
280% in 2019 and decline slightly in 2020-21E due to further wafer ASP decline

LONGis mono-Si module business was developed through acquisition of Zhejiang Leye
PV Science  Technology Co Ltd in 2014 Different from mono-Si wafers costs leadership
strategy we believe LONGis module business development focuses on product
photovoltaic transmission efficiency side Given supports from low costs in-house
manufactured wafer LONGi Leye module exhibited rapid costs reduction in 2015-17 as
we estimate non-wafer production costs declined by 369% from RMB176watt in 2015 to
RMB111watt in 2017 We estimate non-wafer costs to have slight increase in 2018 as
LONGi adopts more mono-Si PERC cells for high-efficiency modules As market is in favor
of high-efficiency solar modules with considerable pricing premium however we believe
the slight increase in non-wafer costs was justified LONGis mono-Si module sales also
exhibited superior profitability as the Companys module sales recorded higher than peers
gross profit margins during the past few years Looking forward we expect LONGis solar
module gross profit margin to relatively be stable

mono-Si module
Source Company data CMBIS estimates
Figure 24 LONGis gross profit margin for mono-Si
Source Company data CMBIS estimates
Second mover advantages and expanding at good timing
characteristic of PV module development we believe second mover will be in a better
LONGis CAPEX cycle started in 2015 and accelerated from 2017 As a second mover of
the solar industry bring in revolutionary DWS wafer cutting technology we believe LONGi
has substantially less borrowings and historical investment burden allowing the Company
to seize a favorable position at time entering into solar farm grid-parity era Moreover
rapidly developing PERC cells technology further expands market demand for LONGis
improvement which we see vital to further reduce solar farm investment costs
In the upstream material end Poly-Si is the most important raw material for LONGis mono-
Si rod and wafer production LONGis Poly-Si sourcing used to rely on import with relatively
high pricing fluctuation due to trade dispute Thanks to domestic Poly-Si manufacturers
aggressive expansion aiming at import substitution Poly-Si price exhibited significant
decline during the past two years and LONGi also secured its Poly-Si supply through
signing long-term procurement contracts with leading Poly-Si suppliers As we expect there
will be massive new Poly-Si capacity to release in 2019-20E we believe Poly-Si price will
likely to decline and stay low with reasonable GPM at 20-30% representing pricing at a
range of RMB70-80kg for mono grade Poly-Si As such we expect LONGi will have stable
upstream material costs structure in 2019-21E

PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
In the mono-Si product sales perspective as we believe current solar farm development is
getting very close to mass grid-parity in majority areas in the world we expect solar module
price will tend to stabilize We do expect solar module ASP to decline further in the future
but we dont expect product pricing to have significant shuffle as past few years As such
we believe LONGi will be able to enjoy good returns from capacity growth with relatively
stable ASP and GPM and that will increase LONGis earnings visibility

recognition in China through its technological focus on mono-Si products excellent costs
control as well as prudent financial management Management maintained low gearing as
major financial management strategy and mainly used equity financing as funding source
to support LONGis massive CAPEX plan As such LONGi is able to maintain its low
indebtedness level leading ahead of solar peers Listing in the A-share market LONGi is
able to reach continuous equity financing as A-Stock investors are willing to pay for long-
term future Therefore standing at the gate of grid-parity era we believe LONGi has

We forecast revenue CAGR of 434% in 2019-21E
LONGis sales growth was impressive in 2013-18 with a revenue CAGR of 573% On the
back of mono-Si wafer and module sales volume growth driven by strong market demand
and capacity expansion the Company recorded revenue growth of 646% in 1Q19 Given
high solar module order visibility from overseas market we expect LONGis strong sales
growth trend to continue in 2Q and 3Q19 Based on NEAs recent development rules for
solar farm projects in 2019 we expect solar module demand in China to concentrate in
2H19 and we expect that will likely support LONGis wafer and module sales as well as
product ASP
We forecast LONGis revenue to increase by 356%480%389% YoY in 2019E-21E
respectively mainly driven by 664% module sales CAGR and 111% wafer revenue CAGR
during the period We expect mono-modules revenue contribution will increase as new
capacity release output and module sales mix will change from 595% in 2018 to
517%637%697% in 2019E-21E Mono-wafers revenue contribution will boost up in
2019E due to faster capacity expansion pace than mono-module We estimate mono-wafer
sales revenue contribution mix to increase from 278% in 2018 to 387% in 2019E then
decline to 282%232% in 2020-21E

LONGis overall gross profit margin follow a similar track as the Company achieved
technology breakthrough with DWS wafer cutting and gaining economies of scale through
capacity expansion Gross profit margin increased from 123% in 2013 to multi-year high
at 323% in 2017 then suffered a sharp decline to 222% in 2018 due to Chinese
Governments 531 policy brake which caused solar price to tumble in 2H18 Looking
forward based on 1) stable upstream Poly-Si price outlook 2) wafer and module ASP
decline in a mild pace and 3) LONGis continuous costs reduction measures we forecast
LONGis mono-module gross profit margin to be resilient at 222%212%211% in 2019-
21E respectively while mono-wafer gross profit margin to rebound to 280% in 2019E then
decline gradually to 260%230% in 2020E21E We expect gross margin decline to be
driven by ASP decline slightly faster than production cost reduction We expect LONGis
overall gross profit margin to also stay resilient at 249%228%215% in 2019-21E
respectively

2019-21E net profit CARG to reach 255%
LONGis net profit CAGR during 2013-2018 was outstanding among solar manufacturing
peers at a stunning figure of 1048% Net profit surged from RMB709mn in 2013 to
RMB2558mn in 2018 LONGi reported 1Q19 net profit of RMB611mn with YoY earnings
growth of 125% slower than revenue growth as 1Q19 had a substantially different market
material costs and product ASP outlook 2) resilient gross profit margin projection and 3)
significant sales volume growth boost by capacity growth and thrilling increasing mono-Si

Healthy balance sheet supports future capacity expansion
LONGi has prudent financial management on balance sheet The Company has
maintained net cash position for years and turned net gearing to 02% in 2018 as with
massive capacity investments Management adopts 60% liabilities to assets ratio as the
major controlling measures for indebtedness level and LONGi adopts equity financing
through rights issue and placement as major funding source for CAPEX Given LONGis
low borrowing level we believe the Company also has plenty room to gear up through debt
financing to support future CAPEX needs and that may help LONGi to balance the
concerns for EPS dilution and gearing control
LONGi exhibited an inventory turnover days jump from 592 days in 2017 to 711 in 2018
receivable and payable turnover days also experienced a hike in 2018 as the Company
expanded its capacity and sales Management explained inventory building in 2018 was
mainly due to changing geographic sales structure since LONGi shifted module sales
focus from domestic market to overseas and it took longer time for overseas sales with
longer shipping and warehouse storage cycle We believe LONGi is still in its learning
phase for overseas inventory management and we project inventory turnover days to
increase further to 786 days in 2019E and then improve to 713 and 720 days in 202021E
respectively

Historically LONGi traded with a 1-year forward PER range between 76x and 684x during
the pasted five years with a 5-year average PER of 174x LONGis valuation was traded
up to 1 standard deviation to 248x during Jul 2017 to May 2018 as the Company gained
significant cost advantages and expanding mono-Si market shares Valuation tumbled after
NEAs 531 policy brake in Jun 2018 then resumed quickly as market perceived LONGis
resilient earnings performance
Initiate BUY with TP of RMB280 per share
We initiate with BUY rating on LONGi with a TP of RMB280 per share based on 23x
2019E PER Our target multiple is derived based LONGis historical up cycle as well as
285% valuation premium over sector peers average valuation On the back of solar farm
demand to resume and concentrate in 2H19 we expect mono-Si demand and ASP to be
solid and that will likely intensify market sentiment towards the solar manufacturing sector
Moreover given LONGis leading product costs structure as well as capability to expand
capacity output to meet grid-parity demand with sound financing supports we expect
LONGi to further enhance its leading position ahead of peers As such we believe LONGi
deserves a valuation premium and our valuation target is justified

Substitutional PV technology breakthrough
LONGi placed PV technology focus on mono-silicon and made heavy investments in
wafer cells and all the way towards high efficient mono-modules The Company had
established technology leadership through high efficient mono-PV cell over traditional
multicrystalline products As technology would never stop evolving however we believe
LONGi will face risks from substitutional technologies such as 1) cast-mono wafer 2)
larger size wafer without chamfer 3) PV cell focus shift from PERC technology to HIT PV
Cell technologies and 4) perovskite solar cell Any technology breakthrough through those
technologies will significantly increase substitutional risks to LONGis mono-wafer and
module products
Policy risks in China and overseas markets
We still see policy uncertainty a key market risk in China for LONGi albeit market demand
in the country was eventually released from a freeze due to 531 policy brake Weve
noticed that NEA took unusually long time to finalize PV project development rules in China
for 2019 indicating difficulties to balance needs from different stakeholders Going forward
NEA China to establish a more sophisticated system to promote and govern renewable
energy applications We believe the processes will be bumpy and that will likely bring
uncertainties to LONGis business in near term
LONGi has increasing business exposures in the overseas market as the Company
expands its mono-product capacity and shipments We believe LONGi has mature
experience in handling trade dispute such as setting overseas production facilities in
Malaysia to avoid additional tariff However given LONGis increasing overseas sales
exposure with major production facilities in China we believe LONGi could still suffer from
potential trade dispute in short term
LONGi turned product sales focus to overseas market after 531 policy brake According
to management overseas market sales accounted for more than 70% of total revenue in
4M19 and overseas sales were mainly settled with US RMB appreciation would be
unfavorable to LONGis profit margin as major production costs are settled in RMB
