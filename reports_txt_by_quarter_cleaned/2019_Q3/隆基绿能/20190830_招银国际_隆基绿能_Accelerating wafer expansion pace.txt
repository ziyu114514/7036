UpDownside
LONGis robust earnings performance was well expected by the market but we
still discover several highlights including 1) non-silicon wafer costs reduction
reached 3175% 2) module GPM reached 284% and 3) accelerating capacity
expansion pace We are impressed by LONGis cost control capability and we
believe the Company now has enhanced product pricing power We roll over
valuation to FY20E with multiple of 215x Raise TP to RMB3237 maintain BUY
 1H19 earnings surged 538% Revenue increased 411% YoY to
RMB14111mn driven by wafermodule external shipment growth of
1834%210% YoY Major operating expense remained in good control and
on track with our full year estimates Net profit read RMB2010mn up 538%
YoY Based on 1H19 results we estimate 2Q19 net profit was RMB1398mn
up 1287% QoQ indicating significant increase in product profitability
 1H19 wafer non-silicon cost reduction reached 3175% The cost reduction
pace was significantly faster than our expectation At current poly-Si and wafer
prices we estimate LONGis wafer sales GPM is likely to reach above 30%
which would be significantly higher than 1H19 wafer sales GPM of 232%
Other than margin expansion mgmt also disclosed that the Company has
been running tight in wafer supply Therefore LONGi intenses to accelerate
its wafer expansion pace by 1 year earlier setting new target to have 65GW
wafer capacity by end-2020
 Module shipment reached 319GW with a GPM of 284% Module GPM
further expanded 46ppt YoY despite the fact that 1H18 module product
pricing was substantially better reflecting LONGis capability in cost control
For FY19 LONGi maintains 95GW module output target of which 1-15GW
for internal use leaving 8-85GW for external sales Given LONGis excellent
cost reduction we expect module sales to maintain stable GPM in 2H19
with peers we believe LONGi now has enhanced pricing power over peers
especially to those multi-Si wafer producers
 Raise TP to RMB3237 maintain BUY Based on revised costs and product
price outlook and CB conversion impact we trim FY19-21E EPS forecast by
331632% to RMB125151193 LONGi had approached our previous TP
of RMB2800 We roll over our PE valuation to FY20E earnings based on a
multiple of 215x Given FY19-21E earnings CAGR of 290% we believe our
multiple selection is justified Lift TP by 156% to RMB3237 per share
Maintain BUY
