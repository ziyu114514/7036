SUMMARY LONGi released positive profit alert stating 1H19 earnings would
surge by 50-60% YoY on the back of 1) rapid wafer and module sales growth and
2) improving product costs We believe 1H19 earnings beat consensus estimates
and 2H19 module sales will likely accelerate with PV demand release in China
 2Q19 earnings more than doubled QoQ LONGis profit alert stated that
1H19 earnings surged 50-60% YoY to RMB1961mn-2091mn implying 2Q19
earnings would be RMB1350mn-1480mn more than double of 1Q19
earnings of RMB611mn We believe the yet to release 1H19 results will beat
consensus estimates as 1) 1H19 earnings would account for half of
consensus earnings of RMB4077mn while we see 2H19 module shipment to
accelerate with HoH growth of 497% and 2) GPM from wafer and module
sales seems better than our estimates
 Strong 1H19 shipment 2H19 module sales likely to aim higher Wafer
and module shipment recorded 2151mn piece and 32GW representing YoY
growth of 1838% and 214% respectively LONGis wafer and module
shipment hit 515% and 401% run rate versus our FY19 estimates (4177mn
piece wafer and 80GW module sales) We are still optimistic about LONGis
mono-product sales in 2H19 as 1) mgmt disclosed LONGi has already
secured 70% module orders for 3Q19 and 2) we expect more than 25GW PV
installation demand in China to release in 2H19 with NEAs recent project
bidding results We believe LONGis sales target will be easily fulfilled
 Secure long-term wafer sales contract Prior to the positive profit alert
LONGi announced to reach long-term wafer sales contract for 1310mn pieces
in 2019-21 with Ningbo Yize (宁波江北宜则新能源)  Based on current wafer
spot market price the contract worth US540mn and we estimate the
contract wafer shipment represents 6%10%9% of LONGis wafer external
sales volume in 2019-21E
 Raise FY19E earnings up by 59% Based on revised GPM outlook for
LONGis better-than-expected wafer and module production costs control we
raise FY19-21E EPS outlook by 59%73%118% to RMB130153199
respectively We believe LONGis 1H19 performance will enhance its leading
position in PV product supply chain Reiterate BUY with TP unchanged at
RMB2800 per share
