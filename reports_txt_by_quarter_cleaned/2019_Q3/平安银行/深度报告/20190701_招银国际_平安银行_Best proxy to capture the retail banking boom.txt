since kicking off its full-scale retail transformation in 2016 We expect the Bank
to deliver all-round improvement in financial performance going forward Initiate
coverage with BUY
 Huge growth potential with client base expansion and upgrade
product spectrum and extensive distribution network Ping An Bank (PAB)
was able to achieve a rapid growth of retail client base (44% CAGR in 2016-
18) The Banks strategic focus has now shifted to growing high-net-worth
individuals that offer greater business potential due to broader financial
demand and higher stickiness A key initiative is to incorporate Ping An
Trusts wealth management team into the Banks private banking (PB)
 Resilient margin amid interest liberalization China banks would continue
to face margin pressure as PBoC gradually liberalizes interest rates Banks
with higher retail loan exposure should enjoy stronger pricing power and
superior NIM trend As of 2018 PABs proportion of retail loans was 58%
highest in the sector In contrary to most peers whose retail loans are
primarily mortgage PAB owns a balanced retail loan portfolio (incl mortgage
credit cards personal business loans and other consumption loans)
offering itself more bargaining power and flexibility on pricing
 Benign asset quality outlook despite macro uncertainties With a retail-
oriented loan mix PAB is well positioned to enjoy greater risk diversification
and less cyclicality to macro-economy Apart from some fluctuation in NPL
ratio of personal business loans asset quality of other retail loans has
remained solid over time reflecting PABs decent market penetration As of
1Q19 PABs NPL ratio and provision coverage stood at 173% (-2bps QoQ)
and 1706% (154ppts QoQ) We see an early sign of asset quality turning
point With stricter loan classification the Banks NPL formation and credit

Investment Highlights
Huge growth potential with expansion and upgrade of client base
extensive distribution network PAB was able to achieve a rapid growth of retail client
base (44% CAGR in 2016-18) Around 40% of customer acquisition was through the
migration from various channels of PAG during the period As of 1Q19 PABs total no of
retail clients reached 87mn of which 076% and 004% were Wealth clients (RMB
500000 AUM) and PB clients (RMB 6mn AUM) respectively
Since 4Q18 PABs strategic focus has shifted from expanding client base to cultivating
high-net-worth individuals Such kind of clients could offer greater business potential
given their broader financial demand and higher stickiness In Oct 2018 the Bank
announced to incorporate Ping An Trusts wealth management team into its PB division
the proportion of Wealth and PB clients as of total retail clients started to pick up in 2H18

More resilient margin amid interest liberalization
As the PBoC gradually pushes for interest rate liberalization in China banks NIM would
banks with higher retail loan exposure would enjoy stronger pricing power therefore
outperform during the interest liberalization cycle
China started monetary easing with a series of cuts in benchmark interest rate in late-
2014 and the NIM of PAB and CMB (two most typical retail banks in China) has been
outrunning sector average since 2015 As of 2018 PAB had the highest proportion of
retail loans of 58% followed by 54% for PSBC and 51% for CMB
We do not see any advantage in corporate banking for PAB vs sector peers but its retail
business generates notably higher loan yields In contrary to most large banks whose
retail loans are mainly allocated to mortgage PAB has been consistently exploring credit
cards car loans and personal business loans and owns a more balanced retail loan
portfolio Non-mortgage retail loans offer banks more bargaining power and flexibility on
pricing resulting in more resilient loan yields and NIM

Benign asset quality trend despite rising macro uncertainties
Similar to peers PABs corporate NPL ratio (259%) is significantly higher than retail NPL
ratio (110%) as of 1Q19 and corporate NPLs contributed to majority (63%) of the Banks
total NPLs That said the Bank has notably reduced the proportion of risky corporate
in 2018 from 217% in 2016 More importantly with the highest proportion of retail loans
(58%) PAB is well positioned to enjoy greater risk diversification and less cyclicality to
macro-economy
Looking into the breakdown of retail loans apart from a volatile NPL ratio of personal
business loans asset quality of other retail loans has remained quite solid over time
reflecting PABs decent penetration into retail market
As of 1Q19 PABs NPL ratio and provision coverage stood at 173% and 1706% down
2bps QoQ and up 154ppts QoQ respectively We see an early sign of asset quality
turning point With more stringent NPL recognition practice the Banks NPL formation

Expect 12-15% YoY net profit growth in FY19-21E
We forecast a 136% CAGR for PABs revenue in FY19-21E mainly driven by healthy
on strong bank card and agency service fees Wealth management fee is likely to record
positive growth in FY19 after a consecutive decline in FY17-18 as the Bank finished
transformation of the business in accordance to the new asset management rule
Given PABs relatively high credit costs and strengthened provision buffer in 1Q19 we
see great earnings resilience should asset quality continue to improve We expect net
profit to grow by 122%134%153% in FY192021 up from 70% in FY18 As a result
ROE is estimated to bottom out in FY19 and stay in the uptrend in FY20-21

Our revenue and net profit forecasts are 2-4% higher than Bloomberg consensus in
FY19-20 and our ROE forecasts are 04ppt above consensus for the same period This
is mainly due to our more bullish view on PABs NIM and credit cost trend as we believe
the Banks successful retail transformation will lead to notable improvement in financial

Risks related to macroeconomy
Chinas economic growth has been slowing down in recent years and government is
actively pushing for deleveraging and industrial upgrade In addition the China-US trade
tension is adding pressure on the countrys economic outlook Although we believe the
slowdown remains largely controllable as countermeasures are rolled out an unexpected
macro hard-landing may cause the asset quality of banks to deteriorate The weakened
business activities and employment may dampen the repayment capability of both
corporate and retail customers of the Bank consequently leading to a surge in NPLs
Risks related to monetary policy
China banks profitability is closely related to central banks monetary policies PBoC has
been liberalizing its interest rates and this has significant impact on both asset and
offering will have stronger bargaining power on lending rates On the other hand banks
squeeze margins Looking ahead we expect China to maintain a relatively
Therefore liquidity condition should stay relatively eased This to some extent would
help to mitigate the margin pressure for banks heavily relying on interbank borrowings
However should the central bank tighten the monetary policy or loosen the guidance on
Risks related to credit card and consumption loans
Credit cards and consumption loans with smaller amounts and better risk diversification
generate higher yields (vs mortgages) and lower NPL ratios (vs personal business loans)
Therefore they are preferred assets for banks to increase retail banking exposure
especially amid Chinas consumption upgrade However individual customers may also
borrow from the fast-expanding consumer finance providers and online lending platforms
As the credit records in these channels may not be available for banks to obtain
customers debt level may be underestimated and their default risks may increase
especially during economic downturn and rising unemployment rate The soaring debt
ratio of individuals and spill-over effect of defaults may result in higher NPLs of banks
retail loans
Risks related to regulatory environment
Chinese authorities have been tightening the regulation on banks business activities and
operating indicators For example CBIRC is considering to implement a stricter NPL
recognition standard After banks had included 90 day overdue loans into NPLs by the
end of 2018 the regulator was guiding large banks to further include 60 day overdue
loans into NPLs PAB improved its NPL  90 day overdue loans ratio to 103% in 2018
from 52% in 2015 This partly resulted in relatively high NPL formation and credit costs
during the period If the stricter NPL recognition is imposed sector wide PAB may face
further pickup in NPL ratio and pressure on impairment charges

China banks are facing multiple challenges including economic restructuring regulatory
deteriorating profitability for corporate banking business As such Retail business
broadening of customer reach PAB stays in the forefront of retail business development
and Fintech utilization in our view However other banks may catch up with innovative

could also divert the Banks customer resources
