SUMMARY On 7 Aug PAB reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 154bn up 152%
YoY and accounting for 557% of consensus full-year estimate 2Q19 PPoP
trading gains Despite prudent provision charge (232% YoY) in 2Q19 earning
growth accelerated to 174% YoY which is likely the highest among nationwide
banks As a result 1H19 annualized ROE recovered 06ppt YoY to 136% We
expect sustainable above-peers earning growth (12-15% in FY19-21E) for PAB
on the back of resilient NIM and improving asset quality Reiterate BUY
 Results positive 1) NIM widened by 18bp QoQ to 271% thanks to higher
retail loan yield (38bp QoQ) and lower cost of funding esp interbank
borrowing PAB further lifted retail loan proportion to 588% as of 2Q19 on
faster growth of credit card overdrafts (38% QoQ) vs total loan growth (15%
QoQ) 2) NPL ratio was down 5bp QoQ to 168% with 14% QoQ
decrease in NPL balance NPL formation also retreated to the lowest level of
13% in the past five quarters We believe PABs NPL ratio could continue to
decline in 2H19 as both SML and overdue loan ratio (leading indicators for
asset quality) dropped 3) NPL recognition was more stringent as NPL 
90-day overdue loans rose to 113% in 2Q19 from 104 in 1Q19 4)
Provision coverage climbed 12ppt QoQ to four-year high of 183% despite
lower credit cost 5) CAR improved 112bps QoQ to 126% after the Bank
issued RMB 30bn tier-2 capital bond in Apr Capital position would be further
strengthened after the conversion of RMB 26bn CB 6) Steady growth in
retail client base (37% QoQ) and retail AUM (55% QoQ) and continued
migration to wealth and PB clients
weaker fees from investment banking and asset custody businesses
notwithstanding robust growth in settlement and agency fees
 Maintain BUY and RMB 170 TP We expect positive share price reaction
after the strong set of results PAB currently trades at 095x FY19E PB We
keep earning forecast unchanged and our RMB 170 TP is based on a
GGM-derived target PB of 12x and FY19E BVPS of RMB 142
