Polyurethane market leader expanding into petrochemicals and specialty chemicalsnew materials
MDITDI below historical averages pending further volume growth potential
Petrochemical plants help remove limitation in feedstock
Specialty chemical capability still needs time to take off
Financials and valuation
万华化学 (600309SS)
We initiate on Wanhua Chemical with a Neutral rating
fundamental (balance sheet and cash flow) and cyclical product exposure (MDI TDI and
petrochemical demand are mostly GDP linked)
Product exposure remains favorable
We note Wanhuas favorable exposure to MDI and TDI with both having a high
industry concentration and fewer than 10 players globally are capable of producing MDI
Leading players (including Wanhua) are expanding capacity which further increases
industry concentration The underlying end-markets are generally growing slightly faster
than global GDP (despite short-term volatility) We believe Wanhua is well-prepared to
capture most of the MDI demand growth potential from China
Plant optimization adding more value
We like Wanhuas focus on cost and production optimization which put it at the low
end of the global cost curve not only in MDI but also in polyol propylene derivatives and
ethylene derivatives We believe Wanhuas focus on people and RD facilitates the
optimization process incentivizing innovation and technological breakthroughs Wanhua
aims to achieve plant and product synergy and risk diversification in every new
investment
Where are we different from the market
entering the MDI market at least over the next three to four years We believe it will be
suppliers which 1) have been in the market for decades 2)  have existing expansion
plans and 3) are getting ready to capture most of the demand growth potential at
than greenfield projects)
We are more concerned about Wanhuas near-term earnings Year-to-date MDI and
TDI prices have fallen significantly in both yoy and hoh terms Our 2019E earnings
estimates are c15% below Bloomberg consensus We believe consensus is still pricing
We agree that the margin and return profile of new petrochemical specialty chemical
and new material businesses are likely dilutive to Wanhuas existing high-margin
polyurethane product exposure (ie not as strong cost advantage) However we think
the more diversified that Wanhuas business is the lower the normalized return would
likely be  though it could deserve a higher multiple (due to a less-cyclical asset
portfolio)

Valuations
We apply 70X EVEBITDA on the 2020-2021 blended average EBITDA (vs an EBITDA
CAGR of 13%) to derive a 12-month target price of Rmb470 The target multiple is
slightly below its long-term historical average of 83X since listing to factor in the
near-term weak MDITDI margin

Polyurethane market leader expanding into petrochemicals and
specialty chemicalsnew materials
Wanhua Chemical was established in 1998 and listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange
in 2001 started off as a synthetic leather factory in 1978 later building its own
polyurethane for 30 years It is now the worlds largest producer of MDI The
Since then it has accelerated the diversification of its operations Wanhua now has
three core business segments polyurethane petrochemicals and specialty chemicals 
new materials
Key driver 1 - Polyurethane (76% of gross profit 51% of revenue as of FY2018)
Product details Polyurethane is the bread and butter of Wanhua Chemical The main
products under this category include MDI and TDI Methylenediphenyl diisocyanate
(MDI) a key raw material of polyurethane can be mixed with polyol to produce rigid
polyurethane foam widely used in refrigerators coatings materials and thermal
insulation of buildings Toluene diisocyanate (TDI) can be mixed with polyol to produce
bedding etc
2018) Wanhuas MDI capacity increased from 10kt in 1995 to 100kt in 2002 and to
1800kt now Global leading MDI and TDI players include BASF Covestro and
Huntsman Both products have a high industry concentration and most of the
technology used is self-invented without much external licensing Product prices vary
across different regions depending on the local supply-demand dynamics
Key driver 2 - Petrochemical (9% of gross profit 31% of revenue)
Product details Wanhua is exposed to the C3 propylene value chain after building its
POAE plant (propylene oxide and acrylate ester) in 2015 It now plans to enter the C2

ethylene value chain by building its own ethylene cracker which it is targeting to
that to value-added ethylene and propylene derivatives These derivatives are mostly
global market with many suppliers There are a wide range of downstream applications
including plastics polyester fibers etc
suppliers are still the major refiners (Sinopec and PetroChina) There is increasing
supply from CTOMTO (coal to olefinmethanol to olefin) PDH (propane
dehydrogenation) and ethane crackers These units help diversify the feedstock from oil
to coalmethanolLPGethane Globally we see increasing new supply from the US
(taking advantages of the cheap US ethane supply) and the Middle East (using the
cheap oilnaphtha supply)

MDITDI below historical averages pending further volume growth
MDITDI prices are both below their historical ranges
Pure MDI prices fell 33% in 2018 from Rmb30000ton to Rmb20000ton mainly due to
weak demand This weakness in MDI prices persisted for about four months before
rebounding in March 2019 which we attribute to anticipation of US-China trade tensions
being resolved and potential policy loosening in China However the rebound in prices
has proven to be temporary with MDI prices declining from the peak level of
Rmb25000ton in April to Rmb17000ton in July Current prices for pure and poly MDI
are now 34%43% above the bottom prices of Rmb14600ton and Rmb9100ton in
4Q2015 but 10%27% below the historical average (since 2006)
China TDI prices fell 60% in 2018 from Rmb40000ton to Rmb16000ton The TDI
TDI capacity (300ktpa) at end-2018 adding 36% to China capacity The current TDI
price is about 21% above the bottom price of Rmb11300ton but 35% below the
historical average (since 2013)
mainly driven by its own products demand supply instead of cost-based The high
industry concentration of the industry allows the producers to manage the pricing
according to their own production schedule to meet the demand According to Wanhua
they can run at low plant utilization or go for maintenance if they see the near term
demand is disappointing in order to hold the ASP The fluctuation in the main feedstock
such as benzene or toluene are not affecting the MDI prices as much

Global largest MDI suppliers continue to expand their capacity Wanhua (the top
supplier) is expanding its China Yantai and Ningbo units from 6001200ktpa to
11001500ktpa respectively in the next two years (adding in total 800ktpa equivalent
to a 25% increase to China capacity) They are also planning to build their first MDI unit
(400ktpa) in the United States (Louisiana) BASF (the second large supplier) is adding
250ktpa capacity in Geismar in the US Covestro (the third large supplier) is adding
200ktpa capacity in Germany 100kpta capacity in China and planning 300ktpa capacity
in Baytown in the US All three players are well-prepared to capture future demand
growth in Asia Europe and the US
New China domestic supplier announces capacity addition plans In addition to the
global MDI suppliers we see new Chinese players interested in entering the MDI market
- Fujian Connell (400ktpa Wanhua recently announced the acquisition but not yet
of success to this highly concentrated market We think it is safe to assume that these
new suppliers are not likely to cause any material implications to the MDI supply in
with high chance of project delay as it is their first time accessing (could easily take
6months for ramp up)

Demand tracker showing weaker year-to-date data points (particularly for autos)
Utilization near term hampered by the weak demand data points
Based on our recent channel checks with industry consultants and corporates the MDI
and TDI plants in general are not running at high utilization at the moment (just roughly
70%) There are a couple of scheduled maintenance periods in the summer season
Despite the low plants utilization and maintenance MDI and TDI prices are still trending
The latest end-application demand data are not showing recovery signal yet In
particular the monthly auto productionsales data (one core demand driver for MDITDI)
is still trending weak We have not yet seen material policy loosening (property or
infrastructure spending) In the weak demand environment with low plants utilization
new TDI capacity addition (Wanhuas plant in end-2018) has caused TDI exports to
grow materially
Impact on demand from US China trade tension
MDI is a highly GDP-driven chemical product The extended trade tension between
China and the US causes concerns around a macroeconomic slowdown We expect the
prolonged trade issue could have a negative impact on the MDI business particularly in
poly MDI given c32% of Chinas 2018 exports went to the US Based on monthly data
for the industry we saw a sharp decline in Chinas poly MDI exports to the US in May
2019 According to Wanhuas management they are able to redirect the trade flow
internally and use their MDI units in Hungary to supply poly MDI to existing customers

Production flow optimization Wanhua has spent 10 years optimizing the production
production facilities have been revamped more than 10 times to achieve the lowest cost
possible and be environmentally friendly (eg emission controlrecycling) We estimated
the total cost savings from plant integration and optimization could amount to
Rmb2500ton after considering their internal supply of hydrogen aniline and energy a
better recycling of resources (eg HCL) and better fixed cost sharing (lower per unit cost
due to higher sales volume)
Competitive return vs global peers Wanhua is one of the lowest-cost producers
globally We expect Wanhua to remain the top MDI supplier and start to gain market
players only Covestro and BASF are still actively expanding MDI further in other
countries to capture domestic demand growth However we note that Covestro and
BASF have exposure to many other chemical products while most of Wanhuas
chemical products exposure and high concentration industries we found limited industry
disclosure by the leading polyurethane suppliers globally There are no clear pure-play

Wanhuas new growth potential - volume the first step
Expansion plan capturing most demand growth potential in China Wanhua is planning a
25% increase in China MDI supply by expanding its Yantai and Ningbo MDI at very
Only Covestros plant and some new domestic Chinese players are expanding
capacity in China We do not see them as a big threat to Wanhua
Seeking overseas market growth Wanhua is expanding its presence in the overseas
market (5-year revenue CAGR was 36% in 2013-2018) Its new MDI plant in the US is
one of the ways Wanhua is deploying capital and diversifying its regional exposure
(might delay due to recent trade tension) However we also note that the gross profit
margin of the overseas business is generally lower than what Wanhua can achieve
domestically (partly due to transportation cost and penetration)
MDI price spread to remain stable with slight downside risk in 20202021 More than half
maintain the price (not high enough to be demand destroying and low enough to be
negative to share prices) For the rest of the supply addition the global demand (we
forecast about 5% on average) is enough to offset the global supply growth leading to
our forecasts of stable MDI pricing outlook in 20202021 back to about historical
average MDI pricing
construction progress for its new Yantai ethylene plant Assuming the plant is
petrochemical segment sales further It could also benefit the specialty chemical and
new material business as ethylene is one of the key building blocks (at least for the
production of polyol)
图表 30 Volume matters more than margins for Wanhua
万华化学 (600309SS)
Petrochemical plants help remove limitation in feedstock
Integrated C3 propylene value chain In 2001 Wanhua started planning the construction
of a POAE plant (propylene oxideacrylate ester) and put the plant into operation in
August 2015 The unit converts LPG (imported from the Middle East) into propylene
derivatives including propylene oxide (PO) acrylic acid (AA) and acrylate ester (AE)
Wanhua has the largest China PDH capacity per unit (propane dehydrogenation) of
750ktpa and the third-largest China AA capacity of 300ktpa The fully integrated
propylene value chain enables Wanhua to earn a more stable price spread and profit
margin (regardless of price changes for intermediate chemicals)
Unique LPG feedstock cost advantage Wanhua has a 24mn m3 underground LPG
storage capacity (expanded from 12mn m3) that helps it manages the high seasonality
of LPG prices throughout the year Due to the large volume of LPG it imports Wanhua
starting in February 2016 Wanhua has also recently signed an agreement with Abu
Dhabi on a 10-year LPG supply contract for the purchase of up to 1mn tonnes of LPG

Value-added plant integration
Petrochemical plants are set to resolve the feedstock constraint Wanhuas existing
POAE unit helps supply propylene oxide the core feedstock of polyol (to be mixed with
MDITDI to produce foams) The new ethylene unit helps supply ethylene oxide (EO)
another core feedstock to polyol Both feedstocks are flammable and explosive and
hence are difficult to transport Plant integration can help resolve the feedstock issue
and reduce transportation and handling fees The new ethylene plant can also utilize the
hydrochloric acid (HCL) produced from Wanhuas Yantai polyurethane plant and
convert it into value-added PVC for sale (previously Wanhua has had to pay a cost to
handle the acidic HCL)
petrochemical units could provide valuable ethylenepropylene derivatives as feedstock
and propylene derivatives are important building blocks for a number of specialty
chemicals (eg ethylene copolymer or high purified ethylene oxide)
Wide range of applications with high import dependence
Import-dependent ethylene and propylene derivatives China still requires a lot of
ethylene and propylene derivatives Multiple products along the value chains are still
highly dependent on overseas suppliers (eg PE polyethylene 48% ethylene glycol
58% as of 2018) The low chemical products self-sufficiency rate was partly because
much of these products have traditionally originated from refining (was slowly developed
given the domination of Chinese oil majors and the generally oversupplied refining
industry)
Diversifying production methods The existing ethylene and propylene derivatives supply
is still dominated by the traditional oil majors with naphtha and oil as the feedstock The
other chemical production methods (such as CTOMTO PDH and ethane cracker) has
developed and the increase availability of the feedstock supply eg ethane supply from

Wide range of applications that are still growing There are a wide range of
end-applications including consumer plastics coating materials and adhesives Most of
Chinas ethylene and propylene derivatives demand could grow at a rate higher than
that of China GDP growth The high rates of urbanization and the consumption upgrades
are incentivizing more of this consumption growth According to the recent plastic report
and global plastic demand model we expect global virgin plastics demand to grow 32%
over next decade in our base case

Specialty chemical capability still needs time to take off
Steadily growing specialty chemical and new materials Wanhua has separately
disclosed the financial performance of its specialty chemical and new material business
segment starting in 2016 The segment revenue is growing rapidly (2016-2018 CAGR of
44%) but only contributed about 10% of Wanhuas gross profit as of FY2018 The
gross profit margin during 2016-2018 stayed at around 30%-40% slightly lower than that
of polyurethane but much higher than petrochemicals
Multiple chemical branches According to Wanhuas latest reporting the specialty
chemical and new material segment includes surface material TPU SAP PC modified
isocyanate specialty amines etc Wanhua has set up relevant business units
accordingly 1) performance material (eg TPU) 2) performance chemicals (eg HDI
IPDI HMDI IPDA) and 3) surface material (eg coatings and adhesives acrylic
Slow but sustainable high-quality earning growth High-performance functional
to application  penetration Although we note that Wanhua is diversifying its products
we believe it is too early to count on the success of these efforts given that they are in
the early stages of development For instance the new PC and PMMA capacity
additions are good milestones as Wanhua moves to diversify its product offering but
chemicals) with a high degree of specialization and low demand replacement

Financials and valuation
Growth Wanhua has achieved impressive revenue and earnings growth in past
decades thanks to its continuous capacity growth (not only in MDI but also in TDI and
petrochemicals) We expect Wanhua will continue to be the market leader in
polyurethane and expand MDI capacity at both its Yantai and Ningbo sites based on the
latest expansion in progress We also expect Wanhuas ethane project will be
contributing to earnings in 2021 We forecast Wanhua to achieve a revenue CAGR of
Margin Wanhuas 2019E margin is hit by the year-to-date weak MDI and TDI prices
(partly due the to weak economic environment) We forecast gross profit margin to
recover from 37% in 2019 to 41% in 2020E mainly due to a higher contribution from
high-margin polyurethane and specialty chemical businesses

Gearing We expect Wanhuas net-debt-to-equity will increase to 63% in 2019E to fund
the new ethylene project and the MDI expansions That gearing will decline over time as
the operating cash flow starts to increase
ROE We forecast ROE and ROA to dip in 2019 (weak margins) and rebound in 2020E
and 2021E (TDI MDI and ethylene projects start to contribute to earnings)
Capex We forecast higher capex in 2019-2020E mainly for the Yantai ethylene project
We expect capex will start to decline in 2021E
Dividend We expect the heavy capex cycle and weak 2019E margin will not be
supportive of a high dividend payout We forecast Wanhuas dividend payout to be
maintained at 52% in 2019E-2021E

Our 12-month target price of Rmb470 is based on 70X forward EVEBITDA (applied to
a simple average of 2020E21E EBITDA) discounted back using a discount rate of 10%
(our estimate of Wanhuas weighted average cost of capital) We use EVEBITDA as
our primary valuation methodology as we view EBITDA as a better representation of
consistent with the valuation approach we take both globally and regionally The target

What would make us more positive
1) Street consensus turns more realistic (we are c15% below Bloomberg consensus
estimates for 2019)
2) The shares begin pricing in too much of an economic downturn and we start to expect
goods sales etc)
4) Any supply disruption occurs globally (it happens in 2017 when 2 overseas plants
were shut down for 3-6 months)
万华化学 (600309SS)
The key risks include
Product margins (-) Better-worse-than-expected product margins (particularly MDI
an easy-to-track pricing where Wanhua has the highest exposure) due to its respective
demandsupply dynamics For instance better-than-expected product demand is
This can be due to unscheduled maintenance operational accidents bad weather or
feedstock shortages A high portion of the MDI facilities are more than 20 years old
implying a higher chance of supply disruption We see this as a temporary upside risk to
prices spreads and margins
Project delays (-) Our estimates for Wanhua Chemical assume specific
lower-than-expected earnings There are multiple reasons that could result in project
delays (eg engineeringconstruction delay failure in trial production run etc)
Feedstock cost volatility (-) While Wanhua is already benefiting from its highly
change in feedstock cost (eg LPG and benzene)
Operational risks (-) The chemical industry is a high-risk business that involves a lot of
toxic and explosive materials There are occasional accidentsexplosions globally that
RD success (-) RD is a very important element behind the growth of the
polyurethane and specialty chemical business It is a time-consuming and expensive
process that is difficult to time the success of We believe any breakthrough will create
step changes to our expectation to future earnings

Across our global coverage we examine stocks using an MA framework considering
both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and
acquisition target 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low
rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target and
may or may not be discussed in research
Under our MA framework for the Asia Pacific Energy and Chemical sector we
recognize a myriad of factors could influence the probability of a deal and our regional
Regulation on ownership that prohibits or discourages acquisitions including by a
foreign entity on grounds of national security
realization of planned synergy and restructuring upside
Management stance in terms of its openness to a deal (eg being the target of an
acquisition or management buyout) especially by government appointees

Industry attractiveness based on a growing profit pool as a function of asset
expansion revenue growth or profitability improvement
Within this context we have ranked Wanhua Chemical a 3 and weight our MA
value by 0% (reflecting the probability implied by this ranking) within our target price

投资摘要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与其行业和市场相比较来评价该股的投资环境。所描述的四个主要指标包括增长、回报、估值倍数和波动性。增
长、回报和估值倍数都是运用数种方法综合计算而成，以确定该股在地区研究行业内所处的百分位排名。
每项指标的准确计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法如下：
增长是下一年预测与当前年度预测的综合比较，如每股盈利、EBITDA 和收入等。 回报是各项资本回报指标一年预测的加总，如CROCI、平均运用资本
回报率和净资产回报率。 估值倍数根据一年预期估值比率综合计算，如市盈率、股息收益率、EVFCF、EVEBITDA、EVDACF、市净率。 波动性根据
12个月的历史波动性计算并经股息调整。
在我们的全球覆盖范围中，我们使用并购框架来分析股票，综合考虑定性和定量因素（各行业和地区可能会有所不同）以计入某些公司被收购的可能性。
然后我们按照从1到3对公司进行并购评分，其中1分代表公司成为并购标的的概率较高(30%-50%)，2分代表概率为中等(15%-30%)，3分代表概率较低
(0%-15%)。对于评分为1或2的公司，我们按照研究部统一标准将并购因素体现在我们的目标价格当中。并购评分为3被认为意义不大，因此不予体现在
