Positive outlook for the lithium battery business
potential regulatory risk for the e-cigarette segment
 We visited EVE Energy last week to discuss with management its business growth
outlook for 20192020
 Management gave positive guidance for its core lithium battery business growth
outlook in 20192020 citing energy storage power battery and IoT applications as
the main drivers of business growth
 Its fast-growing e-cigarette business (50% of total profit in 2018) might suffer from
regulation risks in the near term
Leading player in the lithium battery and e-cigarette industry
EVE Energy founded in 2001 specializes in the production and sales of lithium battery
products for use in smart meters smart transportation automotive electronics the
Internet of Things (IoT) consumer electronics new energy vehicles (NEVs) and energy
storage The Company is also engaged in the production and sales of atomization
Shenzhen Smoore Technology (Smoore) Smoore is currently in the process of applying
for an IPO in the Hong Kong market The e-cigarette business which has been booked
Multiple demand growth drivers for its core battery business
Management expects its primary lithium battery business revenue to reach Rmb21
23bn in 2019 implying 80% yoy growth This growth will be driven by rising ETC
(electronic toll collection) applications as the central government intends to implement
ETC nationwide on highways by the end of 2019 Management guided that its lithium-ion
battery business revenue will grow 50% yoy to Rmb4950bn in 2019 led by consumer
electronics and NEVs Management remains confident about its primary lithium battery
business growth outlook citing Chinas plans for large-scale development of its 5G
network which will provide demand growth opportunities for its products for IoT and
energy storage Its power battery products will also see revenue growth from its sales to
Daimler and Kia from 2020 Management estimated that total revenue in 2020 would
grow 50% yoy to Rmb10bn The Company will seek higher-quality earnings growth by
focusing on larger customers so we expect stable margins in 20192020
E-cigarette business growth subject to some regulatory risks
Its e-cigarette business revenue grew 100% pa over the past three years led by the
rising popularity of e-cigarettes Smoore is the market leader in supplying atomization
sustainable because of 1) replacement demand from old smokers and 2) incremental
demand from young people who just follow the fashion But recent industry news
indicates e-cigarette might be harmful to peoples health so the US and other countries
may consider banning e-cigarettes and its business might suffer from regulatory risks But
the impact is likely not that substantial according to management as 1) tougher
regulations might change industry dynamics but emerging new market players will still
have to rely on Smoore to supply the atomization products and 2) tougher regulations
are likely only for flavored e-cigarettes which account for only 30% of e-cigarette sales
Share price performance recently affected by regulatory concerns
The Companys share price more than doubled over the past 23 years led by strong
market expectations for its e-cigarette business But the share price recently fell c30%
due to unfavorable industry news The stock is trading at 19x 2020F PE based on market
consensus with a EPS growth of 34% However the EPS growth will depend on whether
there are tighter regulations on e-cigarette
