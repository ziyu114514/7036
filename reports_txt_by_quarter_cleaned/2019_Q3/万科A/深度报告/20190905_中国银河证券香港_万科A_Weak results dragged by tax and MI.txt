China Vanke-A
Weak results dragged by tax and MI
 Vanke As 1H19 results came in lower than expected with 11% earnings
growth on higher-than-expected LAT provision and minority interests
 We think Vanke should spin off its property management unit to unlock its
huge potential value as the unit could fetch a price of at least 22x FY20 PE
 Maintain Add with a lower TP of Rmb326 based on 9x FY19 PE
Weaker-than-expected results
Vanke A announced a weaker-than-expected set of results with 1H19 core net profit
rising 11% yoy to Rmb116bn 5% below our estimate on the back of higher-than-
expected LAT provision and minority interests 1H19 core net profit formed 30% of our
FY19F Net gearing was stable at 35% as at end-Jun 19
Its gross margin pre-land appreciation tax (LAT) was 28% 1% pts above our estimate
due to the recognition of property sales in 2017 and 1H18 when the property market was
very strong Its high gross margin is unlikely to be sustained considering surging land
costs so we expect it to decline by 2% pts pa on average over FY19-21F
Slow contracted sales growth on its high sales base
Vanke achieved contracted sales of Rmb382bn in 1H19 up 9% yoy Contracted sales
had grown at 29% CAGR in FY13-18 Given the high base we expect high single-digit
contracted sales growth in FY19-21F As of end-Jun it had sizeable unbooked sales of
Rmb622bn We expect most of this to be recognised in 2H19F and FY20F Thus we
estimate that it has locked in over 95% of FY19F earnings and 50% of FY20F earnings
Vanke should spin off its property management unit
Its property management (PM) units revenue rose 27% yoy to Rmb53bn in 1H19 We
expect the units revenue to surge to Rmb12bn in FY20F Assuming a 10% net profit
worth cRmb30bn In our view Vanke should consider spinning off the unit due to
Contribution from other businesses remains low
It also owns a set of non-property development businesses such as long-term rental
housing logistics and warehousing However they accounted for only 5% of its total
revenue in 1H19 We think management should put more effort into improving overall
earnings contribution in the medium- to long-term
We cut our FY19-21F EPS by 5-9% to reflect higher tax and finance costs as well as its
latest share placement Our TP is lowered to Rmb326 still based on FY19F PE of 9x (1
sd above its 5-year avg) Key catalysts include stronger-than-expected contracted sales
growth Key downside risks include further tightening policies imposed by the
government
