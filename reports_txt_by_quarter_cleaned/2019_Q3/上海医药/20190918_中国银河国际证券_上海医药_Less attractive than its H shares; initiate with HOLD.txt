Shanghai Pharmaceuticals-A
Less attractive than its H shares initiate with HOLD
 Overall we are positive on Shanghai Pharmas (SPH) fundamentals
 However the current AH spread of 43% is at historical high making SPHs A shares
less attractive than its H shares
 Our Target Price for SPHs A shares is Rmb200 (13x 2019F PER 1sd below the
the average) We initiate SPHs A shares with a HOLD rating
Manufacturing expected to continue its growth momentum
The manufacturing segment delivered 24% YoY revenue growth in 1H2019 to
RMB119bn Strong revenue growth came from the fast ramp-up of 60 key products
whose sales came in at RMB677bn up 313% YoY Despite price pressure the gross
margin was 5776% up 01ppt from 1H2018 due to 1) fast growth of the 60 high-margin
products and 2) more stringent cost management on raw material procurement and
manufacturing centralization Going forward we project revenue growth of 20%17%15%
in 20192021F respectively We expect the segment margin to be largely stable as
40% of the manufacturing segment is Chinese Traditional Medicines and most of
SPHs chemical generics are in the low-cost drug catalogue which are largely immune
from Group Purchase Organization (GPO) pressure
Distribution margin pressure can be relieved somewhat
The distribution segment delivered top-line growth of RMB8019bn in 1H2019 up 21%
YoY and the gross margin was 649% down 019 ppt from 1H2018 The distribution
segments robust revenue growth was due to the industrys organic growth (management
guided 8% YoY for 1H2019) and SPHs MA The gross margin for the distribution
segment was down 019 ppt in 1H2019 We believe the margin pressure came from drug
price cuts Going forward we expect more margin pressure considering 1) more
stringent medical reimbursement standards and more stringent prescription requirements
for physicians 2) a gradual impact of the GPO on drugs as the first round of the GPO
was implemented only in late March in a few cities so it had nearly no impact on the
gross margin of 1H2019 However we think 1) better-than-expected synergy with
Cardinal 2) continuing industry consolidation under the two invoice system and 3) a
higher percentage of direct sales and a product mix change will help mitigate gross
margin pressure
We believe near-term catalysts include 1) a growing stake increase by Shanghai
Shangshi (SPHs largest shareholder holding a 336% stake) 2) news flow on its RD
pipeline and 3) updates on collaboration with BIOCAD
Large AH premium makes SPHs A shares less attractive than its H
Currently SPHs AH spread remains at 43% which is a historical high (Figure 1)
making SPHs A shares less attractive than its H shares We believe the current large
AH spread may indicate H-share investors are more conservative than A-share
investors about the pharmaceutical industry growth slowdown and potential distribution
segment gross margin pressure from the GPO The Hang Seng AH Premium Index is
also near 3-year high partly because of the social unrest in Hong Kong A high AH
premium reduces the attractiveness of the SPHs A shares Our target price of Rmb20
for SPH-A implies a 264% premium over our target price for SPH-H not a big
