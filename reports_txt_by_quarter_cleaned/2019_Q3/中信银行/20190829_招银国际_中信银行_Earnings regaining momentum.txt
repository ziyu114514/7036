On 27 Aug CITICB reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 283bn up 101% YoY and
accounting for 605%618% of CMBISconsensus full-year estimates For 2Q19
PPoP maintained a double-digit growth of 101% YoY (vs 234% YoY in 1Q19)
(128% YoY) despite lower trading and investment return (-178% YoY) With
modest growth in provision charge (99% YoY) bottom-line earnings picked up
faster at 113% YoY (vs 86% YoY in 1Q19) 1H19 annualized ROE slid 01ppt
YoY to 138% We initiate coverage on CITICBs A-share with BUY rating
 Results positives 1) Loan growth accelerated to 63% in 1H19 (vs 57%
in 1H18) primarily boosted by retail segment (110% HoH) esp mortgage
and credit card That said asset quality of retail loans was well controlled as
retail NPL ratio edged down 10bp HoH to 09% We believe higher retail
exposure (18ppt HoH to 43%) would underpin a better-than-peers margin
trend amid LPR implementation process 2) Deposit growth was robust at
105% HoH despite lower proportion of demand deposits As a result LDR
declined 38ppt to 951% 3) 1H19 CIR fell 13ppt YoY to 265%
suggesting improving operating efficiency
 Results negatives 1) Provision coverage dropped 47ppt QoQ to
1652% lower than JSBs average of 193% NPL balance rose 3% QoQ on
faster formation yet NPL ratio was unchanged at 172% There might be
limited room to further lower credit cost until the Bank builds a more
interbank funding cost was offset by higher deposit cost amid deposit
and discounted bills 3) CET-1 and total CAR fell 19bp36bp QoQ to
858%1227% The Bank has issued RMB 40bn CB in Mar 2019 but
conversion may take time given its below-book valuation
