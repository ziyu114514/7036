Smart rail transportation industry leader core
business growth on track
 We initiate coverage on CRSC-A with a HOLD rating and a target price (TP) of
 CRSC-A had its total revenue grew 85% yoy and net profit grew 143% yoy in 1H19
The earnings growth in 1H19 was helped only by the core railway business We
expect its urban transit business growth to recover as well which will further drive
earnings growth acceleration in 2H19
 We are positive on CRSC-As earnings growth outlook in medium-to-long term
considering its leading position in the smart rail transportation market The Company
is the key beneficiary from accelerating rail transportation investment from both
central and local governments from 2019 onwards CRSC-A currently traded on 245x
2019F PE representing a 1234% premium to its H-shares The valuation is
make its share price more resilient
1H19 delivered solid net profit growth of 14%
Total revenue in 1H19 grew 85% yoy driven only by its core railway business (Fig 1) Its
gross profit margin expanded by 13ppt yoy to 233% in 1H19 because of an improved
revenue mix The Company scaled down its lower-margin cash construction business
while its higher-margin core railway business growth further accelerated in 1H19 Its
urban transit business also saw gross profit margin expansion due to the increasing
adoption of its own CBTC technology in its projects SGA costs rose more than revenue
growth in 1H19 Its net profit margin expanded by 07ppt yoy in 1H19 Net profit grew
143% yoy in 1H19 to Rmb2268m equivalent to 56% and 53% of our and consensus
full-year earnings estimates respectively
2H19 earnings growth expected to further accelerate
We expect its urban transit business growth to recover in 2H19 which will further drive its
earnings growth acceleration CRSC remains confident that it can deliver double-digit
revenue and earnings growth in 2019 CRSC expects its railway business revenue
growth to continue in 2H19 Railway equipment demand growth will be driven by
increases in new rail line additions in the 13th FYP and the deepening of railway operation
reforms CRSC reported that its railway business contract wins in 1H19 grew 301% yoy
The central government has been promoting the development of urban transit networks
to support economic growth and facilitate the development a few city clusters hence
investment in the urban transit network development started to reaccelerate in 2018 We
trim our earnings forecast for the Company in 20192020 by only 24% to reflect
weakness of the non-railway business Overall we expect its 2019F2020F net profit to
grow 150%237%
The Company listed its A-shares on the SSE STAR Market in July Proceeds from its A-
share listing will be used in 1) the RD of advanced intelligent rail transportation 2) the
development of an advanced rail electrification system manufacturing base in Changsha
3) the development of IT projects and 4) the replenishment of working capital These
growth With its strong position in the rail transportation control system market the
Company can leverage its technology and expertise to expand its product offerings along
We initiate coverage on CRSC-A with a HOLD rating and TP of Rmb960 Our TP is
based on a target PER multiple of 215x which is the average 2020 PE of domestic
peers Our A-share TP represents a 553% premium to ourH-share TP We think its A-
share valuation fully reflected its earnings growth potential in 2019-2020 but its listing in
SSE STAR Market will make its share price more resilient
