Summary Luxshare reported 2Q19 revenuenet profit growth of 88%80% YoY
beating consensus and mid-point of guidance of 60-93% YoY mainly due to
Luxshare also guided a strong 9M19 NP with 50-60% YoY implying 18-38% YoY
for 3Q19 NP in-line with ourconsensus estimates Luxshare is our A-share top
pick given its share gain in iPhoneAirpod in 2H19E and major 5G beneficiary into
2020 Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB321 based on 25x FY20E PE
Strong 2Q19 revenue across all segment Luxshares 2Q19 revenue
growth accelerated to 88% YoY vs 67% YoY in 1Q By segment consumer
electronics segment was the key driver with 99% YoY (78% of 1H19 sales)
thanks to share gain in AirPodacousticshaptics and expanding offerings
into LCP antenna and wireless charging modules In addition
with 52%46%164% YoY in 1H19E GPM was flattish at 195% given higher
mix of consumer electronics while better operating leverage was partly
offset by higher effective tax rate of 158% in 2Q19 (vs 93% in 2Q18)
New projects on track to boost growth We believe Luxshare will continue
to broaden penetration into Apple supply chain in 2H19E ranging from
Macbook iPad to iPhone and wearables (Watch AirPods) Despite iPhone
weakness in 2019 we expect share gain content growth to boost earnings
growth in 2H19E We also expect Luxshare to benefit from strong Airpod
shipment and upgrade with 55mn 80mn90mn units in FY192021E
 Outlook major 5G beneficiary and limited trade war impact Looking
ahead we believe Luxshare is well placed to capture 5G opportunities in
2020-21E given its solid product roadmap including 1) massive MIMO and
equipment In addition Luxshare is aggressively expanding capacity in
Vietnam in order to mitigate tariff impact in 2H19E2020E
 Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB321 We fine-tuned our FY19-21E EPS
estimates to factor in stronger revenue growth and higher tax rate We
maintained our TP RMB321 based on 25x FY20E PE 11% discount to 5-

Reiterate BUY with TP of Rmb321 (26% upside)
We derived our 12m TP of RMB320 based on 25x FY20E PE 11% discount to its 5-year
historical average of 282x We believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver
strong earnings growth market share gain and product expansion to capture 5G and
wireless opportunities in next 3-5 years
improvement for acousticshaptics and slower integration of acquired businesses
