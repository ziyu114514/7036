SUMMARY During our visit last week China Life impressed us with detailed
measures and recent achievements of its revitalization plan regarding two major
tasks this year - sales force development and investment yield improvement
Premium growth has been largely in line and NBV growth outlook is positive We are
optimistic about business recovery of the Company and initiate its A-share with BUY
rating Target price is RMB3310
Positive NBV and margin outlook 1) Although GWP growth lost steam in Mar
(-63% YoY) and Apr (-308% YoY) primarily due to last years high base and
decline of renewal premiums FYP restored double-digit growth in May
according to the Company 2) NBV margin improvement is likely to continue
thanks to higher share of longer-duration and protection-type products The
Company recorded stellar NBV growth of 283% in 1Q19 We forecast NBV to
increase 141% during the whole year
Agent reform- to integrate bancassurance sales force in 2H19 China Life
was the only lifer among major peers that achieved agent headcount growth in
1Q19 Exclusive individual agents reached 1537 million and total sales force
In 2H19 the Company plans to consolidate its bancassurance sales force
among which 90% are selling similar products as exclusive individual agents
China Life will also continue to promote differentiated sales to match customer
needs strengthen footing in higher-tier cities while maintaining leading position
in lower-tier ones and optimize incentive packages for agents
Beef up equity investment performance The Company is determined to
address weak spots in equity investment which used to cause large swings in
net profit Measures include 1) implementing market-based employment and
valuation system 2) strictly monitoring third-party entrustment 3) increasing the
percentage of long-term equity investment
Initiate BUY with TP at RMB3310 Given clear roadmap and solid steps of the
Companys reform plan we suggest investors to accumulate and bet on business
improvement We initiate A-share of the Company based on H-share TP plus 50%
premium (close to 1-year historical avg AH premium) The A-share stock is
currently trading at 093x FY19E PEV (vs peers average of 090x) Our TP
corresponds to 106x097x FY1920E PEV
