Positive earnings growth delivered in 1H19
 CRRC released its 1H19 results and hosted a results conference call after market
close on 29 August 2019
 The 1H19 results were largely in line with our and consensus earnings estimates
Total revenue in 1H19 rose 114% YoY while net profit in grew 162% YoY The growth
was driven mainly by its core railway and urban transit vehicle segments
 We remain positive on its core business growth outlook in 2H19 We maintain our
earnings forecast for the Company in 20192020 We cut our target price (TP) only
from Rmb1220 to Rmb1100 Our TP is based on our CRRC-H share valuation and
the historical AH premium (discount) We think the current CRRC-A valuation is
unjustified by its double-digit earnings growth potential We reiterate our ADD rating
on the stock
Solid 1H19 results
Total revenue rose 114% YoY in 1H19 with growth seen mainly in its core railway and
urban transit vehicle segments (Fig 1) Its core railway business (56% of total revenue in
1H19) had revenue growth of 203% YoY vs 115% YoY growth in 2018 This was led
vehicle business growth also accelerated 377% YoY in 1H19 vs 36% YoY growth in
2018 The new business segment reported revenue that was largely flat YoY in 1H19
with growth in its new energy equipment segment offsetting a revenue decline in its new
materials and auto parts business CRRC further scaled down its lower-margin modern
service business in 1H19 The gross profit margin contracted by 08ppt YoY to 225% in
1H19 due to changes in the revenue mix But SGA costs as a percentage of sales fell
from 155% in 1H18 to 147% in 1H19 due to effective cost control With the decrease in
financing costs its net profit margin expanded by 01ppt YoY and its net profit grew
162% YoY in 1H19
Core business growth outlook intact
We remain positive on the railway equipment demand growth outlook in 2H19 Railway
FAI will remain a key measure to help the central government ensure steady economic
growth At the results meeting management suggested that railway FAI in 2019F will
reach more than Rmb800bn with railway equipment investment reaching no less than
Rmb100bn implying 10% YoY growth China Railway Corporation (CRC) gave priority
to its corporate restructuring and business reforms in 1H19 hence it has barely made
any tenders on MUs CYTD But management expects CRC to win new tenders on MUs
freight wagons etc in 2H19 We expect its revenue growth in 2H19 to be driven by its
MU passenger carriage freight wagon and urban transit vehicle segments We expect its
revenue to grow 128% and 140% YoY in 2019F and 2020F respectively
Margin expansion to continue in 2H19
The gross profit margin contraction in 1H19 was mainly due to changes in the revenue
mix We expect its gross profit margin to remain stable in 20192020 given an improving
revenue mix We expect its SGA costs as a percentage of sales to further fall in 2019
2020 led by cost control from its continuous business streamlining Considering its
margin expansion potential we expect net profit to grow about 20% pa in 20192020F
High earnings growth visibility to drive valuation recovery
We reiterate our ADD rating for CRRC-A We slightly cut our TP from Rmb1220 to
Rmb1100 Our TP is based on our CRRC-H share valuation and the historical AH
premium (discount) We think the market was previously too bearish on CRRCs earnings
growth outlook The current valuation is unjustified by its double-digit earnings growth
potential in 2019 We expect its share price to react positively to the solid 1H19 results
