More uncertainties await in 2H19
 Grees 1H19 results were slightly above consensus and our estimates thanks to
 Selling expense and ASP cuts continue to pressure margins and earnings in 2H19
 The cash balance increased due to increase in payables
 Grees ownership transfer progress remains unclear The deadline for public
solicitation is 2 Sep
 We upgrade Gree to HOLD and revised our PER multiple from 95x to 12x to better
reflect Grees valuation discount to Mideas 14x
1H19 results slightly above expectation
Grees 1H19 results were slightly above consensus and our estimates Net profits grew
72% YoY in 1H19 to Rmb138b with the net profit margin staying flat at 140% EPS
smaller write-offs than a year ago Grees revenue growth slowed to 7% YoY in 1H1
Midea had cut its AC ASP by over 6% through sales promotion in end of Q1 This
38ppt YoY to 109% of sales in Q2
Selling expense and ASP cuts to pressure margins and earnings
As China AC sales continued to slump in July we expect Gree to only achieve mid-
single-digit full year top line growth and lower single-digit bottom line growth in the current
situation with high channel inventory and a slow property market We expect Gree to
adopted by major AC makers to chase market share in lower end models in 2H19 As a
result ASP cuts and increased selling expense should put Grees margins and earnings
growth under pressure in 2019
Cash balance increased but this is due to increase in payables
In 1H19 Grees increased its cash level by Rmb8bn YoY to Rmb121bn since 2018 The
increase in cash was financed mainly by a substantial 60% increase (Rmb30b) in
accounts payable Recently Gree has stepped up its business diversification efforts It
recently formed a strategic partnership with NEV maker WM Motor signaling another
attempted foray into the NEV industry after its failure of acquiring Zhuhai Yinlong Gree is
also in the process of acquiring 11% of handset maker Wingtech We expect the growth
in capex and investment to continue in 2H19 However these diversifications are unlikely
to have a significant impact on earnings in the near-term
Grees ownership transfer remains unclear
This April Grees parent Gree Group started to solicit offers to sell 15% stakes in Gree
by the Gree Group to review the acquisition proposals submitted We believe this will
We dont believe the small earnings beat by Gree in 1H19 will remove the overhang on
the stock  the industry outlook the impact of the consumer stimulus in 2020 Grees
diversification efforts and the result of the share tender We upgrade Gree to HOLD and
better reflect Grees valuation discount to Mideas 14x
