SUMMARY We believe SANYs growth is on a good track with a couple of
positive drivers (1) the rebound of excavator sales in Jun is a positive sign (2)
SANYs strong execution to continue to drive further market share gain (3) strong
growth of crane and concrete machinery sales to sustain Stock is trading at 11x
2019E consensus earnings which we think is not excessive as we expect the
upcycle to continue driven by strict environmental policies and replacement
 Sales of excavator rebounded in Jun According to CCMA sales volume of
excavator (25 major producers in China) grew 66% YoY to 15k in Jun
following a 22% decline in May Sales in China was down only 03% YoY in
Jun much better than the 58% decline in May Export remained robust in Jun
with sales volume surging 56% YoY the highest YTD in terms of both growth
rate and absolute figure In 1H19 sales of excavator grew 142% YoY We
believe the run rate is still on track to reach our full year estimate of 15%
 SANYs market share gain likely to continue Chinese excavator makers
have been gaining market share for years On the back of rapid improvement
in product quality precise marketing strategy and excellent management
substantially from 12% in 2011 to 26% in 5M19 significantly outpacing all
market share gain SANY targets to achieve sales volume of 20% YoY in
 Explosive growth of crane and concrete machinery We understand that
SANYs crane machinery sales growth reached 100% YoY in 1H19E
significantly higher than the industry average of 50-60% For concrete
machinery SANYs concrete pump truck sales volume growth reached 100%
YoY in 1H19E SANY is particularly bullish on this segment as the entire
demand is driven by replacement at present We expect SANY to continue to
deliver much higher growth than the industry average going forward
