PPoP rose moderately by 43% YoY (vs 157% YoY in 1Q19) as growth in both
to a YoY decline in trading gains However bottom-line earnings growth was
largely stable at 48% YoY (vs 49% YoY in 1Q19) thanks to tax savings from
rising investment in tax-free government bond 1H19 annualized ROE slid
02ppt YoY to 128%
 Results positives 1) Healthy loan growth of 57% HoH outpaced total
asset growth of 37% HoH 1H19 new loans was mainly from corporate
segment (80% HoH) as retail loans (11% HoH) were held back by falling
credit card overdrafts (-100% HoH) Outstanding discounted bills surged
417% HoH suggesting the Banks falling risk appetite 2) Deposit growth

 Results negatives 1) 2Q19 NIM contracted 3bp QoQ to 156% by our
estimate Despite lower interbank funding cost (-15bps HoH) deposit cost
large proportion of interbank liability BoCom would gain more from
monetary easing but marginal benefit should diminish going forward 2)
Retail loan exposure declined 15ppt to 322% BoComs below-peers
retail loan proportion could make it more vulnerable to interest rate
liberalization although the Bank said during results briefing that the pricing
of 70% new loans YTD was already based on LPR 3) 1H19 CIR was 14ppt
higher at 362% as opex rose 168% YoY Management explained
