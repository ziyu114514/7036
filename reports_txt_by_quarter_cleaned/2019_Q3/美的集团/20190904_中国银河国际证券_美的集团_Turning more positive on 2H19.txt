Turning more positive on 2H19
 Mideas 1H19 results surprised to the upside net profit grew 165% YoY above our
expectation and consensus of 14% growth
 Mideas lower AC exposure should help it maintain its current margins in 2H19 in the
 Midea is better positioned for the potential consumption stimulus due to its more
diversified product offerings
 We upgrade our rating to ADD and increase our TP from Rmb480 to Rmb600 to
account for better-than-expected 1H19 earnings growth and improved margins in the
AC and consumer appliance segments
1H19 results surprised to the upside
Mideas net profit grew 16% YoY to Rmb161b in 1H19 above our expectation and
consensus of 14% growth The net margin expanded by 08ppt YoY to 104% Net profit
product investment and cash deposits Revenue grew 74% YoY driven mainly by the
core AC and consumer appliance segments The gross margin expanded by 2ppt to
297% despite the AC sales promotion Midea started in Q1 thanks to lower raw material
costs and higher ASPs in other key product categories such as refrigerators Operating
margins grew only 05ppt to 109% owing to higher selling expense from promotions
Lower AC exposure should mean less margin erosion in 2H19
Because of high channel inventory (45 months) and new AC energy-efficiency
ASPs in 2H19 to chase market share and trim inventory levels ACs accounted for 46%
of Mideas total sales in 1H19 and we estimate refrigerators and washing machines
2H19 we expect Mideas higher exposure in other key home appliance categories to help
it minimize potential margin erosion in 2H19
On 27 Aug the State Council released an Opinion to encourage local governments to
support the sales promotion of energy efficient ACs refrigerators and washing machines
And earlier this year the NDRC released a guideline to potentially boost home appliance
sales by Rmb700b in 20192021 So far only Beijing and Guangxi have rolled out their
stimulus plans but we expect other regions to follow in 2H19 and 2020 We expect the
new round of stimulus to focus more on replacement demand than new demand as the
penetration of major appliances is approaching saturation in both urban and rural areas
We also expect the stimulus to benefit pure AC makers less considering the current high
channel inventory We think Midea is an easily identifiable beneficiary of the stimulus
because of its higher exposure to the mid- to high-end refrigerator washing machine and
key small appliance segments
We upgrade our rating to ADD and increase our TP from Rmb480 to Rmb600 to
account for better-than-expected 1H19 earnings growth and improved margins in the AC
and consumer appliances segments We now value Midea at 14x 2020 earnings vs the
consumption stimulus We continue to prefer Midea because of its stronger balance
sheet more diversified revenue mix and long-term product upgrade story
