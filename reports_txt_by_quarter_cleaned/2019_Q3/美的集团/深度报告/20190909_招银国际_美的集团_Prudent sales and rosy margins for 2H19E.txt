9 Sep 2019
Midea reported exceptional market shares gain in 1H19 thanks to its technology
break-through in AC and multi-brand strategy Given a better raw material price
and currency trend we are more positive on 2H19E NP growth Hence we
maintain BUY and raised TP to RMB 6496 based on 16x FY20E PE (rolled over
from 18x FY19E) or 11x PEG
 1H19 net profit up 17% slight beat Mideas net profit rose 17% YoY to RMB
152bn inline with CMBI and 2% above BBGs est Sales growth was 8%
inline The beat was aided mainly by robust GP margin expansion jumping by
23ppt to 295% in 1H19 (vs 272% in 1H18) thanks to 1) falling raw material
costs (copper -6% aluminum -5% and steel -8% etc) Midea benefited more
vs peers due to its high self-production rate 2) favorable FX (CNY -5% YTD)
and 3) Mideas multi-brand strategy (launch of high-end positioned COLMO in
Oct 2018 and Midea PRO series in Mar 2019 internet brand BUGU 布谷in
Mar 2019 and brand targeting youth WAHIN华凌 in 2019) However due to
greater AP and RD expenses NP margin only increased by 08ppt to 99%
 Exceptional achievement (esp on AC) in 1H19 Despite a 4% drop in
AC industry sales Mideas AC sales surged by 12% YoY in 1H19 (market
share climbed to 27%30% on offlineinline in 1H19 vs 25%23% in 2018) We
attribute such impressive results to its innovations (eg more products
equipped with the windless technology winning the 2019 AWE Epland Gold
Award) Washing machines Refrigerator small appliances sales growth were
6%10%low-single digit in 1H19 vs industry growth of 3% -1% 5%
 Prudent sales and rosy margins for 2H19E The Company targets a 5-10%
sales growth in FY19E and expects a GP margin expansion plus a faster
growth for net profit AC sales growth slowed down to 10% in JulAug 2019
according to management However in our view that should not be a worry
as margin should continue to improve given softening raw material prices and
highly healthy level of channel inventory at 5-6mn units (vs industrys 20-
30mn) Also we see potential upsides from export businesss GP margin
since CNY had already further depreciated vs USD in 2H19E KUKA sales
missed in 1H19 but management suggested a better 2H19E for both sales
and EBITDA margin
 Maintain BUY and raised TP to RMB 6496 (20% upside) Our new TP is
based on 16x FY20E PE (rolled over from 18x FY19E) We lifted
FY19E20E21Es net profit by 19%11%02% to factor in 1) better AC
sales 2) declining raw material costs and currency rate and 3) greater RD
expenses The counter now trades at 15x 13x FY19E 20E PE with 26%
