On 28 Aug CCB reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 1542bn up 49% YoY and
accounting for 570%584% of CMBISconsensus full-year estimates 1H19
gains and investment return) picked up 128% YoY Thanks to slower
expansion in opex and impairment charges bottom-line earnings grew faster at
55%% YoY in 2Q19 (vs 42% YoY in 1Q19) 1H19 annualized ROE declined
1ppt YoY to 159% still the highest of the Big-4 banks  We initiate coverage
on CCB A-share with BUY rating
bank card wealth management and electronic banking services As a result
272% 2) Asset quality continued to improve as NPL ratio fell 3bp QoQ
to 143% and provision coverage climbed 38ppt to 218% However we note
that overdue loans rebounded 182% HoH and we would seek for
managements explanation during results briefing 3) Credit growth was
prudent The Bank maintained a stable growth in mortgage (53% HoH)
while reduced personal consumption loan (-171% HoH) Lending to utility
and construction segments and discounted bills accounted for near 50% of
new corporate loans 4) Capital position remained strongest in the
sector as CET 1total CAR only slid 13bp8bp QoQ to 137%171% due to
appropriation of cash dividend in 2Q19
 Results negative 1) 2Q19 NIM contracted 4bp QoQ to 225% as liability
cost went up faster than asset yield Given higher proportion of deposit
funding CCB may not benefit as much as most joint-stock peers during
monetary loosening but we believe the weaker margin trend was within
expectation 2) Proportion of demand deposit fell 05% HoH to 531%
leading to rising deposit cost thereby smaller net interest spread 3) Asset
growth slowed to 08% in 2Q19 from 42% in 1Q19 as interbank assets
pulled back 17% QoQ
 Initiate CCB-A with BUY rating and RMB 88 TP We expect a positive
share price reaction to 1H19 results CCB-A currently trades at 083x FY19E
PB in line with its past 5-year mean Our TP of RMB 88 is based on GGM-
derived target PB of 105x and FY19E BPS of RMB 83
