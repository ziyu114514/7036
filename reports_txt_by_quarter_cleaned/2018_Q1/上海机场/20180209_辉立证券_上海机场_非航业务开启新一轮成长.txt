億元，同比增長279%，基本每股收益14 元，同比增長28%。第三季度營業收入同比

毛利率勁升38 個百分點至
個百分點至482%
T1 航站樓改造工程完成後，公司的成本端的增速保持平穩，2017 年前三季度公司的營
業成本僅增長74%，遠低於收入增速，毛利率因此大幅提高38 個百分點至482%。
三項費用比率因利息收入減少較同期增加了13 個百分點至203%，最終經營利潤率仍
同比增加了25 個百分點。

我們發現，相對於國內航線起降架次增速的逐月下行，國際航線起降架次增速
呈現逐月抬升的態勢，反映機場新增航線資源傾向於分配給國際航線。另一方
面，旅客人次增速高於飛機架次增速2 個百分點，飛機機型大型化趨勢明顯，
這一特徵在國內航線上表現得更加明顯。貨郵輸送量337 萬噸，同比增長
128%，其中國際航線明顯勝出，保持兩位數升幅。
第四季度公司的飛機起降架次，旅客輸送量和貨郵輸送量分別同比增長42%，
84%和57%。國際航線保持相對更高的飛機起降架次和旅客輸送量增速，同
時，地區航線出現回暖。
近期中國民航總局為了提升正點率對機場提出航班限制措施，對公司航班起降
架次的增長將起到一定限制作用，但考慮到公司能夠通過調整航班結構、調升
國際航班比例和寬體機比例等措施應對，以及公司充裕的產能拓展空間，我們
預計該負面影響將非常有限。

受益于T1 航站樓改造工程全面投入使用後商業面積的擴大和國際航線旅客占比
提高，2017 公司的非航業務收入一舉躍升超過航空性業務收入。公司的機場免
稅業務合同將於2018 年3 月到期，預計新一輪招標新的提成比例由原來的25%
上漲至45%左右，將大幅提高非航業務收入。此外，2019 年S1S2 衛星廳建成
投入運營後，航站樓總建築面積將擴大69%，旅客輸送量將超過8000 萬，由此
帶來的商業面積拓寬和消費人數提升將為公司下一輪業績成長提供堅實的支
