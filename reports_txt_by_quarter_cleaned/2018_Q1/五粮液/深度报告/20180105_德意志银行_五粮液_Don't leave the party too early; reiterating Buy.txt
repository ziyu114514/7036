Entering secular growth cycle
After Wuliangyes 130% share price hike in past 12 month market has increasing
concerns on whether there is still upside Our view is positive We expect the
at 29% CAGR in 2018-20 driven by managements strong incentives for growth
and expanding high end liquor market after Moutai raising price We revise up
our target price to Rmb98 implying 27x 2018 PE We reiterate Buy

gross sales of Rmb40bn in 2018 and Rmb60bn in 2020 (vs Rmb30bn in 2017E)
Management will invest in channel penetration brand building and products

Moutais price hike to release more market for Wuliangye
On Dec 29 Moutai announced to raise ex-factory price by 18% to Rmb969bottle
and set retail price at Rmb1499bottle As a result the ex-factory price gap of
Moutai over Wuliangye expands from 10% to 30% We believe Wuliangye is the
biggest beneciary of the price hike helped by the expanding high end liquor
market room released by Moutai
We reiterate Buy revising up TP to Rmb98

better volume growth mix upgrade and margin expansion and revise up target
price by 40% to Rmb98 based on DCF model We are changing our valuation
methodology from EVEBITDA to DCF as we believe DCF model can incorporate

External driver Moutais price hike to release more market
On Dec 29 Moutai announced to raise ex-factory price by 18% to Rmb969bottle
and raise suggested retail price to Rmb1499bottle (from Rmb1299bottle) After
the price adjustment the ex-factory price gap of Moutai vs Wuliangye expands
from 10% to 30% and suggested retail price gap expand from 18% to 36%

Moutais price hike should result in increasing demand for Wuliangye In the
retail end the expanding price gap will lead to part of private consumption (which
is price sensitive) switching from Moutai to Wuliangye Meanwhile distributors
will have less incentives to store up Moutai after price hike and therefore left more
cash ow for Wuliangye procurement We forecast volume growth of premium
Wuliangye to speed up helped by the expanding price gap

Key takeaways from 1218 distributor meeting

Revising up earnings 12-42% in 2018-20
For 2018 we forecast 31% sales growth which is largely in line with management
guidance factoring 18% volume growth for mainstream products 12% price
increase from product mix and 33% sales growth from low end mass products
Meanwhile we expect Wuliangyes net margin to expand in 2018 helped by
increasing portion of super premium products lower channel subsidies and
operating leverage
For 2019-20E we are revising up our earnings forecast by 26%-42% to factor in
Wuliangye
managements increasing investment in channel and branding
meanwhile Moutais price hike also expand high end liquors market
more marketing resources to the categories
6-10% annual price increase driven by mix upgrade and price hike

Revising up target price to Rmb98 reiterating buy
Based on new earnings forecast we are revising up target price by 40% to Rmb98
base on DCF model factoring in 95% WACC (39% RFR 56% ERP 10 beta
debt-free structure) and a 2% terminal growth rate (in line with long term ination
rate) We reiterate Buy on the stock Our target price implies 27x PE with 29%
earnings CAGR in 2018-20 we think this is reasonable given
Our target PE is slightly lower than 30x 2018 PE for China liquor sector
Wuliangye currently trades at 10% discount to Moutais due to its weaker
to our 30x target PE on Moutai
We are changing valuation methodology from EVEBITDA to DCF approach
because 1) we believe DCF approach could incorporate Wuliangyes long-term
helped by its investment in channels and brandings 2) DCF approach could
also incorporate Wuliangyes increasing cash ow generating capabilities with
increasing branding powers Wuliangyes working capital is improving as it
require increasing number of distributors to make advance payment before
delivery Downside risk channel de-stocking in high-end liquor sector food
safety worse than expected macro xed asset investment slow down

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
