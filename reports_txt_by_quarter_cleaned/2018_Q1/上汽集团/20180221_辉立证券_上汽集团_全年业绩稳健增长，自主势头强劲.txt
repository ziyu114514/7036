根據上汽集團發佈的業績預告，2017 年度，集團實現歸屬母公司淨利潤342 億元，同
比上年同期增加22 億元，同比增速為7%。扣除非經常性損益後為327 億元，同比增
加78%。2017 年全年上汽集團共銷售汽車693 萬輛，同比增長69%，基本完成年初
預計的銷量目標。銷量增速高於行業平均55 個百分點，顯示了強勁的增長態勢。利
潤增速高於銷量增速反映公司盈利能力有所提升。
旗下各合資車企表現不一：上汽大眾銷售了2063 萬輛，同比增長306%，上汽通用同
比增長599%至200 萬輛，上汽通用五菱銷量同比增長093%至215 萬輛。集團分別有
3 款，4 款車型名列年度最賣座轎車和SUV 的前十名，3 款MPV 車型佔據年度最賣座

上汽通用的品牌結構升級趨勢顯著，首先，高端MPV 紅利持續，GL8 同比增長
82%至145 萬輛，新車GL6 不負所望，爬坡迅速。其次，高端品牌凱迪拉克
（56%yoy）和雪佛蘭的邁銳寶（45%yoy）增速耀眼。中高級車型別克君越、
君威和雪佛蘭邁銳寶合計銷售287 萬輛，同比增長23%，中高級車細分市場市
占率快速增長至近20%，進一步鞏固了在中高級乘用車細分市場的龍頭地位。
2018 年上汽通用將迎來凱越的換代，對標奧迪Q3 的一款小型SUV 凱迪拉克
上汽大眾的車型結構上移明顯，SUV 車型占比從2016 年的145%提高到2017 年
的238%，並在SUV 市場上補足短板，在中型-中大型SUV 市場完成產品覆蓋。
上汽大眾17 年推出的三款高端SUV：途觀L，途昂，柯迪亞克，均價高於20 萬
元，途觀L 的月均銷量超過18 萬輛，並在四季度站穩兩萬輛，途昂月均超
6000 輛，年底超過萬輛，柯迪亞克實現月均5000 輛，充分實現了品牌溢價優
勢，我們認為未來將繼續受益於SUV 消費升級潮流。 2018 年上汽大眾將推出一
款入門級緊湊型SUV 車型T-Roc 和迎來帕薩特的換代，斯柯達也將推出兩款小
型SUV（KAROC，Model Q）。
由於560 和730 銷量的下滑、更新換代產品510 和310 表現不及預期，上汽通
用五菱的銷量基本持平，也反映緊湊型SUV 和微車市場競爭愈加激烈，我們預
期未來上汽通用五菱將通過加密產品線來吸引目標客戶。

上汽自主品牌乘用車銷量為522 萬輛，同比勁升623%，其中，SUV 銷售356
萬輛，同比增長1526%，在SUV 市場中的份額達345%，同比提高19 個百分
點。強勁的銷售勢頭主要來自於榮威RX5，累計銷量達2376 萬輛，同比增
1639%，新車榮威i6 和名爵 ZS 也有不錯表現。2018 年上汽乘用車將繼續佈局
SUV 產品線，除了2017 下半年上市的新車榮威RX3 與全新名爵6，還將推出一
款大型7 座SUV。
上汽乘用車的新能源車型2017 年實現了翻番的增長，共銷售44 萬輛，未來除
了現有車型的新能源版本外，造勢良久的榮威光之翼新能源車也將在年中
左右推出，續航400km 以上，百公里加速45 秒，搭載了擡頭顯示、無線充
電、智慧駕駛等高科技配置，表現值得期待。綜上，我們預計上汽乘用車仍可
維持高於行業平均的銷量增速。
同時上汽乘用車將加快推動互聯網、大資料、人工智慧與汽車產業深度融合，
努力構建驅動創新轉型的新動能，並建立完善創新生態系統，持續激發廣大員
工創新創業的新活力，繼續加快商業模式創新，在已有基礎上，向更廣領域探
索，提升產品競爭力。
