We forecast 23% top-line and 25% bottom-line growth in 2018 We have
penetrate China As a result FMs management said that its internet clients are

frames to increase to 16m and LCD screens to increase to 300000 up c20%
yoy We raise our 20182019 earnings forecasts by 11% and 12% to reflect this
Internet FMCG education and Baijiu seeing high growth
InternetFMCG clients such as JD Ali Baidu and PG contributed c 50% of
FMs ad revenue and their growth remains robust as they are paying more
attention to the inner building and cinema advertisement channels Our

cash PER of 24x (it had RMB38bn net cash as of 9M17) on our 2018E earnings
