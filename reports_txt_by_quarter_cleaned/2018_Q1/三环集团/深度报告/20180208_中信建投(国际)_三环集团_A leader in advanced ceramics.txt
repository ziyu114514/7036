A leader in advanced ceramics
Three-Circle Group takes lead in the production and sales of ceramic-
substrates and ceramic matrices used in resistors
Ceramic chassis Three-Circle Group is well placed to benefit from the
would-be introduction of ceramic housing by Chinas incumbent big
three smartphone makers Huawei Oppo and Vivo as different from its
domestic peers Three-Circle Group is self-sufficient in ceramic powder
able to produce 1mn pieces of ceramic chassis per month
Multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC) A dearth of MLCC supply
the prices of palladium a key ingredient of MLCC together with
increasing demand emanating from such burgeoning areas as EV and
smartphones would spur and sustain a MLCC price upturn in our view
providing tailwinds for Three-Circle Group whose MLCC division earned
around RMB100mn in 2016 accounting for 4% of its full-year revenue
business claimed a market share of more than 80% by year-end 2017 up
from the previous 50% thanks mainly to a practice of price-cutting since
the beginning of 2016 on the back of its self-sufficiency in ceramic
powder and economies of scale Looking ahead as 5G deployment is
strategy in our view
Electroceramic packaging Three-Circle Groups semiconductor devices
unit (including electroceramic packaging) recorded a 2016 operating
of Kyocera Hence there is plenty of scope for Three-Circle Group to keep
up with its arch rival
Earnings forecast We predict Three-Circle Group to have net profit
attributable to the parent of RMB1078bn1551bn2111bn for 2017-
2019 corresponding to EPS of RMB062090122 and 35x24x18x PER
Our six-month target price of RMB2960 is based on a 33x PER for 2018

Ceramic chassisMLCC
Metal as a conductor will absorb or reflect radio waves and thus causes wireless interference As a result ceramic and
glass chassis which are free of such an off-putting nature while bestowed with properties such as high rigidity and
excellent surface polish are gaining in popularity among smartphone makers as the world ushers in the new era of
wireless charging and 5G
