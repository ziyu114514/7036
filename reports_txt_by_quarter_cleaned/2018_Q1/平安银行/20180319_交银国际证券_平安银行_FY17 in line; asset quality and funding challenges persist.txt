FY17 in line asset quality and funding challenges persist
 We resume coverage on Ping An Bank (PAB) with a Neutral rating and a TP of
RMB1180 We believe the improving retail banking franchise bodes well for PABs
long-term profitability However we see limited upside from PABs current valuation
given the funding cost and asset quality challenges PABs FY17 net profit was in line
with Wind consensus with lower credit cost partly offsetting the NIM contraction
NPL formation rate improved but remained at the high end among banks we cover
 Asset quality improved but pressure persists PABs NPL ratio declined by 5bps
QoQ to 170% at end-2017 thanks to the aggressive write-off NPL formation rate
declined slightly HoH in 2H17 to 246% under our estimation but remained among
the highest of banks we cover Provision coverage ratio declined 1ppt QoQ to 151%
at end-2017 and loan loss reserve was at 257% of total loans down 9bps QoQ
NPLs was equivalent to 70% of 90-day overdue loans With the less prudent NPL
classification and high NPL formation rate we believe provision pressure remains
241% in 9M17 The NIM further contracted in 4Q17 due to higher interbank
funding cost and lower loan yield with lower risk appetite in our view Given its
weaker deposit franchise and continuous loan structure adjustment we believe
PABs NIM will remain under pressure amid tight liquidity
 Building up retail banking franchise Retail banking made up 44% of total revenue
in 2017 up from 31% in 2016 Credit card loans increased by 68% YoY in 2017 and
total retail loansdeposits accounted for 50%47% of total loansdeposits at end-
2017 Leveraging on Ping An Groups franchise we expect PABs retail franchise to
improve further and support its profitability in the long term

Asset Quality Pressure Persists
PABs NPL ratio was down 4bps YoY and 5 bps QoQ in 4Q17 which may be driven by its
aggressive write-offs in our view NPL write-offs and transfers amounted to RMB37bn
in 2017 up 6% YoY equivalent to around 144% of NPLs at end-2016 Overdue loan
balance declined 13% HoH in 2H17 and special-mention loan balance also declined by
5% HoH in 2H17 indicating improving asset quality
However PABs NPL formation rate remained at 246% in 2H17 under our estimation
among the highest of banks we cover We believe PAB still has to maintain relatively
high write-offs for stable NPL ratios Given the 151% NPL coverage ratio close to the
regulatory requirement of 150% we believe the provision pressure remains high

SML ratio declined in 2H17

NIM Contracted due to High Interbank Funding Cost
PABs interbank liability made up around 30% of total liabilities (including NCD and
borrowing from PBOC) at end-2017 up from 26% at end-2016 The surge in interbank
market rates resulted in higher interbank funding cost and pressured PABs NIM PABs
given the asset quality deterioration pressure PAB turned more cautious on risky loans
in our view and some new loan pricing is lower than that in the past few years
Although PAB increased its high-yield retail loans the overall loan yield declined in 2H17
by our estimates
We expect PABs NIM to remain under pressure in the near term given the high
interbank market rates risk appetite adjustments and relatively weak deposit franchise

Limited Capital Buffer
PABs CET1 declined 4bps QoQ and 8bps YoY to 828% at end-2017 slightly higher than
regulatory requirement of 75% We expect higher capitalization pressure in 2018 for
PAB considering the higher risk weighting for interbank investment and credit shift
from off-balance-sheet to balance-sheet assets PAB announced its plan to issue
RMB26bn convertible bonds (CB) in mid-2017 However it may take some time to
transfer the CB into core capital after the issuance in our view
PAB adjusted its exposure to interbank investments and off-balance-sheet WMP in
2H17 Interbank investments balance declined 26% HoH and off-balance-sheet WMP
balance was down 15% HoH in 2H17

Building up Retail Franchise
The operating profit and revenue of PABs retail banks accounted for 67% and 44% of
total respectively in 2017 The proportion of retail loans and deposits also increased in
2017 In general retail loan pricing is higher than corporate loans and the credit cost is
less affected by economic cycles in China  We believe better retail banking franchise
may help PAB to improve its asset quality and NIM in the long term
increased by 10% YoY in 2017 despite the declines in WMPs and consulting fees as its
bank card fees increased by 49% YoY
