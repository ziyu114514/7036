Increasing risk of over supply in 2018
Turning more prudent near-term
We think Moutais channel restocking cycles could be peaking with expanding
bubbles in its retail pricing recently As retail prices are (currently at
Rmb1700-1800) approaching the historic peak level (Rmb2000 in 2012) Moutais
investment demand and real consumption demand could be impacted in 2018
while supply looks set to increase As a result we think oversupply could pressure
real retail prices Though this wont impact Feitian Moutais ex-factory sales
potential weakening in retail prices could pressure market sentiment
2017 Channel restocking demand is main growth driver
There are two sources of demand for Feitian Moutai - real consumption demand
and investment demand During the retail price hike cycle real consumption
demand could decline due to price elasticity and instead investment demand or
channelsocial restocking demand would increase driven by markets price hike
expectation In 2017 we estimate real consumption demand has declined 10%
yoy to 24000 tons and channelsocial stocking demand has absorbed 7000 tons
2018 Supply set to increase while demand might decline
As Feitian Moutais current retail price is approaching its historic peak level the
expected ROI for channel stocking in 2018 is much lower than in 2017 This should
lead to lower interest by investors and distributors to stock up on the liquor
Meanwhile distributors normally have less incentive to stock up inventories after
manufacturers raise ex-factory prices (Moutai announced a raise in price on Dec
2017) On the other hand real consumption could also decline in 2018 due to the
higher retail price On the supply side Moutai has announced it will raise supply
by 76% to 28000 tons The increasing supply and declining demand might lead
to a potential over supply situation in 2018
Three potential impacts of over supply
If Moutai enters an over supply situation the retail price might be under pressure
in near-term In a softer retail price scenario the subsequent results could be
1) distributorsinvestors further clean up inventories and enhance over supply
2) weaker sales for super premium products and 3) weaker demand for ex-
quota Feitian volumes These could pressure its share price in near-term Besides
positioning in consumers trading up demand

Channel restocking demand is main growth driver in 2017
Moutais demand includes real consumption demand and investment demand
Moutais sales value grew by 50% and sales volume grew by 35% in 2017 We
dont think such strong growth can be fully explained by consumers trading up
demand Instead a strong investment demand recovery would be the main driver
in 2017 Specically
Investment demand From 2H16 market began to build up expectations
that Moutais retail price would continue to rally With such an
expectation liquor investors began enter the market including
distributors institutions (property developers and cola miners) and high
net wealth individuals Some consumers also purchased Moutai in
advance to avoid future price hikes We estimate Moutais channel
has absorbed 7000 tons of ex-factory volume representing 23% of
Moutais ex-factory volume in 2017 (The channel released 4000 tons
of Moutai to the market in 2016)
Real consumption demand Feitian Moutais average retail price rose
by 50% in 2017 to Rmb1400 After the rally the liquor became less
aordable for private consumption During our channel checks some
distributors also indicated that they were beginning to be concerned
about whether the corkage ratio would decline after retail price hike
As Moutais private consumption portion has increased since 2012
Moutais real consumption to decline 10% yoy to 24000 tons in 2017
(Figure 2)
The market in 2017 is similar as what the market experienced in Moutais re-
stocking cycle during 2011 In 2011 the retail price rose from Rmb1300 in
year beginning to Rmb2000 in early 2012 The channel restocking became a key
growth driver and resulted in undersupply in the retail market (Figure 1) (Refer to
our report The restocking cycle  published on June 22 2017 for more details)
After recent the restocking cycle in 2016-17 we forecast Moutais channelsocial
inventory to be 13000 tons by the end of 2017 representing 6 months of its
real consumption (Figure 3)

2018 could enter an over supply situation
If Moutais retail price remains at current levels both investment demand and
consumption demand could begin to decline in 2018 In our base case we
estimate a typical Feitian liquor investors 1 year expected return to decline
from highest level at Rmb500 in Jan 2017 to Rmb200 in Jan 2018 and the ROI
(expected returnspot market price) to decline from 40% in Jan 2017 to 10% in
Jan 2018 (Figure 3) as cost to build up inventories are rising signicantly in past
12 months As a result we forecast investment demand to decline 50% yoy to
3500 tons Meanwhile due to rising retail prices and price elasticity we forecast
real consumption demand to decline 10% yoy to 22000 tons This implies that
total demand would decline 20% yoy to 25500 tons in 2018 (Figure 2)

Figure 4 Whats the expected return to store Moutai for 12 months
SourceDeutsche Bank the expected return  expected future retail price in 12 months less spot retail price
Moutai has announced an increase in supply by at least 7% to 28000 tons in 2018
We believe this number is referred to planned volume before including ex-
quota volume To recap Moutais actual volume is 31000 tons in 2017 including
both planned volume and out of quota volume Yet even based on the planned
volume at 28000 tons it will be still higher than total demand of 25000 tons
result in an over supply situation
If Moutai enters an oversupply scenario in 2018 various potential events could
pressure market sentiment including 
Channel de-stocking If the price hike expectation switches to price
decline expectation the channel restocking could switch into a
destocking cycle The incremental supply from channel could enhance
the destocking cycle itself
Weaker demand of super premium Moutai We forecast that super
premium Moutai or customized Moutai contributed 10% sales growth
in 2017 We expect the portion of investment demand is higher for super
premium Moutai than for Feitian Moutai Therefore weaker investment
demand could impact super premium Moutai harder
ex-quota Feitian volumes might decline Within over supply situation
Moutai might reduce its out of quota Feitian to support retail price

We still like Moutai for its long-term solid growth
In the long term we still expect Moutai to generate solid growth with its strong
branding and increasing channel operating capability We are maintaining a Buy

factoring in 95% WACC (39% RFR 56% ERP 10 beta debt-free structure)

Macroeconomic uctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay xed or variable interest rates For an investor who is long xed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ows) increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ows and thus
cause a loss The longer the maturity of a certain cash ow and the higher the move in the discount factor the
higher will be the loss Upside surprises in ination scal funding needs and FX depreciation rates are among the
segmentation regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for dierent types of investors) changes in tax
policies currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion repatriation of prots andor liquidation of
positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements
