Access China conference highlights
Growth to continue till 2020
Mr Bo Li Deputy General Manager and Secretary of Tianqi Lithiums Board of
Directors attended our 2018 dbAccess China conference in Beijing this week Mr
for Tianqi We summarize below the key highlights from the investor meetings
Maintain Hold
Expect relatively resilient pricing for high-quality battery grade lithium
The battery grade lithium carbonate price corrected by RMB5kt from its peak at
over RMB170kt by end-2017 but Tianqi does not expect meaningful correction of
supply from brine extraction in TibetQinghai will be limited as several issues
need to be resolved  a) utilities and infrastructure  b) access to pure water c)
extraction diculties in high altitude and d) SOE ownership in mining rights
Tianqi exhibits a superior gross margin at 70% vs other industry players due to
a) in-house high quality spodumene supply from the Greenbushes mine b) high
c) onshore lithium pricing premium at RMB10-20kt in China due to strong end
to the stability and performance of lithium batteries Tianqi believes lithium
be the major beneciaries riding the EV tide
Kwinana expansion in Western Australia to fuel production volume growth till
production by YE18 with spodumene ore grading at 24% with the utilization rate
in 24 months Another 24ktpa lithium hydroxide plant in Kwinana phase 2 is
17% Coupled with the 20ktpa lithium carbonate capacity addition in Suining

positions) and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors The sensitivity of xed-
construction  lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track The choice of
the proper xing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets where oating coupon rates (ie coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for xed coupons Funding in a currency that diers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
