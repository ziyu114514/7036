UpDownside
4Q21 net profits came in at RMB761mn up 3% YoY and was slightly below our
estimate on higher-than-expected promotional expense for the Winter Olympics
Raw milk appeared to be a smaller drag to the quarters GPM which came in
slightly higher YoY at c28% Overall 2021 is reported on track with Yilis guidance
achieving 18% recurring net profit growth with NPM expansion of 05pp
Meanwhile 1Q22 results kicked in line with our estimate at a 13% revenue growth
albeit any pandemic-driven lockdowns Along with the announcement Yili also
guided for a RMB1296bn 122bn revenue profits before tax targets for 2022E
and these imply 172% 208% YoY growth respectively The targets take into
account in our view the impact from Ausnutria consolidation starting from 2Q22
(previously recognized as JCE) after Yili raised its stake in the former to 5917%
since mid-March Excluding the event we estimate 2022E core revenue growth
to be c10% which is c3% below our previous forecasts Despite this we raise
our 2022E revenue by 3% to reflect the net impact of the above and hence our
slightly higher net profits estimates We are buy-rated Our new TP is still based
on 285x (unchanged) end-22E PE which represents 1sd above its 3-year
Highlights from management call
 Revenue net profit came in at RMB1106bn RMB87bn in 2021 14% 23%
YoY and continued to top the league among dairy firms in Asia Volume
increase sales mix upgrade and price increases or reduced promotions on
certain SKUs contributed 75% 38% and 25% to revenue growth
respectively which also drove 05ppt improvement YoY in GPM to 303%
 All main segments including liquid milk milk powder and products frozen
dairy recorded DDG at 115% 258% 163% YoY respectively

terms of growth achieving 40% market share the No1 in the industry

1Q22 in line management guidance implies
c10% 2022E core revenue growth
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE
 Targets and outlook Management targeted to achieve 9-10% NPM by 2025E and
large upside in Chinas dairy market given 25kg annual per capita milk consumption
 Management was positive on liquid milk especially higher-end SKUs which would
be driven by consumption upgrade and penetration into lower-tier cities in China
 Milk powder could accelerate as management expected birth rate to rebound on
fading Covid impact and favorable birth policies that China has been issuing
Management was confident to maintain steady growth and market share expansion
in the segment in 2022E
 Cheese could embrace its prime age in the next 3-5 years given a still large space
for product differentiation channel expansion and consumer education in the
Chinese market
 Covid impact The negative impact from outbreaks and lockdowns since Mar in several
important regional markets such as Shanghai was mainly on the efficiency of logistics
and deliveries while the supply guarantee policies in different cities under lockdowns
could even result to be favorable for such industry leader as Yili which was preferred
by local governments or consumers when choosing the products for the guarantee of
daily necessities
 Raw milk price was expected to remain overall stable in 2022E as demand-supply
was likely to remain in balance for the year according to management In longer term
raw milk price may still trend up on expected increasing demand for dairy products but
a dramatic uptick was unlikely as the government has been issuing favorable policy for
dairy upper stream to boost raw milk production which though should be better aligned
with downstream need in the future as the industry was expected to be increasingly
consolidated
