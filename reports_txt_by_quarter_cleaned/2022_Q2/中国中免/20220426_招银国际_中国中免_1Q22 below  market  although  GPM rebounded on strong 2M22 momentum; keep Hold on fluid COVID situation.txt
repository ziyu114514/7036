1Q net profits came in at RMB 256bn down 10% YoY and was slightly
below market consensus considering the result only tracked c22% of
consensus FY estimate CTGDF previously announced RMB 24bn net
profits for Jan-Feb This implies net profits for March was only RMB160mn
We believe this was mainly attributable to Hainans operation closure in
Despite the soft performance of March gross margins improved to 34% in
discount after management pledged to adhere to more disciplined
the known unknown to us especially when the supply chain of Sunrise
Shanghais online business was unexpectedly disrupted by the citys
lockdown We will keep watching the trajectory
Trading at -2SD below average earnings cut looks to be the major event to
drive share price performance from here Our 2022 forecast is still c6%
below consensus after trimming 3% of our 2022E net profits to reflect the 1Q
results Our new TP of RMB192 (from RMB212) is based on an updated 34x
(from 365) end-22E PE which still represents -1sd below 3-year average
Key highlights from management call
Covid impact was overall under control in Hainan so far according to
management while a major uncertainty for the business is the covid
situation and policy in other regions in China such as Shanghai
Key expansion project the Haikou International Duty Free City has its
construction phase which however has to be suspended due to difficulty
for construction teams to travel to Hainan from Shanghai given the citys
current lockdowns The target opening of the City though remained Sep 30
2022 as previously planned
Online business development an integrated online platform connecting online
and offline domestic and overseas and duty-free and taxed businesses has been
established which is endowed with a potential customer portfolio made of c22mn
