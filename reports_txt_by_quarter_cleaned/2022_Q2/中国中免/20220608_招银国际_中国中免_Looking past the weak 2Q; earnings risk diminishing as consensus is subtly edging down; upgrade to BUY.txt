We believe the worst for CTGDF is likely over upon signs of re-opening in
Shanghai from June onwards and the gradual rollout of pro-growth policies While
domestic travelling in our view might not stand at the forefront to see immediate
benefits from the re-opening expectation of travel resumption has been building
up towards 3Q with reference to the cases over past few years From here we
see scope for travelling demand to recover sequentially into 4Q particularly when
the quarter is seasonally clustered with festivals and shopping campaigns that
catalyze leisure spending Earnings-wise 2Q should look dismal given a c90%
decline in airport traffic to Shanghai Airport and that to Hainan in our view
unlikely to look significantly better City-wise lockdown could also represent a
temporary hiccup in delivery logistics for online sales That said our channel
check suggested that margins have been holding relatively well during 51 as
contrasted to our previous expectation that underpinned our HOLD rating
Consider also when consensus gradually edges towards our below-market
estimates (we were 6% below) CTGDFs risk-reward is turning more favorable
being priced-in and we upgraded CTGDF to BUY with a higher TP of RMB232
(from RMB192)
Earnings revisions We cut our 2022E revenue by c17% as a result of 1)
a 19% cut in 2022E revenue of Shanghai Airport Sunrise and 2) an 18%
cut in 2022E Hainan offshore duty-free related revenue which now stands at
RMB67bn (from RMB81bn) Separately we raised our 202223E GPM by
1513pp These in aggregate explain a 12% cut in our 2022E net profits
We are still c6% below consensus
Hainans duty-free related sales target We also lowered our forecast from
the official RMB100bn to RMB80bn based on an 80% market share (2021
c90%) that CTGDF could achieve on the island
Valuation Our new TP is now based on 465x (up from 340x) end-22E PE
which represents 2-year average (up from -1sd below average) since mid-
2020 We raise our target multiple to reflect the potential and imminent re-
rating which will likely be fueled by the sequentially recovering though
bumpy domestic tourist traffic
