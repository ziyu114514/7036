 1Q22 earnings largely inline Tigermed reported 1Q22 revenue of
RMB1818mn up 102% YoY accounting for 26% of our full-year estimate
full-year estimate By segment revenue of Clinical Trial Solution (CTS)
jumped by c150% YoY in 1Q22 thanks to the Companys active involvement
in COVID-19 MRCTs (multi-regional clinical trials) and strong clinical demand
from innovative drugs and medical devices Excluding COVID-19 related
improved from 376% in 4Q21 to 388% in 1Q22 due to milder RMB
appreciation in the quarter as well as fast revenue growth of high-margin
services such as data management and statistics analysis (DMSA) and lab
services Considering the shrinking size of pass-through fees from COVID-19
related revenue and the possible trend of RMB depreciation we expect
Tigermeds GPM to continue to improve in the rest of 2022 In 1Q22 non-
COVID-19 related new orders increased by c50% YoY serving as a solid
driver for Tigermeds future growth
 Omicron outbreaks in China had limited impact on business operation
Tigermed conducts clinical trial services in 2418 clinical centers (or hospitals)
in China with 66 centers in Shanghai and 35 in Changchun Shanghai and
centers in China In addition Shanghai and Changchun contributed c 67%
of Tigermeds total number enrollment in April Tigermed has adopted a series
of actions to insure the smooth operation of clinical trials In April only c 500
out of the 12000 enrolled patients missed clinical follow-ups while many of
the 500 patients continued their treatment As for lab services business
Shanghai contributes less than 20% of Tigermeds total lab service revenue
indicating limited impact on the overall growth of lab services Management
aims to achieve above 40% YoY recurring net profit growth in 2022E
assuming the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai would ease by the end of April
 Focus on high-margin business Management aims to prioritize the
expansion of high-margin businesses such as clinical trials operation and
DMSA while takes a conservative strategy on the SMO business given its low
profitability nature Tigermed is also actively exploring business opportunities
with MNC clients in China and in the Great Bay Area and Boston in the US
