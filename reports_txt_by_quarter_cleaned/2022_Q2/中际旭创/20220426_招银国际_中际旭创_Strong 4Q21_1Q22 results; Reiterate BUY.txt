YoY to RMB77bnRMB877mn 1Q22s revenueNP grew 419%634% YoY to
RMB21bnRMB217mn We think the results are solid and largely in-line with our

Innolights solid 4Q211Q22 results are largely within our expectations
FY21 revenue was 1% lower than our previous estimate and net profit to
shareholders was 3% higher than our estimate 1Q22 revenueNP
accounted for 21%20% of our full year forecasts We expect 2Q22-4Q22
sales will deliver steady QoQ growth following a similar trend as in 2021
GPM improved to 281% in 4Q21 from 245% in Q3 mainly due to favorable
product mix as hyperscale CSPs are ramping up the deployments for
200G400G optical modules However GPM in 1Q22 dropped to 263% as
domestic partial lockdown
Outlook remains positive given the demand from overseas Cloud
Amazon Meta and Microsoft all posted record Capex and guided very
positive budgets for this year to support their cloud services and AI-related
businesses We maintain our positive outlook for Innolight According to
Omdia Innolight had taken up 12% market share in the optical transceiver
market (ranked No 2) The Company has gained the most share among the
top 10 players mainly driven by the increasing sales of its 200G and 400G
optical module products
Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB456 We maintain BUY and
keep our target price at RMB456 Potential risks include weaker capex from
