We hosted a conference call with Innolight mgmt after market close yesterday
The stock price declined 49% yesterday possibly due to investors fear over
media report about potential capex cut from key client (although news on Twitter
clearly stated order cut was over VRAR devices) During the call Innolight
reaffirmed the orders for optical transceivers from overseas clients remain
unchanged This matches with the conclusions from our recent expert call (link)
steady for 2022 We maintain BUY rating with TP of RMB456
 Market concerns over potential capex cut from overseas cloud
very opportunistic capex outlook 1Q22 cloud capex continued to grow at
294% YoY Googles 1Q22 capex grew the most among the four cloud
to invest aggressively in 2022 Meta expected its 2022 capex to be in the
range of US29-34bn unchanged from prior estimate Microsoft expected a
sequential increase in capex as the Company continues to make investments
so as to meet growing global demand for its cloud services However
lower their budgeted capex considering tough macros Amazon has indicated
overcapacity earlier and planned to lower operations capital expenditures for
2022 (mainly to offset previous aggressively built fulfillment centers etc)
based on the following reasons 1) We should note that Amazons allocation
to infrastructure capex (primarily supporting AWS) will still grow from 40%
(TTM as of 1Q22) to 50% in FY22E 2) Datacenter infrastructure and AI-
related projects are likely among the last to cut given these businesses are
expected to outperform during tough economy The growth of AWSGoogle
cloudMicrosoft cloud was 366%438%26% YoY vs -18%230%184%
YoY for their total revenue in 1Q22 suggesting cloud business positively
contributed to their respective revenue growth
 Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB456 We believe Innolight is a major
beneficiary of cloud capex growth Maintain BUY Potential risks include
infrastructure and faster-than-expected tech advancement
