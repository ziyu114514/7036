Maxscend announced 1Q22 profit alert 1Q22 revenue is estimated to grow 124%
YoY to RMB1330mn while mid-point NP is expected to decline 79% YoY to
RMB454mn Given tough macro environment (unexpected geopolitical tension in
Euro partial lockdown in China) in addition to known weak smartphone demand
the Company delivered a satisfactory result in our view A double-digit revenue
growth for a tough quarter could dispel investors concerns over the Companys
capability to expand product portfolio Lower margin is well expected with product
portfolio expansion but the degree exceeded our previous estimate due to recent
supply chain uncertainties We lowered our bottom line forecasts and cut TP to
RMB278 Maintain BUY
 Revenue grew double-digit despite of high base and weak smartphone
shipment 1Q22 revenue is estimated to grow 124% YoY as RF module (L-
PAMiF) has been mass-produced Due to the unusual seasonality caused by
the pandemic 1Q21 was the best quarter during the year in terms of sales
Given the high base and recent weakness in smartphone market a double-
digit revenue growth for the first quarter should dispel investors concerns over
the Companys ability to continue to make breakthroughs in product
development and win clients orders
unexpected supply chain uncertainties 1Q22 NP is expected to decline
104% - 54% YoY due to 1) incremental RD fees for fab-lite program 2)
unfavorable product mix as product portfolio expanded into matured
categories such as sub-3GHz receiver modules 3) rising material price and
4) higher inventory level to ensure supply chain security
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB278 We lowered our FY22E NP by 9% due
to prolonged supply chain disruption We also adjusted target PE multiple to 37x
FY22E PE (vs prior 50x) 1-SD below historical 2-year average reflecting
smartphone market weakness margin pressure and supply chain uncertainties
3) slower-than-expected RD and 4) further deteriorated marco environment
Potential upside includes MA opportunity
