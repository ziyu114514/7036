8 May 2022
1Q22 was a beat thanks to better GP margin We highly appreciate Mideas shift
of focus to generate better than industrys growth in the next 3 years Therefore
we maintain BUY but fine-tuned TP to RMB 6779 based on 15x FY22E PE
(down from 22x) vs China Intl peers avg of 13x 14x
 FY21 results inline and 1Q22 results beat For FY21 sales net profit grew
by 20% 5% YoY 4%0% above BBG est while 1Q22 sales net profit
increased by 10% 11% 0%8% above BBG est For FY21 domestic
overseas sales growth were 25% 14% YoY and ToC ToB sales growth were
13% 39% YoY Within ToB business Industrial Technology Building
Technologies Digital Innovation Robotic  Automation sales growth were
44% 55% 51% 23% We find 1Q22 results impressive given the drag from
pandemics and the beat should be attributed to GPM improvement (05ppt
YoY to 222% in 1Q22) driven by ASP increases and better product mix We
are now more optimistic about GPM in FY22E driven by more raw material
hedging and CNY depreciation
 Aiming to optimize sales and improve margins in FY22E We believe
Midea maintains its guidance of 10% sales and 10% NP growth in FY22E
supported by its robust ToB sales growth and its focus on optimize sales and
improve margins We think the actual drivers are 1) premiumization where
COLMO sales could reach RMB 80bn (vs RMB 40bn in FY21 with 300%
YoY) 2) ramp up of overseas business as more than 600 Chinese
management are deployed in various regions since last year and entered into
 Beware of potential sector downturn and the shift to ToC businesses is
important Management is highly cautious about home appliances demand
driver which mainly consists of Building control Auto parts supply chain
Energy control and Automation businesses Sales accounted for 22% in FY21
and we expect to reach 30% by FY25E with a 17% sales CAGR during
FY21-25E For auto parts supply chain Midea has edges in drive system
thermal management system and auxiliary driving system It has secured
orders from Volkswagen and already touched base with Tesla For KUKA
business orders are extremely robust as Midea had entered BYD CATL and
Apples supply chain and we expect it to deliver sales volume of 30K 50K-
60K in FY22E 23E (vs about 20K at the time of acquisition)
 Maintain BUY but cut TP to RMB 6779 (16% upside) We reiterate BUY
and cut FY22E 23E NP by 7% 6% to factor in a weaker GP margin Our new
TP is based on 15x FY22E PE (down from 22x due to sector downturn) It is
now trading at 13x 22E PE (vs China overseas peers avg of 13x 14x)
