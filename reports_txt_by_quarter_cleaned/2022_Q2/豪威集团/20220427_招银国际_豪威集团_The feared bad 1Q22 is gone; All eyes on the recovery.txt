Willsemi announced 1Q22 results 1Q22 revenueNP to shareholders declined
108%139% YoY to RMB5583mnRMB896mn which accounted for 20%18%
of our full year forecasts The Company expected NP to shareholders will have
50% QoQ growth in 2Q22 driven by products structure adjustments and market
recovery Although we remain positive on Willsemis long-term outlook we expect
short-term performance is challenging under current market environment
Maintain BUY with reduced TP of RMB2000
 1Q22 results missed estimates Although our previous forecasts were more
conservative than consensus 1Q22 results still missed expectations Despite
another satisfactory quarter of non-mobile CIS growth 1Q22s revenue
dropped 108% YoY Mgmt attributed the decline to 1) further weakness in
smartphone shipment and 2) lowered semi distribution sales due to logistic
disruptions GPM dropped 12% to 353% in 1Q22 (vs 365% in 4Q21)
impacted by clients pricing strategy under share gain pressure
 High level of inventories raised investors concerns The Companys
inventories level was equal to 46x monthly sales in 4Q21 and further
increased to 57x in 1Q22 The mgmt have made clear that most of the
inventories are standard products and will not have higher asset impairment
risk However such level of inventory balance has surely caused market
concerns especially under current market sentiment In addition the
resurgence of COVID cases and partial lockdown measures may require the
Company to excessively build up inventories to secure productions adding
difficulty to offload inventories in near-term
 Tough market environment challenges Company performance Although
we remain positive on Willsemis long-term outlook we expect short-term
performance to be challenging By segment we expect the growth in non-
mobile CIS to remain largely intact 1Q22 non-mobile CIS is estimated to grow
70% YoY while full year growth is forecasted at 361% However we have
cut our expectations for mobile CIS sales given lowered smartphone
shipment projection Sales from mobile CIS is expected to decline 35% YoY
in 2022 vs previous forecast of 10% growth
 Maintain BUY with TP of RMB2000 We lowered our TP to RMB200 based
on 35x FY22E PE multiple (vs prior 42x) given depressed market sentiment
and weakened consumer confidence Potential downside risks include 1)
worse-than-expected global economy that curbs consumer spending 2)
higher level of inventory and 3) possible disruption in logistic and production
