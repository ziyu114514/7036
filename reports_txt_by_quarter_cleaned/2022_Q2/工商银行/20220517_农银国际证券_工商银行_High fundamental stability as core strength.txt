Analyst  Johannes Au
Lower risk buffers to increase earnings To raise support for the real economy the
government encourages big banks to reduce risk buffers based on an announcement on
Apr 13 2022 So far the said request has not been mandatory but we believe major
banks including ICBC would take steps to fulfill its social responsibility As such we
factor in a -2% CAGR in the banks provision expenses over FY21-24E which would
gradually reduce the banks provisioning ratio and provision coverage ratio to 278% and
18784% by end-24E Nevertheless in view of rising asset quality risk from the property
sector we project the banks NPL ratio to inch up by 1bps-3bps YoY each in FY22E-24E
and reach 148% by FY24E assuming the scale of NPL handling remains similar
China would once again elevate NIM pressure in banks Despite declining deposit rates
we expect loan re-pricing would delay the impact of interest rate cut by a few quarters we
forecast ICBCs NIM to narrow by 2bps-5bps YoY each in FY22E-24E to 202% by FY24E
In our opinion its robust total assets and total liabilities CAGRs at 60% and 58% in
FY21-24E would defend the bank against NIM pressure and support NII CAGR at 53% in
expenses at 3% of its topline revenue we anticipate CIR to rise mildly to 2929% by
2024E operating expenses would increase at 112% CAGR over FY21-24E

Maintain BUY on high fundamental stability ICBCs defensiveness against policy and
macro changes has been consistently proven The bank is one of our long-term core
holdings in the sector Leveraging its market-leading position we believe the bank
would continue to show consistent fundamental strength We adjust our HA TPs by -09%
and 09% to HK 745 and RMB 770 by assuming (1) topline and net profit CAGRs at
63% and 68% in FY21-24E (2) a higher sustainable ROAE (3) a higher long-term
growth rate (4) a lower equity risk premium (ERP)The TPs imply 073x087x target

Risk Factors 1) Radical change in business environment induced by heavy-handed
supervision and policies 2) Potential asset quality deterioration in specific sectors and
geographical areas 3) Rising CIR on technology development 4) Elevating NIM pressure
amid interest rate cut cycle 5) Resurgence or prolonged COVID-19 pandemic
