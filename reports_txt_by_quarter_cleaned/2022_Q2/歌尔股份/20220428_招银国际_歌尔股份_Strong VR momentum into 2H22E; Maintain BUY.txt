UpDownside
Goertek posted strong 1Q22 revenuerecurring NP growth of 43%46% YoY in-
line with its preliminary results mainly driven by 125% YoY growth in smart
product segment such as VR (Quest 2) and gaming console (PS 5) in our view
Also Goertek released upbeat 1H22 profit alert of 20-40% YoY growth which
implies 2Q22 NP of RMB118-152bn up 54-99% YoY Looking into 2H22E we
believe Goertek growth momentum will continue with multiple product launches
from new-gen AirPods Quest 2 Pro and PS VR2 Overall we expect Goerteks
earnings to grow 33%21% in FY2223E backed by 62%26% growth in smart
product segment (VR gaming console smart watch) We believe recent pullback
provides good buying opportunity (177x FY22E PE) given its solid product
roadmap and high earnings visibility in ARVR and gaming console biz Maintain
BUY and raised TP to RMB480 based on rollover 28x FY22E PE (7-yr hist avg)
 Strong 1Q22 on strong VR and gaming console product cycle Goertek
reported solid 1Q22 results with revenuerecurring NP of RMB201bn 878mn
up 43%46% YoY in-line with its preview earlier We attribute it to 1) AirPods
recovery with product launch in 2H21 2) stronger VR products (Oculus Quest
pre-announced net profit of RMB208-242bn up 20-40% YoY implying 2Q22
NP growth of 59-99% YoY with mid-point 33% above consensus estimate
We think the profit alert alleviated market concerns on AirPods weakness
COVID-19 impact and VR momentum in 2022
 2022 Outlook ARVR and gaming console as dual growth engines We
estimate AirPods shipment will rebound with 13%6% YoY to 88mn93mn in
FY2223E and Goertek will maintain at 43% share allocation In addition we
(51% of FY22E sales) which will grow at 62%26% YoY in FY2223E backed
by new product cycle from Oculus Quest 2 Pro and Sony PS VR 2 in 2H22E
as well as share gain in Sony PS 5
 Reiterate BUY and raised TP to RMB480 We revised up our FY22-23E EPS
to reflect upbeat 1H22 outlook and stronger momentum in VRgaming console
Our new TP of RMB480 is based on rollover 28x FY22E PE (vs prior 35x
FY21E PE) based on 7-year hist avg PE We believe recent correction
offers good opportunity to accumulate the stock
