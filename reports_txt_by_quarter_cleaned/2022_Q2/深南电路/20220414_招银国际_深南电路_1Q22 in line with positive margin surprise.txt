Shennan Circuits announced 1Q22 results RevenueNP grew 217%429%
YoY reaching RMB3316mnRMB348mn 1Q22s results was largely in line with
our forecast with positive margin surprise Looking forward we remain cautious
due to tough macro environment and recent resurgence of COVID cases in China
Although the latter has limited impact on Shennans production the demand
uncertainty remains as supply chain disruption is expected to last longer Maintain
HOLD adjusted TP to RMB102
 1Q22 results largely in line with positive margin surprise 1Q22s revenue
was largely in line with our forecast accounting for 201% of our FY21
estimate (vs 195% for 1Q21) GPM was 268% 43% higher than 4Q21
mainly due to 1) favorable product mix 2) recovering GPM for PCBA 3)
improving operational efficiency as new Nantong factory ramping up
production and 4) productcustomer structure optimization for PCB and
substrate business
 Recent partial lockdown has limited impact on production but demand
uncertainty remains Resurgent COVID cases in China has limited impact
on production as some factories are currently under closed loop system
management However the impact on demand and supply chain is expected
to last longer We believe datacenterauto demand will remain strong this year
remains weak at the moment According to Telcos latest filings 670k 5G
base stations (including 28k 700MHz) will be added in 2022 (vs 650k640k in
20212020) Overall capex will be flat in 2022 however 5G-related spending
will be lower and detailed timeline of deployment is unclear
 Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB102 We expect FY22 revenue to grow
183% YoY supported by new capacity released this year and strong demand
for datacenterautosubstrate However uncertainty will remain longer-than-
expected as supply chain disruption persists We trimmed target PE multiple
to 262x FY22E PE avg 2-yr historical forward PE (vs prior 30x) and
reduced TP to RMB102 Potential upside 1) sooner-than-expected ease of
chip shortage 2) stronger recovery in consumer demand and 3) material cost
and logistic overhang removed
