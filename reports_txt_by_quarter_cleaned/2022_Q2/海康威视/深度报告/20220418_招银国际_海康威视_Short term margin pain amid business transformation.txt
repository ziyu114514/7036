UpDownside
Hikvision top-line remained strong but GPM erosion was a negative surprise in
FY21  FY1Q22 due to 1) more implementation work of large-scale smart city
projects 2) increasing innovative business contribution and 3) additional costs
due to supply chain disruption However we are encouraged to see reducing
reliance on public security projects Margin decline is a temporary yet inevitable
short term pain amid business transformation in our view Maintain BUY
 FY1Q21 top-line beat but margin miss Hikvision reported in-line FY21 with
revenue of RMB8142bn (28% YoY) and net profit of RMB1680bn (26%
YoY) However GPM missed (-22 ppts YoY to 443%) as more low-margin
implementation work was performed in FY4Q21 (FY4Q21 GPM 400% -42
pct pts YoY) FY1Q22 revenue growth remained strong at 18% YoY to
RMB1652bn but net profit missed (merely 5% YoY to RMB228bn) largely
due to unexpected GPM erosion (-31 pct pts YoY to 437%)
 Innovative business revenue doubled YoY in FY21 With continuous RD
effort (RD expense was up 29% YoY to RMB825bn in FY21) Hikvision has
expanded its camera applications with AI sensors technology Innovative
businesses (Smart Home Robotics Thermal HikAuto Storage etc) revenue
doubled YoY to RMB1227bn accounting for 15% of FY21 revenue (vs 10%
in FY20) Core surveillance business also recorded strong recovery from
COVID-19 (206% YoY to RMB6915bn in FY21) Meanwhile we are
encouraged to see lower reliance on public security projects as PBG China
revenue contribution continued to decline (32% in FY21 vs 35% in FY20)
 Targets stable FY22E GPM despite mix change Hikvision FY21  FY1Q22
GPM erosion was a negative surprise The decline was attributable to 1) local
government specifically appointing Hikvision to be the system integrator of
large-scale Smart City projects (Construction GPM was low at 230% vs Core
products of 464%) 2) increasing innovative business contribution (GPM
improved to 405% in FY21 from 373% in FY20 but still below blended GPM)
and 3) additional raw materials logistics cost caused by supply chain
disruption Hikvision will continue its high-inventory strategy and targets to
maintain a stable GPM in FY22E despite revenue mix change
 Maintain BUY We cut FY21-23E net profit by 6-7% to reflect lower gross
margin Maintain BUY with new target price of RMB5710 (prior RMB6206)
Key downside risks include city-lockdowns and softening macro
