CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
OmniVision (603501 CH)
Solid 1H25 results Maintain BUY
OmniVision reported 1H25 results 1H revenue rose 15% YoY to RMB140bn
led by double-digit growth in Analog Solutions (21% YoY) and Distribution
(42% YoY) During the period gross margin remained stable at 305% (13 ppts
YoY) while net profit surged by 48% YoY to RMB20bn NPM improved to 145%
(from 113% in 1H24) reflecting operating leverage and cost control The sales
of OVs core business CIS reached a record RMB103bn (11% YoY) with auto
security emerging IoT and medical CIS growing 30% 17% 249% and 68%
YoY respectively offsetting weakness in mobile CIS (-19% YoY) We believe
OmniVision is well-positioned in the CIS market with leading market share in auto
CIS medical CIS etc We forecast its revenue to grow at 18%25% YoY in
202526E while NP to increase by 24%50% YoY Maintain BUY with TP of
 Auto CIS remained a key growth pillar accounting for 37% of segment
sales with revenue of RMB38bn (30% YoY) The growth was fueled by
ADAS penetration and cabin imaging demand With a 30% global market
share (per TechInsights) and tailwinds from Chinas intelligent driving
equality policy we expect OVs auto CIS sales to grow at 40% YoY in both
2025E and 2026E
 Mobile CIS faced headwinds in 1H (-19% YoY) due to cyclical demand
transition (end-of-cycle demand for OV50H EOL) and slow smartphone
recovery in China (domestic shipment grew 33% YoY in 1Q25 on
government subsidies but decreased 4%4% YoYQoQ in 2Q as demand fell)
We expect a seasonal pickup in 2H but project full-year mobile CIS
revenue to decline 15% YoY as the headwinds persist (2025 smartphone
shipment to grow by a merely 06%19% YoY per IDCCounterpoint)
Growth should resume in 2026E with design-wins in 200MP sensors and
new product cycles
 Emerging IoT and Medical CIS showed explosive growth while security
demand gradually recovers Emerging IoT revenue surged by 249% YoY
to RMB12bn in 1H25 driven by sports cameras XR and machine vision
Medical CIS rose 68% YoY to RMB443mn Security CIS grew by 17% YoY to
RMB827mn due to rising adoption of its high-end products (Nyxel tech) and
market recovery We expect Emerging IoT and Medical CIS to maintain
significant growth at 230%50% YoY in 2025E
 Maintain BUY with TP of RMB173 based on 336x 2026E PE (in-line with
historical 2-year average) Previous TP was RMB176 (41x 2025E PE) We
cut 202526E net profit forecasts by 19%15% on slower mobile CIS ramp
and GPM headwinds from mix shift (greater distribution sales contribution)
We remain optimistic on OV with 50% YoY profit growth projection for 2026E
considering new mobile CIS product ramp-up and margin improvement Key
