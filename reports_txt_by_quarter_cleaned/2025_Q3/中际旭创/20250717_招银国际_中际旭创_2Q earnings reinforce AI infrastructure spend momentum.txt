CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Innolight (300308 CH)
2Q earnings reinforce AI infrastructure spend
Innolight announced 1H25 preliminary earnings 1H25 NP is guided to be
RMB36bn-RMB44bn up 53%-87% YoY 2Q NP alone is estimated to be
RMB20bn-RMB28bn up 50%-107% YoY27%-78% QoQ 2Q NP beat
strong results were driven by 1) robust topline growth on sustained AI demand
(report) and 2) margin increases due to a favorable product mix (higher
contribution from 800G and silicon photonics products) and yield improvement
Reiterate BUY with TP raised to RMB225
 Sequential revenue growth in recent quarters driven by robust AI
infrastructure spend Innolights revenue grew by 38% YoY2% QoQ in 1Q
We expect 2Q NP to grow QoQ again driven by 1) strong capex from
overseas CSPs and new entrants 2) strong demand for 400G800G
transceivers from ASICEthernet datacenter needs By data rate revenue
contribution from 800GSiPh products continues to grow Looking ahead
mgmt expects AI-driven demand to remain elevated through 2026 with 800G
volumes continuing to rise and 16T adoption accelerating We noticed that
Eoptolink (300502 CH NR) also preannounced significant 2Q NP growth of
293%-386% YoY35%-67% QoQ In addition FII (601138 CH NR) pre-
announced 2Q NP growth of 48%-52% YoY29%-32% QoQ FIIs mgmt
highlighted that AI server sales growth exceeded 60% YoY in 2Q and 800G
switch sales alone nearly tripled full-year sales in 2024 BBG consensus
forecasts major overseas hyperscalers (MSFTAMZNGOOGMETA) capex
to grow by 43% YoY and domestic Big Threes (AlibabaTencentBaidu)
capex to grow by 44% YoY in 2025E As a key beneficiary riding the AI
tailwind we forecast Innolights revenue to increase by 525% in 2025E
 Further margin expansion on favourable product mix and better yields
With higher 800G sales and incremental contribution from 16T we expect
Innolights
(3Q244Q241Q25 336%351%367%) SiPh demand is growing offsetting
the impact of EML shortage and contributing to GPM Innolight will provide
SiPh solutions for 16T products as well per mgmt and we estimate NPM to
reach a historical high in 2Q while remaining at a high level going forward
(vs prev 353%) due to better-than-expected GPM in 2Q We have also
revised up 2025E NP to RMB92bn (77% YoY vs prev 49% YoY)
 Reiterate BUY with TP raised to RMB225 based on 27x 2025E PE
(peers avg 2025E PE is 281x) close to 05SD above its 5-yr avg hist
forward PE (218x) We have raised our revenueNP growth forecasts to
525%773% YoY in 2025 on 1) higher 800G shipment volume 2) milder
annual ASP adjustments and 3) an enhanced GPM We lift our target PE to
27x vs prior 215x given little impact from earlier tariffs Key risks include
slower-than-expected shipments geopolitical uncertainties supply chain
shortage etc
