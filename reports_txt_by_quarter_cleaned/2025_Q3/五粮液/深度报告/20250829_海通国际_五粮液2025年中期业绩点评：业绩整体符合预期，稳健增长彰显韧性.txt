事件。公司发布2025 年半年报：25H1 公司实现营业总收入5277
亿元，同比42%，归母净利润1949 亿元，同比23%；其中Q2
单季实现营业总收入1583 亿元，同比01%，归母净利润463 亿
元，同比-76%，利润慢于营收主要系税费影响所致。
量增价缓特征显著，东部市场增速亮眼。分产品：25H1 五粮液产
品收入同比46%（其中量127%，价-72%），量增主因1618、
39 度低度酒宴席场景增长显著；主品牌吨价下滑主因经销库存消
化及直销占比提升。25H1 其他酒收入同比27%（其中量588%，
价-353%），中低价位产品放量明显；低端产品放量及渠道促销拉
升系列酒吨价降幅。分区域：25H1 东部大本营市场收入快速增
长，同比79%，我们认为或与报告期内前五大经销商销售收入占
比同比大幅提升有关；南部、北部大本营市场增长稳健，收入同
比19%18%。
25Q2 盈利能力小幅下滑，资金周转效率显著提升。25H125Q2 毛
利率同比-05pct-03pct，主因其他酒毛利率下滑较多（25H1 同比
-15pct）；25H125Q2 归母净利率同比-07pct-24pct，其中，
25Q2 销售管理期间费用率同比15pct0pct22pct；主营税金
率同比09pct 及毛利率下降为净利率同比下滑主要原因。25Q2 合
同负债1008 亿元，环比-09 亿元；同期销售收现3123 亿元，同
比120%；25Q2 末应收款项融资回落至389 亿元，现金回款比例
和回款质量得到显著提升。
25 年紧扣核心战略定位，三大维度应对行业调整。25H1 公司紧扣
营销执行提升年总定位，持续巩固五粮液品牌市场地位，顺利实
现双过半目标。25 年通过渠道改革、产品创新和市场布局三大
维度应对行业调整：渠道结构优化，精简经销商网络数量；产品
年轻化战略，推出低度新品；加速国际化布局，推出本土化创新
产品，营销管理持续优化。
盈利预测与投资建议：当前白酒行业仍处于寻底阶段，公司以营
销创新与产能升级应对行业调整，稳健增长彰显经营韧性。鉴于
Q2 吨价有所走弱，我们小幅下修盈利预期。我们预计2025-2027
年公司收入为9179581011 亿元，归母净利润分别为320337359
亿元，对应EPS 分别为828793 元（前值为869093 元）。参
考可比公司估值水平，我们维持公司20xPE，目标价由172 下调至
164 元，维持优于大市评级。

Volume growth outpaced price increases with the eastern market showing particularly strong growth By product Wuliangyes
revenue in 25H1 rose 46% YoY (volume 127% price -72%) Volume growth was primarily driven by significant expansion in
banquet scenarios for the 1618 and 39-degree low-alcohol products The decline in tonnage price for the main brand stemmed
mainly from distributor inventory digestion and increased direct sales Revenue from other liquor products rose 27% YoY in 25H1
(volume 588% price -353%) driven by substantial volume growth in mid-to-low-end offerings Volume expansion in low-end
products and channel promotions contributed to the decline in tonnage price for series liquor Regional Breakdown Revenue in
the Eastern stronghold market grew rapidly in 25H1 up 79% YoY We consider this may be related to a significant YoY increase in

Profitability declined slightly in Q2 2025 while capital turnover efficiency improved significantly Gross margin decreased by 05
percentage points year-on-year in H1 2025 and by 03 percentage points in Q2 2025 primarily due to a more pronounced decline

attributable to shareholders decreased by 07 percentage points year-on-year in 25H1 and by 24 percentage points in 25Q2
Specifically salesadministrativeperiod expenses ratios increased by 15 percentage points 0 percentage points and 22

in the main business tax rate and the decrease in gross profit margin Contract liabilities stood at RMB 1008 billion in 25Q2 down
RMB 009 billion quarter-on-quarter Cash collected from sales reached RMB 3123 billion up 120% year-on-year Financing of
accounts receivable declined to RMB 389 billion by the end of 25Q2 with both the proportion of cash collections and the quality

solidifying the Wuliangye brands market position and successfully achieving its double-half targets Throughout 2025 it
addressed industry adjustments through three key dimensions channel reform product innovation and market expansion This
included optimizing channel structure by streamlining the distributor network implementing a youth-oriented product strategy

continuously refining marketing management
consecutive years of steady improvement Wuliangye  series of baijiu products gross profit margin reached 870%  608%
respectively the product structure continues to optimize The decline of 2024 in the net profit margin of the mother is mainly due
to the increase in the market cost of the investment 2020-2023 net operating cash flow continued to grow in 2024 -372% year-
on-year mainly due to the reduction of dealer advances and the proportion of bill settlement changes 25Q1 operating cash flow
of 1585 billion yuan 29703% year-on-year mainly due to the higher proportion of cash collection in the quarterly payment and
the impact of a low base in the same period last year
