CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Shengyi Tech (600183 CH)
Strong 1H25 results underscore AI-driven
projected 1H25 NP to surge by 50%-56% YoY reaching RMB140bn-
RMB145bn 2Q NP alone is estimated to be RMB836mn-RMB886mn implying
55%-64% YoY48%-57% QoQ growth and exceeding Bloomberg consensus of
RMB611mn by 37%-45% The strong results were driven by 1) volume growth of
CCL products 2) surging PCB sales (85%-97% YoY in 1H25) and 3) GPM
increase from a favorable product mix Reiterate BUY on Shengyi Tech as the
is revised up to RMB411
subsidiary Shengyi Electronics (688183 CH NR) also released prelim 1H25
results projecting revenue growth of 85%-97% YoY to RMB37bn-
RMB39bn and NP growth of 432%-471% YoY to RMB511-549mn Shengyi
Electronics has showed sequential growth in 2Q Its latest quarterly sales
are estimated to be RMB21bn-RMB23bn showing 90%-111% YoY31%-
46% QoQ growth (following 5% QoQ growth in 1Q) 2Q NP is guided to be
RMB311mn-RMB349mn with 346%-401% YoY and 56%-75% QoQ
increases We believe that such strong performance is supported by resilient
AI-driven demand and further product mix enhancement which together
drove margin expansion and earnings acceleration
 Margin continues to improve which may offset the rising copper cost
headwinds Shengyi Techs mgmt sees GPM increase in its CCL business
driven by optimization in product structure In addition NPM of Shengyis
PCB segment continues to recover with mid-point NPM rising to 151% in
2Q25 vs 127%64% in 1Q252Q24 Meanwhile we have observed that
rising copper price appears to be headwinds to its PCB segment Copper
price remains at its high level at above US96ktonne during the month The
material cost pressure may sustain in our view primarily attributable to the
tariffs and growing demand from AIdata centers auto and etc However we
think Shengyi Elec will manage the impact as it focuses on high value
 Reiterate BUY with TP raised to RMB411 based on 30x 2025E PE (vs
306x prev) close to 1-SD above its 5-yr hist forward PE We raise our
revenueNP growth forecasts to 39%92% YoY in 2025 on higher volume
experiencing upcycle and robust growth (revenueNP to grow) Key risks
geopolitical uncertainties etc
