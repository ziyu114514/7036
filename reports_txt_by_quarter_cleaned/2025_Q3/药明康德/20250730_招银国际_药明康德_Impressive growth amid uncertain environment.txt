WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) -
Impressive growth amid
uncertain environment
Impressive growth amid uncertain environment
WuXi AppTec reported better-than-expected 1H25 results with revenue
increasing by 206% YoY (including 242% YoY growth for continuing operations)
and adj non-IFRS net profit surging by 444% YoY  Revenue from continuing
operations and adj non-IFRS net profit accounted for 475% and 544%
respectively of our full-year forecasts both higher than the historical ranges
WuXi AppTec delivered strong operational execution despite ongoing macro
uncertainties As such mgmt raised its full-year guidance for 2025 expecting
revenue of continuing operations to grow by 13-17% (vs prior guidance of 10-
15%) and adj non-IFRS net profit margin to expand in 2025
growth driver for the global CXO industry in the post-COVID era As a global
leader in the chemical drug CDMO sector WuXi AppTec has substantially
benefited from this trend In 1H25 its TIDES revenue surged by 1416% YoY
thanks to faster-than-expected manufacturing capacity ramp-up Mgmt raised
its full-year guidance for TIDEs revenue growth from 60% to 80% Revenue
from small molecule DM grew by 175% YoY marking a notable rebound
from the negative growth seen in 20232024 In addition the volatilities in US-
China tariffs seemed to have limited impact to the Companys first half
operation in our view Despite ongoing volatility in the global macro
manufacturing is likely to continue supporting the growth of leading CDMO
players like WuXi AppTec
 Expanding global capacity to support long-term growth As of end-1H25
WuXi AppTecs backlog impressively grew by 372% YoY with backlog of
TIDES increasing even more strongly at 488% YoY The mgmt reiterated
their plan to increase the Companys peptide capacity to over 100k liters by
projects and growing pipelines At the same time capacity expansion efforts
are underway at multiple sites including Changzhou (China) Singapore the
US and Switzerland WuXi AppTec has reaffirmed its capex target of RMB7
 Recovery in early-stage RD still takes time While revenue from early-
stage RD services showed sequential improvements in 1H25 over 2024
mgmt viewed that a meaningful recovery in early-stage RD demand will
take time Early-stage RD services contribute 30% of the Companys total
revenue The global biotech financing usually serves as an early indicator of
early-stage RD demand
 Maintain BUY We raise our DCF-based TP from RMB7722 to RMB11656
(WACC 942% terminal growth 200% both unchanged) to factor in the
upgraded guidance and the improved macro environment such as the US-
China tariff We now expect revenue from continuing operations to grow by
160% 159% 158% YoY and adjusted non-IFRS net profit to grow by
162% 176% 164% YoY in 2025E 26E 27E respectively
