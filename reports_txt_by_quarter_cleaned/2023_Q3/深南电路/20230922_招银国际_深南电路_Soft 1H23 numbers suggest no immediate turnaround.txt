Shennan Circuit (002916 CH)
Soft 1H23 numbers suggest no immediate
HOLD (Maintain)
The worldwide PCB market experienced a significant decline of 20% YoY
in 1H23 mainly due to falling demand for electronics products under global
macroeconomic pressure This is in line with our previous prediction that we
expect the global PCB market will persistently encounter macroeconomic
challenges due to weakened consumer demand and the ongoing destocking
cycle among downstream industries (link) Shennan Circuit (002916 CH) a
pure PCB manufacturer is not immune to the market weakness Maintain
HOLD with lowered TP of RMB72
 PCB segment (nearly 23 of total revenue) remains weak with margin
erosion in a declining market Segment revenue dropped by 124% YoY
and 116% QoQ to RMB39bn in 1H23 The gross margin declined by
dragged the segment sales The contribution of the Companys AI server
related PCB products was not meaningful suggesting Shennan is not yet a
key beneficiary from the current AI boom Auto PCB was the only spotlight
with 40% YoY growth in orders due to a low base
 Substrate segment was dealt a heavy blow with a significant 399% YoY
drop in revenue as downstream manufacturers continued destocking
Although the Company actively ventured into new projects and cultivated
new customer relationships ASP erosion was particularly severe for
package substrate GPM was 188% in 1H23 vs 303% and 231% in
1H222H22 affected by market down cycle and rising costs of new factories
 The Company reported a 135% YoY decline in revenue to RMB60bn and
a substantial 3702% YoY drop in net profit to RMB474mn in 1H23 GPM
was lowered to 229% vs 265% and 246% in 1H222H22 The Companys
1H23 results were below our estimates which were already lower than
consensus We cut FY2324E revenue and NP by 14%14% and 29%24%
as we think the business will continue to be affected by industry downcycle
and a near-term turnaround may not be imminent Maintain HOLD with
lowered TP of RMB72 based on 25x rollover 2024E PE We keep the
same PE multiple of 25x which is over 1SD below 5-year historical avg as
the market is waiting for a clear sign of demand recovery
