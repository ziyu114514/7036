rapid development of the solar market In recent years the National Energy Administration
issued a notice on solar power generation development proposing a series of policy
measures including increasing support for photovoltaic poverty alleviation promoting the
construction of solar power energy storage projects and accelerating the construction of
photovoltaic poverty alleviation demonstration power stations providing strong policy
guarantees for the development of the solar power industry
Overall the new energy power generation industry in China is in a phase of rapid
development with abundant resource reserves strong policy support continuous
technological improvement and broad market prospects
In the future wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation will continue to be
the main forms of new energy power generation At the same time to better promote the
development of new energy power generation it is also necessary to strengthen grid
construction and research on energy storage technologies and improve the consumption
capacity and stability of new energy power generation

latest Big Five and Small Noble 4 power generation groups Based on the data of 2022
we found that CTGR has several outstanding advantages as follows
1) In 2022 CTGRs photovoltaic installed capacity was the highest among the
listed peers of Big Five and Small Noble 4 power generation groups In the
future CTGR will continue to focus on developing photovoltaic installations
The target for the newly-added photovoltaic and wind power installed capacity of CTGR in
2023 is 5000 MW Photovoltaic installed capacity will make up the majority of this target
with a planned ratio of around 64 between photovoltaic and wind power Additionally the
upstream cost of the photovoltaic industry chain has decreased which has partially
reduced construction costs and helped to improve the overall IRR of photovoltaic projects
it to achieve or even exceed the photovoltaic installed capacity targets
Due to longer procurement cycles the installations in 1H23 were delayed It is expected
that new energy installation will accelerate in the 2H23
2)  In 2022 CTGRs power generation increased significantly which was due to
the increase in wind and solar power installations and higher-than-national-
average utilization hours
In 2022 CTGRs power generation increased by 462% YoY to 4835mn MWh which was
relatively optimistic In Jun 2023 CTGRs power generation had increased by 1471% to
2809bn kWh From Jan to May power generation and utilization hours were slightly higher
than the national average With the improvement of wind resources it is expected that wind
power generation will continue to improve

as well as good gross profit margin and net margin The related growth can be driven by 1)
CTGRs clear target for new installations in 2023 2)sufficient approved and reserved
projects 3) a significant decrease in upstream costs for photovoltaics and wind power 4)
a great incentive scheme
4) CTGRs installation progress in 1H23 was slightly slower and its stock price
has been stagnant with its valuation partially falling We expect its new
energy installations to accelerate in 2H23 and the stock price to rebound
In 2022 CTGR recorded a PE of 217x and a PB of 19x Its overall valuation was slightly
such as China Longyuan and Huaneng Renewables Therefore we regard CTGRs profit
announcement of Jun 2023 CTGRs progress in 1H23 is slightly slower and its stock price
has been stagnant with its valuation partially falling We expect installations to accelerate
in 2H23 and the stock price to rebound
5) CTGR is a leader in offshore wind power generation with advanced
technology and stable future development
As one of the earliest central enterprises to develop offshore wind power in China the
CTGR has nearly 5mn kW of offshore wind power capacity that is already connected to the
grid ranking first in China The large-scale development of offshore wind power is a
In addition CTGR has a number of offshore wind power projects in the pipeline and has
received support from the government for the development of offshore wind power We
believe that CTGRs leadership in offshore wind power generation will be beneficial to its
long-term development
Lower upstream costs lead to higher IRR of the wind farm
project and solar power project prompting CTGRs
investment willingness
The wind power industry in China has entered the Grid Parity Era since 2021 leading to a
reduction in upstream costs and a decline in wind turbine prices According to Wind Power
Headlines the highest price for onshore wind turbines reached RMB4200kW in mid-2020
and fell to the lowest at RMB1150kW in Feb 2023 dropping by -73% Therefore lower
upstream costs have resulted in an increase in the IRR of wind power projects making
more projects suitable for investment by CTGR As a result CTGR is expected to show a

Source Wind CMBIGM estimates
Figure 20 Onshore wind power tariff policies
Source NDRC CMBIGM estimates
The optimization of the industrial chain in the wind power sector reduces cost and increases
efficiency which drives the long-term growth in IRR of the onshore wind power project For
example if the average tariff (incl-tax) for the project is RMB045kWh the construction
cost of a 100MW onshore wind power project falls from RMB4500kWh to RMB4000kWh
the IRR of the project will increase from 11% to 143% Additionally if the construction cost
decreases further to RMB3800kWh the IRR will increase to 155%

Assuming utilization hours of 2000
As the IRR for wind farm projects increases thanks to lower upstream costs more projects
will meet CTGRs investment criteria IRR Therefore a higher IRR of the wind power project
is likely to boost CTGR Powers investment willingness in newly-added wind power
installations
For solar farm given the upstream cost continues to drop we believe the IRR of wind farm

of CTGRs focus on increasing photovoltaic installed capacity in 2023 we believe the
targets for 2023 As a result the new projects IRR of CTGR is expected to further increase
Figure 22 Sensitivity analysis of IRR (solar power project)
Source Company data CMBIGM estimates
Lower upstream costs in the short to medium term are expected to benefit the IRR of new
energy projects of CTGR Continuous technological progress may also create opportunities
for IRR improvement Otherwise changes in the non-technical costs of local governments
Additionally CTGRs accelerated deployment of wind and solar power installed capacity
as well as active deployment of energy storage is expected to benefit the stability of wind
and photovoltaic power generation However configuring energy storage may increase
construction costs and put some pressure on the projects IRR Therefore overall changes
The improvement of power generation and average utilization hours
Due to the rapid increase in wind power and solar installed capacity Chinas wind power
and solar power generation have grown significantly The average utilization hours of grid-
connected wind and solar power equipment showed an overall upward trend mainly due
to the significant improvement in the wind and solar power curtailment rate

Financial analysis and valuation
Better proportion of new energy subsidies to account receivable expected
CTGR provisions impairment of renewable energy subsidies under conservative
assumptions which affects current profit Accounts receivable for new energy subsidies
accounts for 928% of the total which show slight improvement The Company has set
aside RMB 560mn in bad debt reserves for subsidy receivables which may increase the
Companys net profit and operating cash flow if the subsidies are returned and the bad debt
provision is less than the book balance of the reserve
Figure 31 Proportion of new energy subsidies to accounts receivable (2017-2022)

Profit forecast key assumptions
annual wind and solar power installed capacity will increase by no less than 5mn kW
during the 14th Five-Year Plan period Based on the projects of the under-
construction and approved We expect that the total installed capacity in 2023-2025
will reach 31421MW 37421MW and 44221mn kW respectively

(2) Utilization hours Wind and solar resources are easily affected by climatic conditions
We assume that the utilization hours of onshore wind photovoltaic and hydropower
for the CTGR will be 2065 1348 and 4250 hours in 2023 We assume that the
utilization hours of onshore wind power will increase by 1% YoY in 2024 the
utilization hours of photovoltaic will up by 3% YoY and the utilization hours of
hydropower will remain unchanged
(3) Tariff We calculate the wind and solar power grid tariff for the Company in 2023-
2025 based on the weighted average price of subsidies and trading prices We
assume that the subsidy policies for wind and solar power will remain stable during
the forecast period and the proportion of subsidies in the grid price will gradually
decrease Overall we assume that the market electricity prices will remain stable
(4) Cost of generation We assume that the cost of wind and solar power generation
for the Company will continue to decrease due to technological advancement and
lower upstream costs For 2023 we estimate that the cost of wind power generation
will decrease by 4% YoY and the cost of solar power generation will decrease by 6%
(5) Revenue growth We assume that the Companys revenue CAGR will reach 168%
during the forecast period driven by the continuous expansion of installed capacity
and the improvement of grid parity

We estimate CTGRs net profit attributable to shareholders to be RMB97bn RMB1179bn
and RMB1444bn in 2023 2024 and 2025 respectively with EPS of RMB034 RMB041
and RMB050share
Currently CTGR is trading at 17x FY23E PE which was lower than its peer China
Longyuan (001289 CH) 22x FY23E PE  For CTGR its valuation was 2259x for FY22 PE
Thus we regard CTGRs valuation should be re-rated and close to its peer China
Longyuans valuation as they both are  the leading new energy operators with strong
For CTGR it has the growth potential in 2023 as follows 1) speed up new energy
installation as the higher IRR of the projects with lower upstream cost as we estimated
solar power newly-added capacity will up by 60%YoY to 3000MW and wind power newly-
added installed capacity will up by 21%YoY to 2000MW in 2023 2) robust on-grid tariff
management capability and active green power trading enable CTGR to stabilize its overall
on-grid tariff and we expected the on-grid tariff of 2023 will reach RMB05W 3) we also
predicted further lower upstream cost to boost the GPM from 58% in 2022 to 59%59%60%
in 2023-25E 4)continually stable and attractive dividend payout ratio
