CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
CTGR Group (600905 CH)
Sound business operation rising depreciation
CTGR Group announced its 1H23 results with in-line business operation but
operating cost missing expectations CTGR achieved revenue of RMB1370bn up
by 1298% YoY Attributable NP was RMB452bn dropped by 1010% YoY Although
CTGR reported solid operation in electricity generation and slightly beat on-grid tariff
the increase in costs and operating expenses (under updated accounting standards)
led to a drop in earnings We believe CTGR will grow rapidly since its abundant
projects under construction are about to operate in 2H23 and following years and
lower new energy upstream costs will lead to higher IRR of the projects  We
adjusted our TP to RMB624 and maintained a BUY rating
 Robust operational performance drives 1H23 revenue growth rising
operating costs erode overall earnings In 1H23 CTGRs revenue was up by
1298% YoY due to resilient power generation growth Attributable NP dropped by
10% YoY Its operating cash flow rose 2179% YoY CTGRs revenue rose while
attributable NP slipped due to 1) 1455% YoY rise in on-grid power generation 2)
slightly beat on-grid tariff for windsolar power of RMB04960506 kWh 3) 3467%
YoY increase in operating costs thanks to higher depreciation under accounting
standard change (the depreciation of project operation costs accrue as the units
enter operation in 2023 after a trial run in 2022) and higher management  fee and
4) 16% YoY rise in management expenses while investment earnings descended
by RMB027bn
 CTGR has abundant projects in construction and approved with expected
promising growth In 1H23 CTGR recorded a newly-added new energy installed
capacity of approximately 18GW (084065GW of windsolar power) Moreover
CTGR recorded an approved and filed project capacity of 55 GW and the planned
installed capacity of projects under construction totalled 132 GW With the projects
energy is expected to speed up Meanwhile CTGRs IRR of newly-added power
plant projects will potentially climb due to lower upstream costs benefiting CTGRs
 We adjusted our TP to RMB624 maintained BUY Considering accounting
standard adjustment we slightly raised our estimated operating cost to
RMB122191434416371mn in FY23-25E and adjusted attributable NP to
RMB89321053412956mn in FY23-25E However we maintained our key
assumptions unchanged and stayed optimistic about CTGR thanks to its solid
growth of power generation and steady on-grid tariff and several projects are about
to start operation Thus we raised our target FY23E PE from18x to 20x (close to
3-year hist avgPE of 19x) for its sound business outlook and we adjusted our TP
to RMB624 Maintain BUY
