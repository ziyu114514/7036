CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Zhejiang Jingsheng (300316 CH)
2Q23 net profit 73% YoY in line Arms race
still good for equipment makers
Zhejiang Jingsheng (JSG)s net profit in 1H23 surged 83% YoY to RMB22bn
in line with the pre-announced profit released in mid-Jul Net profit in 2Q23 grew
73% YoY to RMB13bn a record high As of end-Jun 23 total backlog reached
RMB278bn (solarsemiconductor 88%12%) which continues to offer visibility
2023E PE on the back of 32% earnings CAGR in 2023E-24E While the solar
sector has been under pressure we expect equipment makers will outperform
other segments in the supply chain due to the arms race to expand and upgrade
equipment and (2) spin-off of crucible business unit
 1H23 results Explosive growth of materials segment Revenue grew
92% YoY to RMB84bn in 1H23 By segment equipment revenue (solar 
semiconductor) grew 71% YoY RMB61bn Materials revenue (crucibles
diamond wire saw  sapphire) surged 24x YoY and 1x HoH to RMB188bn
Materials gross margin sharply expanded by 273ppt YoY to 547% which
more than offset the 24ppt contraction of equipment segment (to 401%)
Blended gross margin therefore expanded 27ppt YoY to 427%
Administrative expense ratio dropped 1ppt YoY to only 2% in 1H23  RD
expense ratio increased 08ppt YoY to 71% which we believe is essential
given JSGs continuous development of new technology In 1H23 JSG
recognized RMB70mn of fair value gain (1H22 nil) Operating cash inflow
reached RMB1bn in 1H23 a strong recovery from an outflow of RMB52mn
 Key highlights of 2Q23 results Revenue surged 99% YoY to RMB48bn
Gross margin expanded 42ppt YoY and 36ppt HoH to 442% driven by
the ASP hike of materials segment Minority interest surged 12x YoY to
RMB208mn due to the strong growth of non-wholly owned material
business Net profit grew 73% YoY to RMB13bn
 Strong pricing power reflected in the growth of customers
downpayment As at end Jun 2023 contract liabilities (an indicator of
down-payment from customers) surged 49% YoY to RMB104bn
 Risks 1) Slowdown in solar power capex 2) lower-than-expected gross
margin (3) decline in crucible price
