CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Innolight (300308 CH)
Investors focusing on 800G transceivers ramp-up
after 1H23 results
Innolight released 1H23 results Total revenue was RMB4004mn (-54% YoY)
mixed impacts from increasing demand for AI-related transceivers and
deteriorated demand for traditional datacenter products NP was RMB6138mn
(246% YoY) mainly driven by higher GPM and operating cost optimization
1H23 NP was close to the mid-point of the preliminary range Maintain HOLD
with unchanged TP at RMB104
 AI-related transceivers have offset non-AI transceivers Companys
2Q23 revenue showed sequential growth (179% QoQ) primarily attributed
to heightened shipment of 800G transceivers However total revenue fell
slightly in 1H23 as the Company pointed out that the demand for
200G400G transceivers from datacenter was declining This trend aligns
with our previous expectations that AI investment will likely
cannibalize certain traditional server expenditures and negatively affect
sales of non-AI high speed transceivers (link)
 Margins stand out particularly GPM expanded to 311% in 2Q23 vs
295%293% in 1Q232022 NPM also increased to 168% in 2Q23 vs
136%127% in 1Q232022 The increase is mainly due to decrease in
procurement costs and favorable product mix driven by increasing 800G
products shipment
 Maintain HOLD with unchanged TP at RMB104 We lowered 2023-25E
revenue forecasts by 6%-11% as non-AI weakness is greater than our
previous expectations 2023-25E GPM was adjusted to 305%-317%
reflecting favourable product mix as the Company is expected to deliver
more high data rate transceivers that have higher margins The net impacts
from lower sales and higher GPM left NP almost unchanged 1H23 total
revenueNP now accounted for 39%42% of our full-year estimates
 Potential upsidedownside We believe investors are closely monitoring
the scaling up of 800G transceiver capacity and the Companys ability to
sustain the current performance ie sequential sales growth and
continuing margin expansion Meanwhile the deteriorated demand of
200G400G transceivers for datacenter should be on investors radar While
we regard Innolights optical transceivers business positively we believe the
current valuation is full
