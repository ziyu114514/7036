CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Weichai Power (000338 CH)
2Q23E earnings to grow 30-65% recovery story
Weichai pre-announced over the weekend that 1H23 net profit is expected to grow
50-70% YoY to RMB359-407bn representing 50-57% of our full year profit forecast
This implies net profit of RMB173-221bn (up 30-65% YoY) in 2Q23E with the high-
end slightly better than our expectation We continue to like Weichais recovery story
as (1) the significant decline in LNG price will continue to boost the sales of LNG
trucksengines where Weichai has strong presence on (2) easing supply chain
pressure will help KION achieve margin recovery (3) the continuous growth of
engines for agricultural machinery and HDT through rising penetration in LOVOL and
Sinotruk (3808 HK BUY) is on good track We maintain our SOTP-based TPs for
Weichai AH of RMB138HK158 Maintain BUY
 Weichais engine sales continued to outpace industry in 5M23 According to
CICEIA Weichais multi-cylinder sales (HDT and other engines) grew 26% YoY
to 303k units in 5M23 (vs the industry average of 8%) with a market share of
 HDT Industry Sales volume 31% YoY in Jun According to the preliminary
data from Cvworld China HDT industry sales volume in Jun (including export)
grew 31% YoY to 72k units driven by strong demand for gas-fuelled trucks
(helped by the decline in LNG price) and export In 1H23 China HDT sales
volume grew 25% YoY to 474k units representing 57% of our full year forecast
of 829k units (23% YoY)
 Decline in LNG price positive to Weichai LNG price in late Jun has declined
40% from the peak in Dec 2022 We believe it will continue to boost the sales
of LNG trucks given the lower operating cost to truck owners We expect Weichai
to be a key beneficiary as we estimate Weichai has 40% market share in HDT
gas engine Besides Shaanxi Heavy-duty Motor subsidiary of Weichai is a key
player in gas-fuelled HDT segment
and (3) new business growth below expectations
