CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
CTGDF (601888 CH)
Earnings expectation is settling
 2Q pre-announced After market close last Friday (7 July) CTGDF pre-
announced major financial data for its 1H23 results Revenue came in at
RMB359bn up 297% YoY when net profits reported at RMB39bn down
19% YoY This implies 2Q23 revenue and net profits to be RMB151bn and
RMB16bn up 388% and 143% YoY respectively In the announcement
the Company also disclosed that its 1H gross margin has improved by 78%
HoH when that of 2Q has gone up by 367% QoQ
 Our view The RMB324bn sales achieved by Hainan operators for 1H23
should have given a good gauge to what CTGDF could attain over the same
period Meanwhile we estimate Hainan contributed approximately RMB9-
10bn revenue to CTGDF for the quarter and this should slightly track below
us Separately net profit was a small miss on a few potential factors
including 1) lower than expected GPM of 326% (although it continued to
climb QoQ it was still below 2Q22) 2) a weakening RMB which inflated its
procurement cost 3) any bottleneck in accessories SKU which saw
insufficient inventory in 1Q and 4) a rising earnings contribution from airport
DFS with lower profitability Despite these investor expectation on full-year
net profit has already edged down to approximately RMB7-8bn All else
constant if 1H momentum was to extend into 2H we think the Companys
earnings downcycle could approach to its end In other words we believe
any share price rally in the near term would mainly be valuation-driven
 Key long-term initiatives While a diverted travel traffic (to overseas) and
a faltering consumption sentiment were the known drags to CTGDFs
performance we continue to see a few key positive for the Company to
sustain its domestic leadership These include 1) the new Haikou DF mall
when its sales have already surpassed one-third of that of Sanya Haitang
Bay with positive net profits contribution 2) the joint collaboration with
CNSC (49% acquired by CTGDF in March this year) which should yield
operational synergy aside from that of Hainan
 Valuation Our TP is based on 480x end-23E PE which represents its
average since 2020 when market started to re-rate the stock for a series of
policy tailwinds Our TP and earnings estimates are under review
