CMB International Global Markets  Equity Research  Company Update
Yili Industrial (600887 CH)
Full-year guidance unchanged
investor day on 14th Jul and 2Q operational update Overall Yili maintained its
initial guidance of a HSD top line growth with a 03pp uptake in net margins for
the year On a sequential basis 2Q sales has further accelerated from that of
1Q This consists of drivers such as QoQ improvement in UHT milk especially
that of high-end UHT milk double-digit growth in adult formula growth in low-
channel Separately Yili reaffirmed that albeit deflating raw material prices
gross margins will likely remain stable when reasonable discounts to stimulate
retail sales likely offset the savings In other words any improvement in
profitability will be solely driven by operation cost savings Concerning the
remainder of the year Yili remains upbeat and see scope for further recovery to
take place thanks to a high debut density from brands like Satine and
Ambrosial While we remain lukewarm on the dairy segment from a risk-reward
perspective we think Yili is a relative outperformer among its peers thanks to
its operation scales more frequent new launches and above-industry milk
formula growth We are buy-rated
 Raw material cost impact to GPM Despite a small or a LSD drop in raw
milk costs Yili expects a stable GPM for 2023E as the merit will likely be
offset by a small increase in other material costs such as sugar packaging
materials not to mention retail discounts Mix upgrade will be the only driving
force to boost GPM and financially we look for a 02-03pp hike over 2023-
 Earnings assumptions changes We largely maintain our 202324E
estimates For 2023E we continue to assume 1) a 55% 20% 20% liquid
milk low-temp dairy IMF sales growth YoY respectively These underpin a
77% 3-year revenue CAGR between 2022-25E Combined with the GPM
assumptions above our net margins for 2023-25E are set at 80% 83%
87% Overall our forecasts largely tally with managements expectation on
revenue pre-tax profits of RMB 1355bnRMB 125bn We also introduced
our 2025E forecasts
 Valuation Our new TP is based on an updated 240x (from previously
250x) end-23E PE which still benchmarks to its 5-year average Comparing
to Mengniu (2319HK Buy) which we value at -1sd below average we
assign a higher target multiple to Yili to reflects the latters stronger IMF
business outlook in the near term
