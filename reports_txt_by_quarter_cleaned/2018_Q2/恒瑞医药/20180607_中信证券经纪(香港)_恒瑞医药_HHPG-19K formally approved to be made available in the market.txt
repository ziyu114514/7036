a major innovative drug for tumor was formally approved by the
Chinese regulator via a new drug approving serial number of
Macapegfilgrastim injection another blockbuster product under
the Companys line of tumor drug products Macapegfilgrastim
injection is a type of blockbuster long-acting leukocytes (or white blood

pinned high hopes on It is the PEG-rhG-CSF injection that the
non-Myeloid-cancer patients who are receiving treatment with myeloid
suppressing cancer drugs to reduce incidence rate of infections which
are usually in the form of fever and neutropenia Different from the
like-products (both generic drugs of Amgens Pegfilgrastim) that CSPC
Pharmaceutical Group (01093HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical (600789)
launched HHPG-19K has new generic name and is an innovative drug
In 2017 the global sales revenue from Pegfilgrastim injections tallied c
US476bn and Chinas PEG-rhG-CSF injection (Long-acting G-CSF
abbreviated as HHPG-19K) sales revenue stood at US76mn As a
whole the long-acting G-CSF market boasts huge headroom for
expansion as long-acting G-CSF can keep substituting short-acting
product and benefit from expansion in the number of tumour patients
of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group (01093HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical
(600789) are forecast to be Rmb120bn in 2018
Better than local rivals like-products In addition to differences in
molecular structure and generic names the Companys dosage of
Macapegfilgrastim injection approved (06ml 6mg) is larger than those
of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group (01093HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical
(600789)s like-products (1ml 3mg) Seen from performance in clinical
trials HHPG-19K is more efficacious than Amgens Pegfilgrastim

have benefited from their products By contrast HHPG-19K cant be put on the Essential Drug List as it
has the new generic name However we expect it to be put onto the List around 2019 as the new round
of negotiation about the annual adjustments to the List kicks off and regulator attaches great importance
to availability of tumor drugs
A brand new stage for innovative drug business has kicked off as 19 K was approved We view
that approval of HHPG-19K and probable approvals of pyrotinib Taxol albumin and other blockbuster
drugs in the Companys pipeline in 2018 and the application for production of PD-1 (SHR1210) which is
nearly to be approved will mark a fresh starting point for the Company in the development of innovative
drugs Approval of HHPG-19K this time which is finally achieved after withdrawal of application in 2015
and application against in 2017 marks that the Companys innovative drug business has formally
entered the peak harvest time The Companys new products such as apatinib HHPG-19K etc are
expected to fuel a fresh round of swift revenue growth as its reform to refine its marketing by lines of
products proceeds
Potential risks  disappointing progress in drug RD and cut in tender prices for drugs to be procured
by medical institutions
Retain BUY rating The Company boasts a full range of lines of products and innovative drugs full in the
pipeline and leads the domestic peers in presence abroad We revise our 2018-2020E ex-right EPS
estimates to Rmb101122156 from Rmb132158202 Given its enormous advantage in innovate
drugs and scarcity value we retain our BUY rating
