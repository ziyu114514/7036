MIDEA Group 000333CH
Confidence in Q2 Shipments
We continue to like Midea Group on account of its product upgrade story
and continued margin expansion Since the beginning of 2018 Midea has
been the largest beneficiary of foreign buying in Chinas white goods sector
Several factors set Midea apart from its peers its global footprint diversified
product mix corporate governance and technological edge We maintain our
BUY rating with a 12-month target price of RMB67 based on a 16x 2019
brand portfolio leadership position in robotics and high 25% EPS growth
warrant a premium to its peers
Premium Brand to Expand Margins Midea will launch a new high-end
brand including refrigerators washing machines and kitchen appliances
through its dedicated flagship and experience stores which will help drive
margin improvement in 2018-2020E
Air Con Sell-through Rate Remains Strong Air conditioners which
account for 45% of Mideas gross profit saw 40% YoY growth in Q1
While April and May installations have slowed to a 20% growth rate YoY
Midea management still anticipates double-digit growth for the full year With
some industry peers such as Gree reporting an acceleration in AC
installations since May we believe the Groups sales are on track
Stock Supported by Overseas Investors Midea is the 6th largest name in
the MSCI China A Inclusion Index with a weighting of 192% Since the
beginning of 2018 foreign investors have increased their stake to 112%
making Midea one of the most popular A-share blue-chips and home
appliance makers Since its MSCI inclusion Midea has continued to capture
more northbound flow on HK Stock Connect than other white goods names
with more than RMB2bn in net buying
