美的集团 000333CH
美的集团凭借其良好的品牌组合、广泛类型的产品、庞大的业务规模和销售
网络，已成为全球最具竞争力的家电生产商之一。我们对该公司抱持正面看
法，随着该公司在未来几年专注推出新的高端品牌、提升利润率和整合库卡
和东芝，料公司2017-2019 年盈利的复合年增长率保持在26。我们首次覆
盖该公司，并予买入评级，12 个月目标价为67 元人民币，潜在上涨空间为
开拓高端产品以提升利润率：无论是产品数量、市场份额、销售网络还是客
户忠诚度等方面，美的集团都是最具竞争力的家电生产商之一。公司旗下有
多个著名品牌，如东芝、酷晨和伊莱克斯。美的集团将在8 月 9 月于国内推
出新的高端品牌。预计公司将通过提价和引入新型号来提高平均售价。
空调产品推动盈利：空调业务去年录得极高的增长，其毛利占公司总毛利的
48。在今年，市场需求依然强劲，我们预计空调平均售价将上涨300-400
元人民币，并带动收入和利润率上升。
海外业务有增长空间。出口占美的集团总收入的43（若撇除机器人业务，
则占36），占总毛利的30。我们相信，由于美的集团将其业务模式从
OEMODM 转移至经营自家品牌产品（目前仅占海外业务收入的30），中
期而言利润率将会改善。
机器人业务：料2018 年盈利激增，并为长远的利润增长引擎。考虑到工业机
器人在中国的渗透率仍低，以及库卡并表，料美的集团机器人业务将维持长
远增长。另外受惠于折旧及摊销费用下降等因素，机器人业务占总毛利的比
重在2018 年上升至约9（2017 年为6）。
考虑到盈利增长前景，现估值吸引。由于新的高端品牌和出口产品将带动利
润率扩张，我们预测2017-2019 年盈利的年均复合增长率达到26。我们的
预测较目前市场共识预测22为高。我们的目标价是基于16 倍2019 年市盈
率，由于公司有稳健的特许经营模式，加上预期有超过20的盈利增长，我
们认为这目标估值是为合理。风险因素包括：（i）中国房地产和空调销售放
缓；（二）提价导致市场份额下降；（iii）人民币升值损害美的集团的出口。

We have a target price of RMB 67 based on a 16x multiple of our 2019 earnings forecast This
valuation is supported by the 20% earnings CAGR during 2017-2020 and Mideas ROE of over
Our top line expectations are below street but our higher gross margin assumptions put our estimates
8% above 2019 consensus earnings From 2017-2019 we project earnings growth CAGR of 26%
higher than consensus earnings growth of 21%
Midea and Qingdao Haier two of the three large appliance manufacturers both trade for 12-13x 2019E
consensus earnings Midea and Haier both have diverse product portfolios Gree the third large
appliance manufacturer is a pure play on air conditioning Grees lower multiple is on account of the
volatile  nature of its core air conditioning business its recent dividend cut and current overhang on the
stock due potential change in leadership
At 16x 2019E PER Mideas valuation would be higher than domestic manufacturers and in line with the
international manufacturers

PREMIUMIZATION TO DRIVE MARGIN UPLIFT
Midea is one Chinas top three leading producers of large appliances including air conditioning
refrigerators and washing machines Not only does it have extremely high brand recognition being one
of the top three in most product segments it is the only major appliance manufacturer that has a strong
offering in both small and large appliances

Small Appliances Key driver for Consumer Appliances Segment
air conditioning and small appliances were the two most significant profit drivers for Midea in 2017
These two products account for 62% of revenues but approximately 70% of its gross profit Midea is
particularly strong in small appliances where it has held a leading share in induction cookers pressure
cookers and rice cookers for over a decade

New Premium Brand Launch
Midea is introducing a new premium brand which should roll out in AugustSeptember 2018 At launch
the premium brand will only target select product categories but eventually will expand to cover all of
Mideas existing product categories The products will be priced at or above Haiers existing high-end
products Casarte We highlight that Haiers high end Casarte product line has been enjoying rapid
machine sales in 2014 but 7% of segment revenue by 2017
MA and JV Strategy to Drive Margin Increase
Although details of the premium brand are scarce (Midea is keeping the brandname secret for now)
Midea itself is no stranger to high-end products It has been active in MA transactions as well as
forming JVs with premium brands to move up market in the appliance industry

For example Mideas Toshiba acquisition in 2016 provides Midea with upmarket branding and access to
conditioners refrigerators microwaves vacuum cleaners and electric cookers  most which falls into
Mideas broad consumer appliance category In China Toshibas appliances are priced at a significant
premium to Midea For example Mideas best-selling microwave on TMall retails for RMB 379 vs
Toshibas most popular unit which retails for RMB 2000
Mideas 60% owned JV with Cuchen is an example of a JV which will help Midea move up the value
chain Cuchen is South Koreas second largest producer of electric cookers with approximately 40%
market share Through this JV Midea will manufacture Cuchens products and gain expertise in high
end electric cookers while Cuchen will benefit from Mideas manufacturing scale and distribution
Similarly Mideas JV with Electrolux is focused on introducing Electroluxs premium brand AEG to the
China market The AEG brand was officially launched in China at the Appliance  Electronics World
Expo in Shanghai on March 8 2018 As the figures shows Mideas high-end brands are priced
significantly higher than the Midea brand

AIR CONDITIONING CONTINUE TO DRIVE EARNINGS
The air conditioning segment is Mideas most important product category representing 45% of gross
profit Domestically the AC market is dominated by three players Gree Midea and Haier which control
roughly 70% of the market Gree is the leading player in the domestic China AC market However
Midea is relatively stronger in the export market where it leads in market share

Q1 2018 AC Growth Still Strong
2017 was a boom year for Chinas AC market due to hot weather low channel inventory and a
recovering property market following 2015 lows In volume terms Chinas domestic AC market grew
47% YoY to approx 89 Mln units In the export market AC sales grew 10% to 53 Mln units

As of Q1 2018 the air conditioning market in China is continuing to experience strong growth
Gree grew top line revenues 37% in Q1 2018
Mideas air conditioning business grew 40% YoY in Q1 2018 with sell-in and end-user
installations both tracking In April Mideas AC growth decelerated to 20% YoY
Haier AC revenue grew 20% YoY in Q1 2018 with segment revenue growing 20% YoY
For full year 2018 we expect Mideas AC segment to grow 20% YoY in line with current management
expectations
Midea may benefit from higher pricing
In our discussions with Midea management noted that Gree typically charges a RMB 800 premium
over Midea for a similarly configured unit This premium is consistent with our checks in the market
place In addition weve noticed that ASPs of Grees top selling products on TMall Gome and Sunings
online stores are materially higher than Midea

As a result of its lower ASPs Mideas gross margins lag its peers in the AC segment
Figure 10 AC Gross Margin by Manufacturer (Estimated)
Sources Company Annual Report CGIS Research
Note Before new segmentation was introduced gross margin for AC segment was 306% in 2016 vs 301% (as shown)
Midea Closing the Gap
For 2018 we understand that as a result of new models and price increases ASPs on Mideas AC units
would increase by RMB 300-400 Instead of lagging Grees pricing by a historical factor of RMB 700-800
Midea will now would increase by of RMB 300-400
expansion in 2018 We model gross margins for air conditioning to expand from 29% in 2017 to 31%-
32% in 2018-2020 Our gross margin assumptions for Midea are still below Gree but in line with Haiers
current AC margins
EXPORTS MARGIN OPPORTUNITY
Midea derives 43% of its total revenue (35% of its appliances revenue) from international markets while
Gree and Haier historically have derived 15-20% respectively Midea sells products to over 200
countries around the globe and owns 12 production facilities outside of China (in addition to 17
production centres domestically)

We are positive to Mideas exposure to markets outside of China in the following ways
1 International diversification insulates Midea from from swings in Chinas domestic economy real
2 Sales to countries with lower penetration rates of appliance ownership exposes Midea to
geographies with higher potential long-term growth
3 Margins to improve in the medium term as Midea shifts from OEM business model to its own
branded products Gross margins on international sales are currently about 5% lower than

ROBOTICS PPA EXPENSE WINDING DOWN
PPA Expense Winding Down
Midea has been active in expanding into the robotics field in recent years Robotics overlaps with its
core manufacturing business and provides a new growth driver and further diversification for the
in Kuka from 135% to 9455% Midea spent EUR 37 Bln (RMB 27 Bln) for 81% of Kuka
to 9% in 2018 The increase in gross profit for 2018 is driven by acquisition expenses beginning to roll
off In 2017 Midea wrote off RMB 24 Bln on the Kuka and Toshiba acquisitions but annual
amortization will reduce to RMB 06 Bln in 2018 On this basis we expect gross margin for the robotics
segment to rebound to 21% in 2018 up from 145% in 2017
Midea - Building Robotics Expertise
acquisition in 2017 Midea owned 135% of Kuka and has been gradually building expertise in the
robotics market for several years Some important steps include the following
1 Prior to the Kuka acquisition Midea was a long term Kuka customer spending RMB 1-15 Bln
annually on Kuka robots Midea uses Kukas robots primarily for packaging transportation and
count from 200000 in 2011 to around 120000 by 2016
2 In 2015 Midea invested USD 65 Mln to enter into two JVs with Japanese robot manufacturer
Yaskawa Yaskawa is one of the top 4 robotics producers globally which include ABB (ABBN
VX) Fanuc (6954JP) Yaskawa (6506JP) and Kuka One of the JVs is focused on bringing
Yaskawas robots for elder care and physical therapy to the China market The second JV is
focused on bringing Yaskawas industrial robots to the China market
3 In 2016 Midea purchased 178% of Anhui Efort for USD 8 Mln (RMB 45 Mln) Anhui Effort
builds robots for car painting (auto industry) as well as logistics welding painting and
4 In 2017 Midea acquired a controlling stake in Servotronix for USD 170 Mln Servotronix an
and multi axis motion controllers for industrial robots
Long Term Robotics Opportunity
Growth prospects for robotics in China are promising for three reasons (1) increasing wage rates in the
manufacturing sector (2) an aging population and (3) low robotics penetration especially outside the
auto industry

Kuka based in Germany has been historically more focused on the German automotive market At the
Europe In this context Kuka is relatively underexposed to the China market with only 18% of sales
from China in 2017 China was responsible for 30% of total robot demand in 2016 or 87000 out of
288000 robots sold according to the International Federation of Robotics Federation (IFR) Chinas
share is expected to further increase 40% of global robot sales by 2020
Mideas local market knowledge production capabilities and relationships can support Kukas
development in China Mideas customer relationships in fields such as logistics may also prove value
accretive In 2017 for example Kuka entered into a JV with Annto Logistics Mideas logistics subsidiary
which is focused on appliance distribution The JV between Annto and Kuka will develop a standardized
logistics system for Anntos customers  allowing Kuka to leverage Anntos customer relationships
General Industry Robotics Driving Growth
Kuka reorganized its business segments in Q1 2018 The new Auto segment (formerly Systems)
 Logistics segment 20% of revenue)
Kuka grew 18% YoY in 2018 and earned a 3% EBIT margin By 2020 management expects Kuka to
achieve revenues of EUR 45Bln implying 10% CAGR growth Considering Kukas 2013-2017 growth
CAGR of 18% we think managements expectations of 10% growth through 2020 are conservative
Through 2020 management expects EBIT margins to improve to 75% up from 39% adjusted EBIT
margins in 2017 on the back of growth in general industry and logistics

The residential air conditioning business in China is highly volatile due to its dependency on weather
revenue and gross profit
Midea is hiking prices on air conditioners and closing its pricing differential with Gree It remains to be
seen if the market will accept these price increases and if Midea can continue to maintain its current
level of market share in a scenario with higher pricing
Midea has been active in the MA market most recently with the acquisition of Kuka and Toshiba
Toshiba was loss making in 2017 and a turnaround is still pending Regarding Kuka robotics is a
relatively new field for Midea The robotics industry in China is highly fragmented with small scale
and steel rise management has traditionally implemented ASP hikes However management may not
