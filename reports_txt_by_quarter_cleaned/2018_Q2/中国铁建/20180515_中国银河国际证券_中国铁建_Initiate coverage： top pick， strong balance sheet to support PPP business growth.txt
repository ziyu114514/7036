China construction sector
Initiate coverage top pick strong balance sheet to support PPP business growth
The construction sector regained market traction led by 1) better-than-expected PPP review re-
sults and 2) the sectors strong Q1 2018 growth As we highlighted in our previous report central
SOEs should face no downside risk in infrastructure investment benefitting from rising PPP invest-
ment and overseas expansion CRCC-A secured fast earnings growth by increasing its exposure to
PPP investment in Q1 2018 which exceeded market expectations We initiate our coverage on
CRCC-A with a BUY rating and target price (TP) of RMB1250 CRCC-A is our top pick in the A-
share construction sector We expect its earnings to grow at around 14% pa in 2018-2019E As
CRCC-A is less geared than its peers we think it will enjoy faster earnings growth via increasing its
takes in PPP investment Our TP of RMB1250 is based on our CRCC-H share valuation and the A
H premium (discount) assumption (Fig 5) The only downside risk to its earnings and TP is likely
from the Companys conservative approach in pursuing PPPs and overseas business expansion
Investment Highlights
Fast earnings growth secured by increasing exposure to PPP investment With the slow-
down in railway investment CRCC-A secured earnings growth by increasing its exposure to
PPP investment CRCC-A reported earnings growth of 147% YoY in 2017 and 189% YoY in
Q1 2018 The earnings growth was above market expectations as the market was concerned
about a slowdown in PPP investment during the project review period The governments
scrutiny of PPP projects ended in March The results showed that the concern was overblown
A total 1160 projects worth RMB12trn were removed from the PPP database But 614 new
projects worth RMB13trn were added to the database indicating a net increase in PPP invest-
ment With tougher regulations CRCC-A should be able to pick good-quality PPP projects to
sustain its earnings growth in the next 2-3 years
Margin expansion due to improving revenue mix CRCC-A has been conservative in its
PPP business expansion PPP investmentrelated revenue accounted for only c10% of its
total revenue in 2017 Its overseas business accounted for only around 5% of its total reve-
nue So its increasing exposure to PPP investment and overseas business drove a significant
margin improvement for the Company PPP projects offer higher margins than its traditional
railway projects We expect CRCC-As margin expansion to continue in 2018-2019E We
forecast that its gross profit margin will expand from 92% in 2017 to 94-97% in 2018-2019
Strong balance sheet supports its PPP business expansion CRCC-A has the lowest net
gearing ratio of its peers As at the end of 2017its net debtequity ratio was only 73% vs
642% for CCC and 338% for CRG Its healthy balance sheet allows CRCC-A to further in-
crease its stake in PPP investment Under the deleveraging environment this gives the Com-
BUY with a TP of RMB1180 We set our TP at RMB1250 Our TP is based on our CRCC-H
share valuation and the historical CRCC AH premium (discount) (Fig 5)
