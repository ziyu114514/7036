公司醫藥商業實現平穩增長，醫藥工業方面，健康產品增長顯著。銷售費用大幅上
升，行銷力度不斷加大。混改進一步落地，有望進一步激發未來增長動力。考慮到銷
售費用等支出可能增加，我們調低2018年EPS預測至34元股（原355元股）。對比歷
史市盈率和行業市盈率水準，我們給予33倍目標市盈率，目標股價1120元。(現價截至
2017年，公司控股股東雲南白藥控股有限公司引進民營企業新華都和江蘇魚躍作為戰
略投資者，白藥控股股權結構變更為雲南省國資委、新華都與江蘇魚躍分別持有
45%、45%、10%股權，白藥控股及上市公司均變更為無實際控制人企業。經過2017年
調整之後，我們期望2018年這種混改方式進一步激發企業活力，提升企業競爭力。
省醫藥公司實現收入14494百萬元，同比增長75%。我們預計，2018年隨著兩票制的
影響進一步消化，商業板塊有望優化。醫藥商業基本實現雲南縣級以上及部分發達鄉
鎮醫院全覆蓋；同時探索線下零售藥店業務、藥房託管、網上售藥等線上線下管道協
同發展。公司目前實現主要電商平臺全覆蓋，同時，開展在微商等領域內的管道建設
醫藥工業收入整體實現同比增長97%。(1)藥品事業部收入達到50435百萬元，同比增
長256%，表現相對疲弱。公司根據兩票制等醫改政策調整分銷模式，確保產品分銷的
合規性。產品方面，針對藥用消費品消費需求增長的趨勢，篩選內部批文資源，推動
藥用消費品產品體系建設；加快蒸汽眼罩等護理類工業產品的研發和推廣。(2)健康產
品部實現收入43611百萬元，同比增長16%，健康產品管道已實現全國覆蓋，部分發
達地區實現縣鄉一級覆蓋。同時，公司積極發展電子商務，在杭州成立互聯網行銷中
心，以旗艦店形式入駐各大電商平臺。
公司的銷售費用同比上升30%，主要是由於市場維護和推廣費用增加。公司重點部署
在互聯網管道、樓宇管道以及年輕消費群體關注的活動賽事冠名等新型媒體傳播管
道，提升公司品牌在年輕消費人群中的知名度。採用事件型行銷增加產品曝光度，結
合熱門IP，推出相應產品，2017年公司借助熱門影視劇集三生三世十裡桃花和
春風十裡不如你推出雲南白藥養元青十裡桃花限量定制系列和雲南白藥春風十裡
定制款洗漱包；自主打造大IP運動賽事雲南白藥愛跑538，陸續與長沙、重慶、武
漢等地的合作夥伴共同組織開展活動。隨著在行銷方面的投入增大，我們預計2018、
2019年的銷售費用仍可能呈上升趨勢。
