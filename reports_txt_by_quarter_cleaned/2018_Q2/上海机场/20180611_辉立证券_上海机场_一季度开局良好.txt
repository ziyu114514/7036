基於強勁的非航業務收入增長預期，預示著公司正在開啟新一輪穩健成長週期，我們
上調公司2018 年的每股EBITDA，同時引入2019 年預測值，提高目標價為人民幣63
元，分別對應183166 倍估值倍數，維持增持評級。(現價截至6 月7 日)
上海機場2017 年營業收入806 億元，同增159%；歸母淨利潤368 億元，同增
313%，基本每股收益191 元，基本符合我們預期，略高3%左右。每股派息058，派
息率30%。加權淨資產收益率提高26 個百分點至155%。
2018 年首季財報顯示公司業績增長勢頭不減，2018Q1，營業收入達到2281 億元，同
比增2035%；實現歸母淨利潤1018 億元，同比升2862%；基本每股收益053 元。
毛利率勁升，盈利能力處於增長快車道
2017 年上海機場的流量受到控制，航空性業務量僅錄得中低個位數增幅（起降架次
35%，旅客輸送量6%），航空性業務收入僅同比增長6%至3724 億元。儘管航空性
業務受到限制，公司的非航業務錄得高速成長，非航業務收入同比大幅增長26%至
434 億元，其中商業租賃收入同比大升43%。
另一方面，營業成本保持平穩，僅增長61%，2017 年毛利率因而同比提升了47 個百
分點至4982%。此外受益於旗下公司（油料公司和廣告公司）錄得理想業績，投資收
益同比增長了34%至975 億元。
2018 年上海機場的航空流量繼續受壓，起降架次27%，旅客輸送量55%，估計航空
性收入仍保持低位。但國際航線持續錄得高於整體的增速，航線結構進一步優化。
因部分商業合同重新招標等原因，非航業務收入繼續維持高增長，再加上機場收費上
調等因素，帶動總體收入增速創近八年來新高，同比升超過兩成。航線結構和收入結
構的雙雙提升助推首季毛利率同比提升了53 個百分點至5068%，創九年來新高。
財報中顯示，2018 年首季，三項費用率降低了12 個百分點：由於子公司經營成本同
比減少以及費用核算口徑變化，銷售費用同比減少了93%；財務費用同比減少155%，
主要是公司債券已到期，本期無債券利息支出所致。最終淨利潤率提高27 個百分點

公司的機場免稅業務合同3 月底到期，新一輪招標計畫正在進行，將於2018 年
下半年開始貢獻業績，新的提成比例有較大概率由原來的25%左右上漲至不少
於40%。2019 年S1S2 衛星廳建成投入運營後，航站樓總建築面積將擴大
69%，旅客輸送量將超過8000 萬，由此帶來的商業面積拓寬和消費人數提升，
不僅為公司下一輪成長提供堅實的基礎，而且有望開啟新的商業運營模式，充
