We believe the temporary production suspension of Tongling Conch will have a very limited
impact on earnings this year Since Tongling Conch is a major taxpayer in Tongling city we
believe the municipal government will work closely with Tongling Conch to sort out the envi-
ronmental protection issues We maintain our BUY rating and the H-share target price of
HK5950 based on 25x 2018E PBR (A-share target price RMB4510) Meanwhile the two
factors capping the share price performance of Conch Cement are fading ie (i) the relative-
ly cheap valuation of Conch Venture (0586HK) and (ii) the relatively deep share price dis-
count of Conch Cement-A
Investment Highlights
No violation of laws by Tongling Conch In May Tongling Conch a wholly owned subsidi-
ary of Conch Cement received a notice jointly issued by the the Tongling Environmental
Protection Bureau and Tongling Port and Shipping (Local Maritime) Bureau to suspend the
operations of Tongling Conch Pier The pier is located inside the Class B reserve at the in-
take point of the Tongling Water Treatment Plant Since the pier is an important channel for
Tongling Conch to ship cement and clinker products to its customers the suspension of the
pier also led a production halt of Tongling Conch in late May The suspension order is mainly
due to a special action plan launched by the central government in March which requires the
clearance and upgrading of Class A and Class B drinking water source reserves Tongling
Conch emphasized that it had obtained all the necessary licences and that the suspension of
the Tongling Conch Pier was not due to any violation of laws
Very small financial impact Although there is no clear timetable for resuming operations
we believe the financial impact on Conch Cement is likely to be small First of all Tongling
Conch accounted for 552% of Conch Cements total net profit in 2017 We dont expect the
production halt to last very long As Tongling Conch is a major taxpayer in Tongling city we
believe the municipal government will work closely with Tongling Conch to sort out the envi-
ronmental protection issues Meanwhile Conch Cement has organized inspections and re-
views of the rest of its production plants along the Yangtze River No similar situation or risks
exist for its other production plants
Two factors capping share price performance fading In the past few months we men-
tioned two technical factors affecting the share price performance of Conch Cement (i) the
relatively cheap valuation of Conch Venture and (ii) the relatively deep share price discount
of Conch Cement-A These two factors have been fading For (i) the attributable market cap
of Conch Cementmarket cap of Conch Venture has dropped from 110% to about 80%
(Figure 2) which is more in line with the profit contribution now (Conch Cement contributed
84% of net profit of Conch Venture in 2017) Therefore Conch Venture is no longer a cheap
proxy for Conch Cement For (ii) the share price premium of Conch Cement-H over Conch
Cement-A has narrowed from 17% at end-April to currently about 9% closer to the 3-year
average of 64%
Temporary Suspension of Tongling Conch Expected To Have Limited Impact
