CATL is the largest EV lithium battery player in China with a c 30% EV lithium
battery market share in terms of installation in 2017 Close client relationships
and a superior product quality translate into market dominance that should help
CATL continue to gain market share in the EV lithium battery market and maintain
its industry leading position
EV market as the main battery supplier of 4 of the top 10 best-selling models
in 2017 In addition CATL appears in the procurement relationship roadmaps of
key international auto OEMs till the end of automobile model year 2022 which
indicates its potential in the overseas market
Through cooperation with more passenger EV makers CATL should continue to
gain market share in NCM batteries Its new manufacturing bases in Jiangsu
Liyang and Ningde Huxi are well prepared for rising demand
costs implying shrinking unit protability ASP may drop at a CAGR of c11%
in the next three years while we expect COGS to fall at a CAGR of c9% in the
same period However strong sales volume is likely to largely oset the impact
as CATLs strong sales volume CAGR of 48% from 2018E to 2020E should help
As CATL has just listed on the A-share ChiNext market we believe the market is
still on the path of discovering its intrinsic value Hence we adopt a PE multiple of
36x FY19E EPS which is linked to PEG of 12x The multiple implies 20% premium
advantage and potential upside in the overseas market
Key downside risks include signicant changes in the Chinese governments new
energy subsidy policy weaker-than-expected volume growth in the next three
years a quicker-than-expected ASP drop or slower-than-expected cost cuts a
slower-than-expected ramp-up at the Ningde Huxi and Jiangsu Liyang plants

Target price of RMB72 based on 36x FY19E PE
As CATL has just listed on the A-share market on 11 June 2018 we believe the
set an earnings multiple of 36x FY19E PE to value CATL derived from a PEG of
12x Our target price is set at RMB72 implying a 81% upside potential
at 10x PEG We believe that our target multiple should not only reect the
and potential upside in the overseas market which we discuss in the following
International peers listed in Korean and Japan markets are not pure battery plays
as the battery business tend to be only a fraction of their operations and contribute
limited protability However it is worth noting that the international peers are
expected to record a much milder earnings growth pushing up the international
peers PEG multiple to 22x on average
In conclusion we believe that CATL is more suitable to adopt the PEG multiple
range of its A-share peers given its current investor prole We believe a 20%
premium for CATL over its A-share peers is justied resulting in a PEG of 12x
and a FY19E PE multiple of 36x

Earnings sensitivity analysis
As CATLs earnings and margin outlook is heavily dependent on its pricing and
cost trajectory we present the 2019E and 2020E earnings sensitivity analysis
based on dierent inputs of 1) unit ASP decline and 2) production eciency
improvement 
For the base case scenario we factored in 145%100%75% of unit ASP decline
in 2018E2019E2020E and 70%65%20% production eciency improvement
in the same period For a more detailed discussion on our ASP and cost decline
assumptions please refer to the CATLs product pricing trajectory and CATLs
cost per unit trajectory in Summary of nancials section
In conclusion our analysis in Figure 2 below shows that for every additional 05%
of ASP cut in 2019E2020E it will have a negative -6%-8% impact to our earnings
forecasts Meanwhile for every 05% of production eciency improvement in
2019E2020E it will lift our earnings forecasts by 4%5% respectively

The Chinese market leader
Current market share leader
On the back of Chinas soaring EV demand total EV battery installation volume
grew from 42GWh in 2014 to 335GWh in 2017 pacing at a 100% 3-year CAGR
Our analysis of battery installation volume on vehiclesshows industry dynamics
which we believe is a good tracker of order materialization by auto OEMs
CATL seized the opportunity of strong EV industry growth and reported a 3-
year battery sales volume growth at 263% from 2014 to 2017 gaining market
We present an analysis of Chinas 2017 EV battery installations in Figure 3 below
CATL is the market share leader in both LFP (33%) and NCM battery installations
(30%) and thus leads in total EV battery installations (30%) including batteries
that use other kinds of cathode materials (LMO LTO and NCA - see our note in
Figure 3)
The market share gap between CATL and the rest of the pack is more obvious
installation volume in 2017 We believe its market share gap particularly in NCM
batteries reects its edge in technology and manufacturing know-how This is
because NCM batteries answer to the pursuit of a higher energy density level on
a whkg basis a longer driving range per charge and the ultimate goal of a lower
total cost of ownership which is currently driven by Chinese government policy
Although CATL also led in LFP battery installations in 2017 industry peers are not
far behind in the relatively more mature technology particularly BYD

We also tracked the rst 4 months of EV battery installations this year as shown
in Figure 4 below which indicated that the strong became stronger  the market
share of CATL increased to 48%  42% YTD in LFP  NCM respectively from a
30% level in 2017 As government subsidy policy is favorable to batteries with
higher energy density level (ie NCM batteries) we estimated that CATLs NCM
batteries will reach 31GWh in 2020E taking up 86% of its battery volume growth
in the next 3 years thanks to the rising demand of passenger EV which we discuss
in the following section
It is worth noting that monthly market share may be volatile with uctuations in EV
shipments but we believe CATLs market dominance in China will likely continue
partly based on our analysis of future growth drivers in the following section

Market share leader in passenger EVs  future growth
For a good gauge of CATLs exposure to future growth drivers we gathered the
top 10 selling passenger car pure Battery EV (BEV) models in China and monitored
their performance in the rst 4 months of 2018 As summarized in Figure 5 below
the top 10 passenger BEV models collectively account for a c60% domestic
market share in the segment and we observe a trend of gradual consolidation
Among our samples CATL is the main battery supplier to 4 of the top 10 best-
selling passenger car BEV models in China which largely secures its future
per unit basis) including Geelys Emgrand EV and BAICs EU series indicating
that CATL has a even higher market share in terms of installed battery volume

Deeper client relationship through JV and equity
CATL not only positioned itself as the battery supplier to auto OEMs like most
vehicle and CATL emerged as the key supplier in the industry auto OEMs has
Regarding domestic client relationships in particular it is worth noting that not
only CATL is the key supplier to leading auto OEMs (including BAIC Geely SAIC)
it has also set up JVs (SAIC) and received equity investments (Donfeng Motor
Changan) Most of the auto OEMs that set up JVs or invest in CATL are the leading
players in passenger car segment which means CATL appears well-positioned
for future growth
JVs form a stickier relationship with auto OEMs as the structure leads to jointly
developed battery projects which in turn provide a more stable order outlook for

CATL was the rst battery maker in China to work with international brands
the rst EV model of Zinoro1E After the recognition of BMW-Brilliance CATL
continued to expand its passenger vehicle customer portfolio internationally
including names like Volkswagen Daimler Honda Nissan and Renault
Figure 6 shows international auto OEMs and their EV battery procurement

battery purchasing contract awarded by Volkswagen conrms CATL as the sole
battery supplier in China and one of the main battery suppliers overseas Among
Sylphy and Honda is developing an EV model with CATL that is due for launch in
2020 We expect more collaborations with international auto OEMs to materialize
going forward which would make CATL the rst EV battery maker to have a
meaningful global presence

Procurement cost advantage thanks to industry leading
Our due diligence concludes that CATL has an advantage over the industry
average spot price by 7-10% thanks to its leading position in scale fast
In the lithium battery industry raw material purchase contracts are generally
achieve cost decline in the future battery makers tend not to build up inventory
contract is on a rolling monthly basis as over 80% of its cost is determined by
upstream metals Among CATLs inventory 25-35% is made up by raw material
and 40-50% by battery which we believe is healthy considering its inventory days
at 97 days in 2017
We believe that CATL has paced itself and managed to strike a balance
between raw material cost cuts and battery performance As cathode is a critical
that its procurement advantage allowed a signicant improvement to c8% in
2017 from virtually nil in 2015 (see Figure 11 )

Summary of nancials
All segments are driven by lithium batteries
CATL is a pure proxy for exposure to lithium battery related businesses As shown
which include sales of both battery packs and battery cells 2) battery materials
which mainly include sales of NCM precursor materials through its subsidiary
Hunan Brunp 3) others which include battery recycling and battery RD service
revenue Battery systems contributed 83%81% of revenuegross prot in 2017
and we expect a rise to 86% of revenuegross prot each in 2020E driven by
strong EV battery volume growth
As battery materials are mainly represented by sales of NCM precursors we
expect unit ASP movement and volume growth will largely follow the trend of
NCM cathode for which we expect a 22% 3-year revenue CAGR to 2020E The
battery material will consist of 10%9% of CATLs top linegross prot in 2020E
similar to current levels
Regarding other businesses including battery recycling and RD services we
factored in similar growth rates to battery systems Given that battery recycling
occurs at the end of the battery product cycle we believe that it should be highly
revenuegross prot contributions from the Others segment in 2020E which is
skewed to the conservative side as we dont factor in the contribution from
battery RD services

CATLs product pricing trajectory
CATLs battery pack ASP (excluding VAT) has more than halved over the past 3
years and we estimate that ASP has declined by a 3-year CAGR of 22% similar
expect battery pack ASP to decline further responding to the phase-out of the
government subsidy and cost-cut eorts to achieve a lower EV total cost of
ownership
by end 2020 and sets the average battery cost target lower than RMB1wh
to drive technological improvement at EV battery manufacturers We expect a
slightly higher ASP decline CAGR at c11% in the next 3 years for both CATL
and the Chinese industry average The number implies that Chinese industry
average battery cost will achieve RMB099wh (excluding VAT) by end-2020 and
the industry will be fully prepared for the phase-out of the subsidy and re-entry
of international battery players Figure 19 below shows our estimates of CATLs
pack ASP vs the Chinese industry average and Figure 20 illustrates the historical
speed of the ASP decline and our outlook

Direct exposure to government subsidy at c2% of revenue
Chinese government provides EV subsidy to individual auto OEMs directly with
a time lag and other subsidies along the supply chain are not directly linked to
the number of EVs sold Regarding the exit of government subsidy at the end
of 2020 we incorporated the impact on CATLs product in the previous section
adopting government battery cost at lower than RMB1wh as the medium-term
target by end 2020 If we look at the direct government subsidy as % of revenue
CATL reported the level at 1-2% in the past 3 years (see Figure 21 below)
Chinese government is strongly supportive of NEV sector and the Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) mentioned to develop 1-2 domestic
exits Therefore we expect CATL to record the direct government subsidy at lower
than 2% in the next 3 years which we believe is at a reasonable level

CATLs cost per unit trajectory
CATL successfully cut costs by 60% from 2014 to RMB091kWh in 2017 We
believe the cost cuts were made possible by its progress in material sciences
lower procurement cost and higher automation level as illustrated in the previous
As shown in Figure 22 below we built our unit cost assumption based on
raw material depreciation labor electricity and other manufacturing costs We
expect costs to decline at a CAGR of 9% in the next 3 years predominantly
driven by raw material cost savings The reduction in raw material usage reects
improving chemistry energy density the structural parts design of the cell and
eciency gains through scale enlargement
We believe the phase of massive cost cuts due to scale increase is behind us
and the industry including market leader CATL would next seek cost savings by
perfecting manufacturing technology and increasing energy density As a result
we expect energy density improvement to be reected in reduced raw material
usage at a 3-year CAGR of 5% going forward and improving manufacturing
technology to contribute the remaining portion of cost savings
Lets look at the cost-cutting process another way We estimate that in order to
achieve a further 25% cost cut by 2020 to RMB07wh from the current level 84%
and 3% from electricity labor and other manufacturing costs

Strong sales volume should oset shrinking unit
protability
On a watt hourbasis we expect CATLs battery ASP per unit to fall at a 3-year
CAGR of 11% and cost per unit to drop at a 3-year CAGR of 9% As a result
margin per unit should decrease from RMB050wh in 2017 to RMB029wh in
2020E in our view (see Figure 24)
Figure 24 CATLs unit pricing cost and margin
Source Company data Deutsche Bank estimates
Nonetheless the strong growth in capacity and sales is likely to largely oset
shrinking unit protability We expect total sales at CATL to increase from
118GWh in 2017 to 197295415 GWh in 201820192020 respectively
representing a 62%64%77% utilization rate in the next three years The lower
utilization rates than 76% in 2017 are due to the new manufacturing plants at
Jiangsu Liyang (10GWh) and Ningde Huxi (24GWh) which will gradually ramp up
Ningde Hudong and Qinghai Xining plants to reach full capacity in 2020E while
other factories gradually ramp up (see gure 26)
