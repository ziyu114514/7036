Initiate coverage Dual engine to support earnings growth
With business diversification and a recovery in the mining business CRG-As earnings in 2017 ex-
ceeded market expectations Including its one-off asset impairment loss of RMB6bn its net profit in
2017 still rose 294% YoY The strong growth momentum continued in Q1 2018 with net profit rising
ings growth from PPP investment and overseas expansion support by the central government CRG
-A outperformed CRCC-A and CCC-A CYTD as it delivered the highest earnings growth in 2017
and Q1 2018 We initiative coverage on CRG-A with a BUY rating and target price (TP) of RMB910
We expect its earnings to grow at a CAGR of 14% in 2017-2019E Its plan for a debt-to-equity swap
means CRG has a strong incentive to boost its earnings in 2018 especially after it made a substan-
tial one-off asset impairment in 2017 Our TP is based on our H-share valuation and AH premium
(discount) assumption (Fig 5)
Investment Highlights
Earnings beat in 2018 and 1Q18 CRG-A reported revenue growth of 88% YoY in 2017 and
101% YoY in 1Q18 led by increasing exposure to PPP investment and overseas expansion
Earnings rose even more with margin expansion led by an improving revenue mix effective
cost control and the recovering mining business The Company reported its gross profit margin
expanded from 79% in 2016 to 91% in 2017 After some one-off asset impairment the Com-
pany reported its net profit margin expanded by 03ppt YoY in 2017 The margin expansion
continued in Q1 2018 thanks to its fast-growing municipal construction business and overseas
expansion
Steady earnings growth expected to continue from rising PPP investment and overseas
expansion We were concerned that the slowdown of its traditional railway business would
constrain its earnings growth in 2018 But CRG-A achieved faster growth than we expected
due to increasing exposure to PPP investment We remain confident that CRG-A will continue
to be one of the key beneficiaries of rising PPP investment The government review of PPP
projects turned out to be less negative than the market expected With the addition of some
new projects total investment in all approved PPP projects by the end of April  suggested a net
restore market confidence in the construction sector With the improving quality in PPP projects
database CRG-A is able to pick even higher-quality PPP projects to secure healthier growth
for the Company
Debt-to-equity swap plan to fund future PPP investment CRG-As leverage is not that
pany announced on 6 May that it is planning a debt-to-equity swap with the subject assets
being the equity rights of certain subsidiaries of the Company to be acquired by investors in the
debt-to-equity swap As it may constitute a material asset restructuring trading of its A-shares
was halted from 7 May This should help CRG-A reduce its leverage providing more room for it
to raise debt for future PPP investment
BUY with a TP of Rmb940 We set our TP to RMB910 Our CRG-A share TP is based on
our CRG-H share valuation and the historical CRG AH premium (discount) (Fig 5)
