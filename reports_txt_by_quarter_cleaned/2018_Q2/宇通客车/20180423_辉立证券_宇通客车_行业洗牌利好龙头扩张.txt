2017 年業績下滑逾兩成
宇通客車2017 年實現營業收入 33222 億元，同比減少 733%；歸母淨利潤 3129 億
元，同比減少 2262%；每股收益141 元，每股派息05 元。業績低於預期的主要原因
是客車行業受到新能源車補貼政策退坡打擊。
行業蕭條期，市占率大幅提高
財政部2016 年12 月30 日下發通知，將純電客車的國家補貼下調了20 萬元每輛，地
方補貼不得高於國補的一半，並增加了滿足三萬公里運營里程的申領條件。受行業政
策變動影響，7 米及以上客車的全國年銷量下降了14%至167588 輛，宇通客車產品主
要覆蓋大中型客車市場，銷量也被拖累，但好於行業平均，同比僅下滑524%，至
67268 輛。市占率反而得以提升，在大型客車市場佔有率為288%，提升29 個百分
點；中型客車市場佔有率為 442%，提升 49 個百分點；在大中型新能源客車市場佔有
率提高34 個百分點至283%。
2013 年以來，由於新能源車行業的特殊性，第四季度旺季現象明顯，導致宇通客車全
年業績中第四季度淨利潤平均占比接近一半。2017 年因前三季銷量低迷，四季度公司
為完成年初制定的銷售目標進行了較大力度的促銷活動，削弱了盈利能力，四季度銷
量大幅增長12%的基礎上，淨利潤反而同比下滑31%。全年毛利率錄得2632%，較上
期收窄 15 個百分點。
三萬公里申領條件使公司應收賬款中的國家補貼資金回款週期拉長，對公司的資金和
應收賬款計提都產生了重大影響。公司 2017 年利息支出 333 億元，比上年同期的 088
億元飆升了 279%，財務費用因此增加79%至49 億元；應收賬款壞賬準備計提 507 億
元，比上年同期的 361 億元增長了 4044%。最終淨利率 954%，較上期降低了19 個
百分點。不過，隨著2018 年申領條件減少至2 萬公里，公司的國補回款週期有望縮
短，壞賬將部分轉回，資金壓力將得到緩解，2018 年業績有望回暖。

補貼新政下，行業洗牌利好龍頭擴張
2018 年國家新能源客車補貼政策的進一步調整，提高了行業入門難度，加速優
勝劣汰，行業格局將繼續優化，利好宇通汽車這樣的行業龍頭繼續擴大市場佔
技術方面，公司的核心技術如節能水準處於領先地位，整車安全與控制技術、
整車輕量化技術、車聯網服務平臺等多項核心技術取得突破進展，大大提高了
產品競爭力，與 2016 年相比，整車平均能耗降低 5%以上。海外高端產品專案
順利推進，2017 年公司新能源客車出口量同比增加18%至8412 輛。與國外同行
相比，公司的新能源產品技術成熟度、規模化優勢顯著，且已經通過當地認
證，具備品牌和技術優勢，未來值得期待。
總體上，雖然2018 年產品單價或繼續承壓，但隨著行業格局進一步優化，產品
經過時間的檢驗，技術實力強、產品優質、綜合性價比高的企業將在未來新能
源客車市場中居於主導地位，海外市場也有望成為公司業績的另一增長點。
