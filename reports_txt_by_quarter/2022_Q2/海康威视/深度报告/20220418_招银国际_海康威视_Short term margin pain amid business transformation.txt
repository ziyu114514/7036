Hikvision top-line remained strong but GPM erosion was a negative surprise in 
FY21 & FY1Q22, due to 1) more implementation work of large-scale smart city 
projects, 2) increasing innovative business contribution and 3) additional costs 
due to supply chain disruption. However, we are encouraged to see reducing 
reliance on public security projects. Margin decline is a temporary yet inevitable 
short term pain amid business transformation, in our view. Maintain BUY.    
 FY1Q21 top-line beat but margin miss. Hikvision reported in-line FY21 with 
revenue of RMB81.42bn (+28% YoY) and net profit of RMB16.80bn (+26% 
YoY). However, GPM missed (-2.2 ppts YoY to 44.3%) as more low-margin 
implementation work was performed in FY4Q21 (FY4Q21 GPM: 40.0%, -4.2 
pct pts YoY). FY1Q22 revenue growth remained strong at +18% YoY to 
RMB16.52bn but net profit missed (merely +5% YoY to RMB2.28bn), largely 
due to unexpected GPM erosion (-3.1 pct pts YoY to 43.7%).  
 Innovative business revenue doubled YoY in FY21. With continuous R&D 
effort (R&D expense was up 29% YoY to RMB8.25bn in FY21), Hikvision has 
expanded its camera applications with AI/ sensors technology. Innovative 
businesses (Smart Home/ Robotics/ Thermal/ HikAuto/ Storage, etc.) revenue 
doubled YoY to RMB12.27bn, accounting for 15% of FY21 revenue (vs. 10% 
in FY20). Core surveillance business also recorded strong recovery from 
COVID-19 (+20.6% YoY to RMB69.15bn in FY21). Meanwhile, we are 
encouraged to see lower reliance on public security projects as PBG China 
revenue contribution continued to decline (32% in FY21 vs. 35% in FY20).  
 Targets stable FY22E GPM despite mix change. Hikvision FY21 & FY1Q22 
GPM erosion was a negative surprise. The decline was attributable to 1) local 
government specifically appointing Hikvision to be the system integrator of 
large-scale Smart City projects (Construction GPM was low at 23.0% vs. Core 
products of 46.4%), 2) increasing innovative business contribution (GPM 
improved to 40.5% in FY21 from 37.3% in FY20, but still below blended GPM) 
and 3) additional raw materials/ logistics cost caused by supply chain 
disruption. Hikvision will continue its high-inventory strategy and targets to 
maintain a stable GPM in FY22E despite revenue mix change.  
 Maintain BUY. We cut FY21-23E net profit by 6-7% to reflect lower gross 
margin. Maintain BUY with new target price of RMB57.10 (prior RMB62.06). 
Key downside risks include city-lockdowns and softening macro.

Valuation  
Hikvision (002415 CH, BUY, TP RMB57.10) 
We raised our target price to RMB57.10 (prior RMB62.06), based on unchanged 29x FY22 
P/E, 1-SD above its three-year mean. We believe Hikvision deserves a re-rating as supply 
chain risk is mitigated and new growth drivers (innovative businesses) are emerging. Also, 
Hikvision announced plan to spin off its smart home and robotics businesses on STAR 
board. We believe the spin-off could provide new financing channel to support IoT/ AI R&D.
