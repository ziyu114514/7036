Innolight announced FY21 and 1Q22 results. FY21 revenue/NP grew 9.2%/1.3% 
YoY to RMB7.7bn/RMB877mn. 1Q22’s revenue/NP grew 41.9%/63.4% YoY to 
RMB2.1bn/RMB217mn. We think the results are solid and largely in-line with our 
expectations. We maintain our positive outlook on overseas Cloud demand and 
believe Innolight will continue to gain share in the optical transceiver market. 
Reiterate BUY, with unchanged TP of RMB45.6. 
 
Innolight’s solid 4Q21/1Q22 results are largely within our expectations. 
FY21 revenue was 1% lower than our previous estimate and net profit to 
shareholders was 3% higher than our estimate. 1Q22 revenue/NP 
accounted for 21%/20% of our full year forecasts. We expect 2Q22-4Q22 
sales will deliver steady QoQ growth, following a similar trend as in 2021. 
GPM improved to 28.1% in 4Q21 from 24.5% in Q3, mainly due to favorable 
product mix as hyperscale CSPs are ramping up the deployments for 
200G/400G optical modules. However, GPM in 1Q22 dropped to 26.3% as 
a result of continuing component shortage and increasing costs affected by 
domestic partial lockdown.  
 
Outlook remains positive given the demand from overseas Cloud 
companies stays strong. In our previous report (Link), we pointed out that 
Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all posted record Capex, and guided very 
positive budgets for this year to support their cloud services and AI-related 
businesses. We maintain our positive outlook for Innolight. According to 
Omdia, Innolight had taken up 12% market share in the optical transceiver 
market (ranked No. 2). The Company has gained the most share among the 
top 10 players, mainly driven by the increasing sales of its 200G and 400G 
optical module products. 
 
Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB45.6. We maintain BUY and 
keep our target price at RMB45.6. Potential risks include weaker capex from 
global cloud companies, slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and worse-
than-expected component shortage.
