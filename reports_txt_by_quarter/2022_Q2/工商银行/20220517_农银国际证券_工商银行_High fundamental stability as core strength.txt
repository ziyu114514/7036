Company Report 
High fundamental stability as core strength  
May 11, 2022 
 Lower provision expenses to support real economy would expand earnings capacity 
 Interest rate cut cycle would raise NIM pressure in coming quarters, but robust 
balance sheet growth could help offset the impact 
 FinTech investment to maximize ICBC’s edge in big data; expect CIR to inch up 
 Reiterate BUY on high fundamental stability. Our GGM- based H/A shr TPs imply 
target 22E P/B of 0.73x/0.87x

Lower risk buffers to increase earnings. To raise support for the real economy, the 
government encourages big banks to reduce risk buffers, based on an announcement on  
Apr 13, 2022. So far, the said request has not been mandatory but we believe major  
banks, including ICBC, would take steps to fulfill its social responsibility. As such, we 
factor in a -2% CAGR in the bank’s provision expenses over FY21-24E, which would 
gradually reduce the bank’s provisioning ratio and provision coverage ratio to 2.78% and 
187.84% by end-24E. Nevertheless, in view of rising asset quality risk from the property 
sector, we project the bank’s NPL ratio to inch up by 1bps-3bps YoY each in FY22E-24E 
and reach 1.48% by FY24E, assuming the scale of NPL handling remains similar. 
 
More NIM pressure to come. Resurgence of interest rate cut cycle from Dec 2021 in 
China would once again elevate NIM pressure in banks. Despite declining deposit rates, 
we expect loan re-pricing would delay the impact of interest rate cut by a few quarters, we 
forecast ICBC’s NIM to narrow by 2bps-5bps YoY each in FY22E-24E to 2.02% by FY24E. 
In our opinion, its robust total assets and total liabilities CAGRs at 6.0% and 5.8% in 
FY21-24E would defend the bank against NIM pressure and support NII CAGR at 5.3% in 
FY21-24E.  
 
CIR on the rise. To maximize the bank’s competitive edge in big data, we forecast 
FinTech investments would continue in coming years. By keeping technology-related 
expenses at ~3% of its topline revenue, we anticipate CIR to rise mildly to 29.29% by 
2024E; operating expenses would increase at 11.2% CAGR over FY21-24E.

Maintain BUY on high fundamental stability. ICBC’s defensiveness against policy and 
macro changes has been consistently proven. The bank is one of our long-term core 
holdings in the sector. Leveraging its market-leading position, we believe the bank  
would continue to show consistent fundamental strength. We adjust our H/A TPs by -0.9% 
and 0.9% to HK$ 7.45 and RMB 7.70 by assuming (1) topline and net profit CAGRs at 
6.3% and 6.8% in FY21-24E; (2) a higher sustainable ROAE; (3) a higher long-term 
growth rate; (4) a lower equity risk premium (ERP).The TPs imply 0.73x/0.87x target 
FY22E P/B. Reiterate BUY. 
 
Risk Factors: 1) Radical change in business environment induced by heavy-handed 
supervision and policies; 2) Potential asset quality deterioration in specific sectors and 
geographical areas; 3) Rising CIR on technology development; 4) Elevating NIM pressure 
amid interest rate cut cycle; 5) Resurgence or prolonged COVID-19 pandemic.
