1Q22 was a beat, thanks to better GP margin. We highly appreciate Midea’s shift 
of focus to generate better than industry’s growth in the next 3 years. Therefore, 
we maintain BUY but fine-tuned TP to RMB 67.79, based on 15x FY22E P/E 
(down from 22x), vs China/ Int’l peers’ avg. of 13x/ 14x. 
 FY21 results inline and 1Q22 results beat. For FY21, sales/ net profit grew 
by 20%/ 5% YoY, 4%/0% above BBG est., while 1Q22, sales/ net profit 
increased by 10%/ 11%, 0%/8% above BBG est.. For FY21, domestic/ 
overseas sales growth were 25%/ 14% YoY, and ToC/ ToB sales growth were 
13%/ 39% YoY. Within ToB business, Industrial Technology/ Building 
Technologies/ Digital Innovation/ Robotic & Automation sales growth were 
44%/ 55%/ 51%/ 23%. We find 1Q22 results impressive, given the drag from 
pandemics, and the beat should be attributed to GPM improvement (+0.5ppt 
YoY to 22.2% in 1Q22), driven by ASP increases and better product mix. We 
are now more optimistic about GPM in FY22E, driven by more raw material 
hedging and CNY depreciation.  
 Aiming to “optimize sales and improve margins” in FY22E. We believe 
Midea maintains its guidance of “~10% sales and ~10% NP growth” in FY22E, 
supported by its robust ToB sales growth and its focus on “optimize sales and 
improve margins”. We think the actual drivers are: 1) premiumization, where 
COLMO sales could reach RMB 8.0bn (vs RMB 4.0bn in FY21 with 300%+ 
YoY), 2) ramp up of overseas business, as more than 600 Chinese 
management are deployed in various regions since last year and entered into 
more POSs and e-commerce platforms and 3) development of ToB business.  
 Beware of potential sector downturn and the shift to ToC businesses is 
important. Management is highly cautious about home appliances demand 
for the next 3 years and believes its ToB business can become a new growth 
driver, which mainly consists of Building control, Auto parts supply chain, 
Energy control and Automation businesses. Sales accounted for 22% in FY21, 
and we expect to reach ~30% by FY25E, with a 17% sales CAGR during 
FY21-25E. For auto parts supply chain, Midea has edges in drive system, 
thermal management system and auxiliary driving system. It has secured 
orders from Volkswagen, and already touched base with Tesla. For KUKA 
business, orders are extremely robust, as Midea had entered BYD, CATL and 
Apple’s supply chain, and we expect it to deliver sales volume of 30K/ 50K-
60K in FY22E/ 23E (vs about 20K at the time of acquisition).  
 Maintain BUY but cut TP to RMB 67.79 (16% upside). We reiterate BUY 
and cut FY22E/ 23E NP by 7%/ 6% to factor in a weaker GP margin. Our new 
TP is based on 15x FY22E P/E (down from 22x due to sector downturn). It is 
now trading at 13x 22E P/E (vs China/ overseas peers’ avg. of 13x/ 14x).
