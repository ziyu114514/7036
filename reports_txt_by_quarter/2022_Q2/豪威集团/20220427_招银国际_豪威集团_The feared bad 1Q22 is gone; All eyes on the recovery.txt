Willsemi announced 1Q22 results. 1Q22 revenue/NP to shareholders declined 
10.8%/13.9% YoY to RMB5,583mn/RMB896mn, which accounted for 20%/18% 
of our full year forecasts. The Company expected NP to shareholders will have 
50%+ QoQ growth in 2Q22, driven by products structure adjustments and market 
recovery. Although we remain positive on Willsemi’s long-term outlook, we expect 
short-term performance is challenging under current market environment. 
Maintain BUY with reduced TP of RMB200.0. 
 1Q22 results missed estimates. Although our previous forecasts were more 
conservative than consensus, 1Q22 results still missed expectations. Despite 
another satisfactory quarter of non-mobile CIS growth, 1Q22’s revenue 
dropped 10.8% YoY. Mgmt. attributed the decline to 1) further weakness in 
smartphone shipment and 2) lowered semi distribution sales due to logistic 
disruptions. GPM dropped 1.2% to 35.3% in 1Q22 (vs. 36.5% in 4Q21), 
impacted by clients’ pricing strategy under share gain pressure.  
 High level of inventories raised investors’ concerns. The Company’s 
inventories level was equal to ~4.6x monthly sales in 4Q21 and further 
increased to 5.7x in 1Q22. The mgmt. have made clear that most of the 
inventories are standard products and will not have higher asset impairment 
risk. However, such level of inventory balance has surely caused market 
concerns, especially under current market sentiment. In addition, the 
resurgence of COVID cases and partial lockdown measures may require the 
Company to excessively build up inventories to secure productions, adding 
difficulty to offload inventories in near-term. 
 Tough market environment challenges Company performance. Although 
we remain positive on Willsemi’s long-term outlook, we expect short-term 
performance to be challenging. By segment, we expect the growth in non-
mobile CIS to remain largely intact. 1Q22 non-mobile CIS is estimated to grow 
70% YoY, while full year growth is forecasted at 36.1%. However, we have 
cut our expectations for mobile CIS sales, given lowered smartphone 
shipment projection. Sales from mobile CIS is expected to decline 3.5% YoY 
in 2022 vs. previous forecast of 10% growth.  
 Maintain BUY with TP of RMB200.0. We lowered our TP to RMB200 based 
on 35x FY22E P/E multiple (vs. prior 42x), given depressed market sentiment 
and weakened consumer confidence. Potential downside risks include: 1) 
worse-than-expected global economy that curbs consumer spending, 2) 
higher level of inventory and 3) possible disruption in logistic and production.
