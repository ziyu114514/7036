 1Q22 earnings largely inline. Tigermed reported 1Q22 revenue of 
RMB1,818mn, up 102% YoY, accounting for 26% of our full-year estimate. 
Attributable net income was RMB518mn, up 14% YoY, and attributable 
recurring net income of RMB378mn, up 65% YoY, accounting for 23% of our 
full-year estimate. By segment, revenue of Clinical Trial Solution (CTS) 
jumped by c.150% YoY in 1Q22, thanks to the Company’s active involvement 
in COVID-19 MRCTs (multi-regional clinical trials) and strong clinical demand 
from innovative drugs and medical devices. Excluding COVID-19 related 
revenue, CTS income grew by c.50% YoY in 1Q22. Gross profit margin (GPM) 
improved from 37.6% in 4Q21 to 38.8% in 1Q22 due to milder RMB 
appreciation in the quarter as well as fast revenue growth of high-margin 
services such as data management and statistics analysis (DMSA) and lab 
services. Considering the shrinking size of pass-through fees from COVID-19 
related revenue and the possible trend of RMB depreciation, we expect 
Tigermed’s GPM to continue to improve in the rest of 2022. In 1Q22, non-
COVID-19 related new orders increased by c.50% YoY, serving as a solid 
driver for Tigermed’s future growth. 
 Omicron outbreaks in China had limited impact on business operation. 
Tigermed conducts clinical trial services in 2,418 clinical centers (or hospitals) 
in China, with 66 centers in Shanghai and 35 in Changchun. Shanghai and 
Changchun account for a combined 4.2% of Tigermed’s total operating clinical 
centers in China. In addition, Shanghai and Changchun contributed c. 6.7% 
of Tigermed’s total number enrollment in April. Tigermed has adopted a series 
of actions to insure the smooth operation of clinical trials. In April, only c. 500 
out of the 12,000 enrolled patients missed clinical follow-ups while many of 
the 500 patients continued their treatment. As for lab services business, 
Shanghai contributes less than 20% of Tigermed’s total lab service revenue, 
indicating limited impact on the overall growth of lab services. Management 
aims to achieve above 40% YoY recurring net profit growth in 2022E 
assuming the COVID-19 outbreak in Shanghai would ease by the end of April. 
 Focus on high-margin business. Management aims to prioritize the 
expansion of high-margin businesses, such as clinical trials operation and 
DMSA while takes a conservative strategy on the SMO business given its low 
profitability nature. Tigermed is also actively exploring business opportunities 
with MNC clients in China and in the Great Bay Area and Boston in the US.  
 Maintain BUY. We revise our TP from RMB183.56 to RMB173.39, based on a 
9-year DCF model (WACC: 9.84%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%). We forecast 
revenue to grow 36%/31%/29% YoY and attributable recurring net income to 
grow 41%/34%/33% YoY in FY22E/23E/24E.
