Goertek posted strong 1Q22 revenue/recurring NP growth of 43%/46% YoY, in-
line with its preliminary results, mainly driven by 125% YoY growth in smart 
product segment, such as VR (Quest 2) and gaming console (PS 5), in our view. 
Also, Goertek released upbeat 1H22 profit alert of 20-40% YoY growth, which 
implies 2Q22 NP of RMB1.18-1.52bn, up 54-99% YoY. Looking into 2H22E, we 
believe Goertek growth momentum will continue with multiple product launches 
from new-gen AirPods, Quest 2 Pro and PS VR2. Overall, we expect Goertek’s 
earnings to grow 33%/21% in FY22/23E, backed by 62%/26% growth in smart 
product segment (VR, gaming console, smart watch). We believe recent pullback 
provides good buying opportunity (17.7x FY22E P/E), given its solid product 
roadmap and high earnings visibility in AR/VR and gaming console biz. Maintain 
BUY and raised TP to RMB48.0, based on rollover 28x FY22E P/E (7-yr hist avg). 
 Strong 1Q22 on strong VR and gaming console product cycle. Goertek 
reported solid 1Q22 results with revenue/recurring NP of RMB20.1bn/ 878mn, 
up 43%/46% YoY, in-line with its preview earlier. We attribute it to 1) AirPods 
recovery with product launch in 2H21, 2) stronger VR products (Oculus Quest 
2), and 3) share gain in gaming console client (PS 5). For 1H22E, company 
pre-announced net profit of RMB2.08-2.42bn, up 20-40% YoY, implying 2Q22 
NP growth of 59-99% YoY, with mid-point 33% above consensus estimate. 
We think the profit alert alleviated market concerns on AirPods weakness, 
COVID-19 impact and VR momentum in 2022. 
 2022 Outlook: AR/VR and gaming console as dual growth engines. We 
estimate AirPods shipment will rebound with 13%/6% YoY to 88mn/93mn in 
FY22/23E, and Goertek will maintain at 43% share allocation. In addition, we 
believe Goertek VR/AR and gaming segment will become major growth driver 
(51% of FY22E sales), which will grow at 62%/26% YoY in FY22/23E, backed 
by new product cycle from Oculus Quest 2 Pro and Sony PS VR 2 in 2H22E, 
as well as share gain in Sony PS 5. 
 Reiterate BUY and raised TP to RMB48.0 We revised up our FY22-23E EPS 
to reflect upbeat 1H22 outlook and stronger momentum in VR/gaming console. 
Our new TP of RMB48.0 is based on rollover 28x FY22E P/E (vs prior 35x 
FY21E P/E), based on 7-year hist. avg P/E. We believe recent correction 
offers good opportunity to accumulate the stock.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB48.0 (58% upside) 
Our new TP of RMB48.0 is based on rollover 28x FY22E P/E (vs 35x FY21E P/E prior). 
Following recent correction on concerns over demand weakness, we think the stock is 
attractive at 17.7x FY22E P/E, given 21% FY22-24E EPS CAGR, strong earnings visibility 
and improving ROE.
