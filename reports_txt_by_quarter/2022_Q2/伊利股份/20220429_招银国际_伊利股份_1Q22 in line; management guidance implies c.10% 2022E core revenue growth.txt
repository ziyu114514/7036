4Q21 net profits came in at RMB761mn, up 3% YoY and was slightly below our 
estimate on higher-than-expected promotional expense for the Winter Olympics. 
Raw milk appeared to be a smaller drag to the quarter’s GPM which came in 
slightly higher YoY at c28%. Overall, 2021 is reported on track with Yili’s guidance, 
achieving 18% recurring net profit growth with NPM expansion of 0.5pp. 
Meanwhile, 1Q22 results kicked in line with our estimate at a 13% revenue growth 
albeit any pandemic-driven lockdowns. Along with the announcement, Yili also 
guided for a RMB129.6bn/ 12.2bn revenue/ profits before tax targets for 2022E, 
and these imply 17.2%/ 20.8% YoY growth respectively. The targets take into 
account, in our view, the impact from Ausnutria consolidation starting from 2Q22 
(previously recognized as JCE), after Yili raised its stake in the former to 59.17% 
since mid-March. Excluding the event, we estimate 2022E core revenue growth 
to be c10%, which is c3% below our previous forecasts. Despite this, we raise 
our 2022E revenue by 3% to reflect the net impact of the above, and hence our 
slightly higher net profits estimates. We are buy-rated. Our new TP is still based 
on 28.5x (unchanged) end-22E P/E which represents +1sd above its 3-year 
average.  
Highlights from management call: 
 Revenue/ net profit came in at RMB1,106bn/ RMB8.7bn in 2021, +14%/ +23% 
YoY and continued to top the league among dairy firms in Asia. Volume 
increase, sales mix upgrade and price increases or reduced promotions on 
certain SKUs contributed 7.5%, 3.8% and 2.5% to revenue growth, 
respectively, which also drove +0.5ppt improvement YoY in GPM to 30.3%. 
 All main segments, including liquid milk, milk powder and products, frozen 
dairy, recorded DDG, at +11.5%, +25.8%, +16.3% YoY, respectively.  
 Liquid milk: home-temp liquid milk continued to outperform the industry in 
terms of growth, achieving 40% market share, the No.1 in the industry.  
 Milk powder and products: IMF achieved the highest growth and 2nd 
largest market share in the industry. The cheese business recorded 150%+ 
revenue growth and +6.3ppt market share improvement in 2021 YoY.  
 Frozen dairy: has maintained the leading position in the sector for the 27th 
year.

2 
 Targets and outlook: Management targeted to achieve 9-10% NPM by 2025E and 
lead Yili to become the largest dairy firm globally in longer term. They believed in a still 
large upside in China’s dairy market, given <25kg annual per capita milk consumption 
in China, compared to the global average of 113kg.  
 Management was positive on liquid milk, especially higher-end SKUs, which would 
be driven by consumption upgrade and penetration into lower-tier cities in China.  
 Milk powder could accelerate as management expected birth rate to rebound on 
fading Covid impact and favorable birth policies that China has been issuing.  
Management was confident to maintain steady growth and market share expansion 
in the segment in 2022E.  
 Cheese could embrace its prime age in the next 3-5 years, given a still large space 
for product differentiation, channel expansion and consumer education in the 
Chinese market.  
 Covid impact: The negative impact from outbreaks and lockdowns since Mar in several 
important regional markets, such as Shanghai, was mainly on the efficiency of logistics 
and deliveries, while the “supply guarantee” policies in different cities under lockdowns 
could even result to be favorable for such industry leader as Yili, which was preferred 
by local governments or consumers when choosing the products for the guarantee of 
daily necessities. 
 Raw milk price was expected to remain overall stable in 2022E, as demand-supply 
was likely to remain in balance for the year, according to management. In longer term, 
raw milk price may still trend up, on expected increasing demand for dairy products, but 
a dramatic uptick was unlikely as the government has been issuing favorable policy for 
dairy upper stream to boost raw milk production which, though, should be better aligned 
with downstream need in the future as the industry was expected to be increasingly 
consolidated.
