We believe the worst for CTGDF is likely over, upon signs of re-opening in 
Shanghai from June onwards and the gradual rollout of pro-growth policies. While 
domestic travelling, in our view, might not stand at the forefront to see immediate 
benefits from the re-opening, expectation of travel resumption has been building 
up towards 3Q with reference to the cases over past few years. From here, we 
see scope for travelling demand to recover sequentially into 4Q, particularly when 
the quarter is seasonally clustered with festivals and shopping campaigns that 
catalyze leisure spending. Earnings-wise, 2Q should look dismal given a c.90% 
decline in airport traffic to Shanghai Airport and that to Hainan, in our view, 
unlikely to look significantly better. City-wise lockdown could also represent a 
temporary hiccup in delivery logistics for online sales. That said, our channel 
check suggested that margins have been holding relatively well during 5.1, as 
contrasted to our previous expectation that underpinned our HOLD rating. 
Consider also when consensus gradually edges towards our below-market 
estimates (we were 6%+ below), CTGDF’s risk-reward is turning more favorable 
to us. We recommend investors to look past the weak 2Q, which is gradually 
being priced-in, and we upgraded CTGDF to BUY with a higher TP of RMB232 
(from RMB192). 
 
Earnings revisions. We cut our 2022E revenue by c.17% as a result of 1) 
a 19% cut in 2022E revenue of Shanghai Airport/ Sunrise; and 2) an 18% 
cut in 2022E Hainan offshore duty-free related revenue which now stands at 
RMB67bn (from RMB81bn). Separately, we raised our 2022/23E GPM by 
1.5/1.3pp. These in aggregate explain a 12% cut in our 2022E net profits. 
We are still c.6% below consensus. 
 
Hainan’s duty-free related sales target. We also lowered our forecast from 
the official RMB100bn to RMB80bn, based on an 80%+ market share (2021: 
c90%) that CTGDF could achieve on the island.  
 
Valuation. Our new TP is now based on 46.5x (up from 34.0x) end-22E P/E 
which represents 2-year average (up from -1sd below average) since mid-
2020. We raise our target multiple to reflect the potential and imminent re-
rating which will likely be fueled by the sequentially recovering, though 
bumpy, domestic tourist traffic.
