 
1Q net profits came in at RMB 2.56bn, down 10% YoY and was slightly 
below market consensus considering the result only tracked c.22% of 
consensus FY estimate. CTGDF previously announced RMB 2.4bn net 
profits for Jan-Feb. This implies net profits for March was only RMB160mn. 
We believe this was mainly attributable to Hainan’s operation closure in 
March. 
 
Despite the soft performance of March, gross margins improved to 34% in 
1Q22 when that compared to only 28% in 4Q21, thanks to the narrowing 
discount after management pledged to adhere to more disciplined 
promotions along with competitors. GPM looks to have troughed. That said, 
whether 1Q’s momentum could extend further into coming quarters remains 
the “known unknown” to us especially when the supply chain of Sunrise 
Shanghai’s online business was unexpectedly disrupted by the city’s 
lockdown. We will keep watching the trajectory.  
 
Trading at -2SD below average, earnings cut looks to be the major event to 
drive share price performance from here. Our 2022 forecast is still c.6% 
below consensus after trimming 3% of our 2022E net profits to reflect the 1Q 
results. Our new TP of RMB192 (from RMB212) is based on an updated 34x 
(from 36.5) end-22E P/E which still represents -1sd below 3-year average. 
Key highlights from management call: 
 
Covid impact was overall under control in Hainan so far, according to 
management, while a major uncertainty for the business is the covid 
situation and policy in other regions in China, such as Shanghai.  
 
Key expansion project: the Haikou International Duty Free City has its 
investment promotion phase completed by 1Q22 and entered into the 
construction phase, which, however, has to be suspended due to difficulty 
for construction teams to travel to Hainan from Shanghai given the city’s 
current lockdowns. The target opening of the City, though, remained Sep 30, 
2022 as previously planned. 
 
Online business development: an integrated online platform connecting online 
and offline, domestic and overseas, and duty-free and taxed businesses has been 
established, which is endowed with a potential customer portfolio made of c.22mn 
subscribers on CTGDF’s wechat mini-program. Management indicated online 
business is currently and will be a key focus for the company in the next 3-5 years.

Other takeaways: 
 
Logistic system: Phase I of the company’s own logistic center in Hainan 
has been completed by 1Q22, with an area of 50,000m2 while Phase-II will 
have 40,000m2. The new logistic system would help the company speed up 
its shipment and improve its operating efficiency, and the benefit would start 
to emerge from May, according to management.  
 
Business development with luxury brands had to slow down in Mar-Apr 
due to travel restrictions for people from/to Shanghai, where many brands 
have their China headquarter, though some luxury houses have been 
making recruitment in Hainan already.  
 
Inventory increased c.6.2% YoY in 1Q22, mainly due to the company’s 
intention to ensure sufficient SKUs to sell considering the current tumultuous 
global macro-economic and geo-political environment, while only a very 
small portion is made of stock aged 1 year+. 
 
The rate of visitation to CTGDF’s stores was relatively low so far despite a 
high purchasing rate (c.70-80%) and management expected to attract more 
visitations through various measures that would improve shopping 
experience including expansion of operating space of stores, more efficient 
payment and easier delivery.  
 
Overseas channel expansion will be another key focus for the company in 
the next 3-5 years. Stores in Hong Kong Airport, Hong Kong city, Macau 
Airport and Cambodia continued to make positive net profit in 1Q22, and 
Macau city duty-free shop opened in the quarter. CTGDF planned to 
continue to expand its footprint overseas, focusing on SEA first, or 
regions/countries with a higher presence of Chinese travelers.
