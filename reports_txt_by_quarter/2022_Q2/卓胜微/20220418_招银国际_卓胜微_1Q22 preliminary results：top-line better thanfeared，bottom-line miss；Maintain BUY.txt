Maxscend announced 1Q22 profit alert. 1Q22 revenue is estimated to grow 12.4% 
YoY to RMB1,330mn, while mid-point NP is expected to decline 7.9% YoY to 
RMB454mn. Given tough macro environment (unexpected geopolitical tension in 
Euro, partial lockdown in China), in addition to known weak smartphone demand, 
the Company delivered a satisfactory result in our view. A double-digit revenue 
growth for a tough quarter could dispel investors’ concerns over the Company’s 
capability to expand product portfolio. Lower margin is well expected with product 
portfolio expansion, but the degree exceeded our previous estimate due to recent 
supply chain uncertainties. We lowered our bottom line forecasts and cut TP to 
RMB278. Maintain BUY.   
 Revenue grew double-digit, despite of high base and weak smartphone 
shipment. 1Q22 revenue is estimated to grow 12.4% YoY, as RF module (L-
PAMiF) has been mass-produced. Due to the unusual seasonality caused by 
the pandemic, 1Q21 was the best quarter during the year in terms of sales. 
Given the high base and recent weakness in smartphone market, a double-
digit revenue growth for the first quarter should dispel investors’ concerns over 
the Company’s ability to continue to make breakthroughs in product 
development and win clients’ orders.  
 Lower profitability due to anticipated margin compression and 
unexpected supply chain uncertainties. 1Q22 NP is expected to decline 
10.4% - 5.4% YoY, due to 1) incremental R&D fees for fab-lite program, 2) 
unfavorable product mix as product portfolio expanded into matured 
categories, such as sub-3GHz receiver modules, 3) rising material price and 
4) higher inventory level to ensure supply chain security. 
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB278. We lowered our FY22E NP by 9%, due 
to prolonged supply chain disruption. We also adjusted target P/E multiple to 37x 
FY22E P/E (vs. prior 50x), 1-SD below historical 2-year average, reflecting 
smartphone market weakness, margin pressure and supply chain uncertainties.  
 Potential risks include 1) weaken consumer demand, 2) intensified competition, 
3) slower-than-expected R&D and 4) further deteriorated marco environment. 
Potential upside includes M&A opportunity.
