Tigermed (300347 CH) 
 
 
 
Expect business rebound in 2024E  
 
Tigermed reported 2023 revenue of RMB7,384mn, up 4.2% YoY, and attributable 
recurring net income of RMB1,477mn, down 4.1% YoY. Revenue/ attributable 
recurring net income missed our forecast by 2.9%/ 12.1%, respectively, mainly 
due to shrinking COVID vaccine revenue, slowdown in global R&D activities, 
and contracted margins stemming from temporary pricing adjustments coupled 
by relatively lower lab facility utilization. New orders signed in 2023 amounted 
to RMB7.85bn, down 18.8% YoY, mainly due to ~RMB1.2bn reduction of COVID 
pass-through orders. Nonetheless, the total backlog experienced a mild uptick 
of 2.1% YoY, reaching RMB14.1bn by the end of 2023, which provides a solid 
foundation for sustainable growth. Management has observed early indicators 
of a demand resurgence and anticipates that both revenue and attributable 
recurring net income will achieve mid-teen growth in 2024E, signaling a robust 
recovery from the previous year. 
 Early signs of demand recovery. Tigermed experienced heightened 
volatility in client demand in 2023 due to subdued global biotech funding and 
escalating competition in the clinical CRO market. However, management 
has observed a positive shift in macro sentiment since late 2023, with 
biopharmaceutical funding in China exhibiting a significant sequential 
rebound. In Jan-Feb 2024, Tigermend’s new orders regained double-digit 
growth, particularly in the US and Australian markets, according to the 
management. With this trend to continue, management maintains a positive 
forecast for full-year demand. Additionally, we want to highlight Tigermed’s 
promising growth potential in China’s market as the government persists 
with its supportive policies for domestic pharmaceutical R&D.  
 Well-progressing globalization strategy. The challenges of the industry 
did not dampen Tigermed’s commitment to globalization. Underpinned by a 
growing and dedicated team of 110 PMs and CRAs, Tigermed’s US clinical 
operation saw rapid growth in revenue and backlog in 2023. Its localized 
clinical operation team enables Tigermed to better capture opportunities 
from both Chinese pharmaceutical companies looking to enter the US 
market, as well as from US clients not fully served by global clinical CROs. 
Tigermed acquired a Croatia-based clinical CRO, Marti Farm, in Jan 2023, 
further bolstering its service capabilities in Europe. Tigermed has 
established clinical teams in South Korea, Southeast Asia and Australia. 
Owing to its strong performance in the global market, Tigermed signed 15 
MRCT projects in 2023. We think a well-established global network will help 
Tigermed in mitigating potential geopolitical risks. 
 Maintain BUY. We revised our TP from RMB80.31 to RMB68.57, based on 
a 10-year DCF model (WACC: 10.95%, terminal growth: 2.0%), to factor in 
slower projection of revenue and recurring net income growth. We forecast 
Tigermed’s revenue to grow 13.3%/ 17.7%/ 21.9% YoY and attributable 
recurring net income to grow 14.2%/ 22.7%/ 27.4% YoY in 2024E/ 25E/ 26E, 
respectively.
