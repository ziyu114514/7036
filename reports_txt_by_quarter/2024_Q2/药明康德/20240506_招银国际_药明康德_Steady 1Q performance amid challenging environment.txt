WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
Steady 1Q performance amid challenging environment  
 
WuXi AppTec reported 1Q24 revenue of RMB7,982mn, down 11.0% YoY, 
attributable recurring net profit of RMB2,034mn, up 7.3% YoY, and attributable 
adjusted non-IFRS net profit of RMB1,913mn, down 18.3% YoY. 1Q24 revenue 
/ adjusted Non-IFRS net income accounted for 20.4%/ 16.8% of our 2024 full-
year estimates, both moderately lower than historical ranges. Non-IFRS gross 
profit margin deteriorated by 2.3ppt to 38.7% while non-IFRS net profit margin 
decreased by 2.1ppt to 24.0% in 1Q24, due to the decline in CDMO revenue 
from COVID commercial projects, pricing erosion, ramp-ups of new facilities in 
its Testing and Biology segments, and escalating costs in its ATU segment. 
Non-COVID D&M revenue (in WuXi Chemistry segment) showed positive 
growth in 1Q24, up 1.2% YoY. Despite a challenging start of 2024, mgt. has 
upheld its revenue guidance of RMB38.3-40.5bn for 2024, projecting growth of 
2.7% to 8.6% YoY, excluding revenues from COVID-19 commercial projects. 
Furthermore, mgt. reiterated that the adjusted non-IFRS net profit margin would 
be align with the 2023 level. 
 TIDES business continued to serve as a significant growth driver. In 
1Q24, TIDES revenue delivered impressive growth of 43.1% YoY with 
substantial 110% YoY growth in backlog. Both revenue and backlog 
maintained a strong momentum from a high base in 2023. Mgt. expects 60% 
revenue growth for the TIDES business in 2024. Moreover, the additional 
22k-liter solid-phase peptide synthesizers commenced operation in Jan 
2024, enhancing the total capacity to 32k liters. Plans are in progress to 
expand new peptide production capacity in Taixing, Jiangsu, to meet robust 
customer demand. 
 Moderate recovery in clinical CRO&SMO business. In 1Q24, revenue 
from the Clinical CRO&SMO segment grew by 11.0% YoY, with SMO 
revenue increasing by 26.4% YoY. The growth aligns with the upward 
trends reported by several domestic clinical CRO&SMO companies in 2023 
and 1Q24. The demand in China's clinical stage pharmaceutical R&D is 
expected to lead the recovery, mirroring the recovery pattern observed in 
overseas markets since1Q23. 
 Solid customer relationships amid uncertainty. WiXi AppTec added 
over 300 new clients in 1Q24, consistent with the level seen in 1Q23. 
Encouragingly, revenue from global Top 20 pharmaceutical companies 
reached RMB2.7bn (~34% of total revenue), indicating a YoY increase of 
4.2% excluding COVID-19 commercial projects. However, mgt. admitted 
that the draft of the Biosecure Act has started impacting WuXi ATU in 
acquiring new clients and orders in the US market. 
 Maintain BUY. To factor in the uncertainties from geopolitical risks, we cut 
our TP from RMB67.53 to RMB53.23 (based on a 10-year DCF model with 
WACC of 10.73% and terminal growth of 2.0%). We forecast revenue to 
grow by -5.6%/ +10.0%/ +12.5% YoY and adjusted non-IFRS net income to 
grow by -12.4%/ +10.5%/ +16.4% YoY in 2024E/ 25E/ 26E, respectively.
