CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH) 
 
 
 
4Q23 & 1Q24 earnings not exciting; but more 
positive drivers to come  
 
Hengli’s net profit in 2023 was +7% YoY to RMB2.5bn, which is -5%/+3% versus 
our/consensus estimates. Net profit in 1Q24 dropped 4% YoY to RMB602mn, 
due to weak demand for excavators’ hydraulic components and an increased 
expense ratio. We trim our earnings forecast in 2024E/25E by 13%/15%, mainly 
due to lower volume assumptions for excavator-related products. Our TP is 
revised down to RMB64, based on 31x 2024E P/E (historical average). We still 
like Hengli as (1) revenue contribution from non-excavator components 
continues to increase; (2) product expansion to ball screws (a key component 
of robots), which started trial production in 1Q24, will likely serve as a new 
growth driver; (3) the commencement of hydraulic components production base 
in Mexico starting from 2Q24 will help speed up its penetration in the US market.    
 Key highlights in 2023 results: Revenue in 2023 grew 10% YoY to 
RMB9bn (2%/19%15%/17% growth of hydraulic cylinders / pump & valve / 
hydraulic systems / components). In particular, sales volume of all non-
excavator products reported growth. Blended gross margin expanded 
1.3ppt YoY to 41.9%, driven by hydraulic cylinders. EBIT, however, grew 
only 8% due to a higher SG&A expense ratio. Net profit in 2023 grew 7% to 
RMB2.5bn while operating cash inflow rose 30% YoY to RMB2.68bn. In 
4Q23, net profit increased by 26% YoY to RMB745mn, driven by 16% 
revenue growth and gross margin expansion (to 46%).  
 Key highlights in 1Q24 results: Net profit dropped 4% YoY to RMB602mn, 
due to a 3% YoY decrease in revenue, 0.8ppt YoY gross margin contraction 
(to 40.1%) and an increase in expense ratio in general, which offset the 
increase in finance income (helped by weak RMB). Net profit in 1Q24 
accounted for 22% of our full-year estimates (run rate in 1Q23: 25%).  
 Maintain BUY. Our new TP of RMB64 (previously: RMB83) is based on 31x 
2024E P/E (rolled over from 2023), equivalent to the historical average. We 
no longer assign a valuation premium (previously 1SD above the historical 
average) as we expect relatively stable earnings growth between 2024E 
and 2026E.  
 Risk factors: (1) further weakness in the demand for hydraulic components 
for excavators; (2) slower-than-expected new business development
