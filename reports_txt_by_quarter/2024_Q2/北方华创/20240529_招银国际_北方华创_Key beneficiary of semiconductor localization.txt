CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Naura Technology (002371 CH) 
 
 
 
Key beneficiary of semiconductor localization  
 
We recently held an NDR with Naura Technology’s management and we 
maintain our positive outlook for the Company. We expect Naura to deliver 
robust revenue growth on capex expansion from downstream clients and 
accelerated semi localization trend. In addition, we believe the Company 
could be one of the beneficiaries of the recently launched “Big Fund III” 
(US$47.5bn) in China. Naura is currently our favourite under the semi 
localization theme. Reiterate BUY rating for Naura (002371 CH), with an 
unchanged TP at RMB405. 
 Geopolitical tensions have driven major economies worldwide to pursue 
resilience over efficiency, leading to significant investments to strengthen 
domestic chip fabrication capabilities. The recently established “Big Fund 
III” (US$47.5bn) in China is so far the largest phase of the series, with 
registered capital of RMB344bn (vs. Phase I/II: RMB139bn/RMB200bn). 
The phase III underscores yet another Chinese government’s effort to 
achieve self-sufficiency in semi amid the escalating geopolitical tensions. 
Previous phases focused on chip fabrication, equipment, materials, etc., 
and we expect similar investment interests for Phase III, as well as a 
potential focus on AI-related areas. We expect Naura to be one of the 
beneficiaries. 
 Looking forward, Naura will likely maintain robust growth on capex 
expansion from clients and accelerated semi localization trend. Key 
drivers of revenue could be from order wins in CCP, CVD and cleanser 
products. The Company disclosed that new orders signed in 2023 were 
RMB30bn, of which 70%+ were for semiconductor equipment and 15% 
were for new energy/PV. We think these orders will support 40% revenue 
growth in 2024.  
 We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura (002371 CH), with an 
unchanged TP at RMB405, based on the same 39x 2024E P/E. We 
raise our GPM forecasts by 1.9ppt and 3.9ppt for 2024/25E, considering 
larger revenue contribution from more advanced equipment. This 
accretive impact on net profit was offset by a higher projection for R&D 
spending (~11% of total revenue), as the Company is expanding its 
product coverage. Risks: 1) intensified competition from overseas and 
domestic peers, and 2) escalating geopolitical tensions.

National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund (The 
Big Fund) 
The National Integrated Circuit Industry Investment Fund, known as the Big Fund, was 
created in 2014 with registered capital of RMB139bn. The initial phase focused on 
developing China’s semi manufacturing capabilities with major investments directing 
towards leading Chinese semi foundries, such as SMIC (688951 CH) and Hua Hong Semi 
(1347 HK). Additionally, the fund supported other parts of the semi ecosystem, such as 
materials and equipment, laying the groundwork for a more self-sufficient semi industry. 
According to ijiwei’s analysis, 67% of the fund was invested in IC manufacturing, 17% in 
chip design, 10% in packaging, and 6% in equipment and materials. 
 
Big Fund II was launched in 2019, significantly expanding its scope and financial flexibility 
with registered capital of RMB200bn. This phase shifted its focus to strengthening the 
upstream semi supply chain, particularly in equipment and materials. Investments were 
aimed at companies producing essential semi equipment, such as etching machines and 
testing equipment. Phase II also aimed to further reduce China’s reliance on foreign tech 
and support domestic semi solutions.  
 
Big Fund III is so far the largest phase of the series with registered capital of RMB344bn. 
This phase underscores yet another Chinese government’s effort to achieve self-
sufficiency in semi amid the escalating geopolitical tensions. The investments are likely to 
further the previous objectives (advanced materials, manufacturing capacity and 
equipment, etc.), while potentially adding other critical areas in AI developments.
