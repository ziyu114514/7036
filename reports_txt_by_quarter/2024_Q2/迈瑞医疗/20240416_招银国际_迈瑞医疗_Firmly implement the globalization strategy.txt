Mindray (300760 CH) 
 
 
 
Firmly implement the globalization strategy 
 
Bloomberg reported (15 Apr) that the European Union is set to launch an IPI 
investigation into China’s procurement of medical devices, seeking to address 
concerns about the policy’s unfair favouritism towards domestic suppliers in China. 
According to anonymous sources, the investigation could be announced as early 
as mid-April and may result in restricting Chinese companies’ access to tenders in 
the EU. In May 2023, the US-European Union Trade and Technology Council 
(TTC) issued a statement indicating that the US and EU were exploring possible 
coordinated actions to address China’s non-market policies and practices. 
 The International Procurement Instrument (IPI) regulation acts as a new 
tool to tackle market protection in public procurement by third countries. 
Under the IPI, the European Commission can initiate an investigation into a 
non-EU country’s practice if it recurrently undermines EU companies’ access 
to its procurement market. Upon initiation, the Commission will invite the third 
country concerned to enter into consultations and seek to eliminate or remedy 
any restrictive practices. The investigation can be suspended at any time if the 
third country takes satisfactory corrective actions. Otherwise, the European 
Commission will adopt an IPI measure in the form of a score adjustment or an 
exclusion of tenders. The IPI measure applies to procurement contracts of at 
least EUR15mn for works and concessions, and EUR5mn for goods and 
services, which expires after 5 years but may be extended for a further 5 years.  
 The IPI regulation allows room for mediation. China is an important 
market for global medical device players. Revenue from China accounted 
for 13% of Siemens Healthineers’ total revenue in FY23. Moreover, a majority 
of medical device MNCs have established factories in China and complied with 
the identity of domestically-produced medical devices which enables them to 
access to China’s government procurements. Therefore, we believe that the 
primary objective of the IPI investigation is to foster reciprocal access to 
international markets, rather than incurring losses for both parties involved. 
Given that the investigation can extend up to nine months, or even 14 months 
under justifiable circumstances, there remains a degree of uncertainty 
surrounding the outcome of the IPI process.    
 Limited impact on Mindray’s business. Mindray’s revenue from Europe 
accounted for 5.9% of its total revenue in 1H23, which is relatively 
modest. Additionally, Mindray does not hold any individual EU tenders with 
contract values exceeding EUR5mn. Furthermore, markets outside of Europe 
and America account for a significant portion of global medical device demand; 
for instance, Siemens Healthineers' revenue from regions outside the US and 
EMEA constituted 33% of its total revenue in FY23. Consequently, we believe 
that there is considerable potential for Mindray to further expand its business 
in markets beyond America and Europe.  
 Maintain BUY. We maintain our TP of RMB383.43 based on a 9-year DCF 
model (WACC: 9.0%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%).
