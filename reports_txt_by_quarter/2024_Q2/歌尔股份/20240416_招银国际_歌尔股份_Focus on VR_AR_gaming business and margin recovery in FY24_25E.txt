Goertek (002241 CH) 
 
 
 
Focus on VR/AR/gaming business and margin 
recovery in FY24/25E  
 
Following a challenging 2023, we expect AI-driven upgrade and AR/VR product 
launches will boost revenue and profitability recovery in FY24E, and impact of 
share loss of the major TWS project should normalise in 2H24E. In the longer 
term, we believe Goertek will continue to benefit from AR/VR secular trend with 
more product launches from major players such as Meta, Sony, Google, 
Samsung and Huawei. For FY23, revenue/earnings decline of -6%/-38% YoY 
was mainly dragged by TWS order loss and weak VR/AR demand, but we are 
encouraged by continued GPM recovery in 4Q23 (10.6% vs. 7.7%/10.1% in 
2Q/3Q23). To reflect FY23 results and gradual recovery in FY24/25E, we 
trimmed FY24/25E EPS by 9%/11% and adjusted TP to RMB17.56, based on 
same 25x FY24E P/E (7-yr hist avg). Maintain BUY. 
 2024/25 Outlook: Riding on “AI+XR” trend, PS5/Quest 3 ramp-up and 
margin recovery. For 2024, we are positive on shipment momentum of 
PS5/Quest 3 and stabilised hearable product segment, and we also believe 
Apple’s Vision Pro and edge-AI trend will accelerate AR/VR/XR product 
cycle, benefiting Goertek as a global AR/VR/XR OEM leader. In 2024/25, we 
expect AR/VR/XR product pipeline will come from major players such as 
Meta, Sony, Google, Samsung and Huawei. Overall, we expect acoustics 
precision component and smart products segment (gaming, AR/VR) will 
rebound 4%/9% YoY in FY24E (vs -7%/-7% in FY23), while hearable 
products (AirPods, Android TWS) will drop 22% YoY in FY24E. GPM will 
recover to 10.5%/10.5% in FY24/25E (vs 8.9% in FY23E), given improving 
utilization and hearable product margin recovery. 
 FY23 earnings bottoming with 4Q GPM recovery. FY23 sales/net profit 
decline of 6%/38% YoY were mainly impacted by TWS share loss and 
VR/AR demand weakness, but we are positive on improving 4Q GPM to 
10.6% (vs. 7.7%/10.1% in 2Q/3Q23), backed by better utilization and cost 
control. In 2H23, precision components/hearable products/smart product 
segments posted -6%/+10%/-23% YoY, and GPM recovered to 
20.4%/8.4%/8.7% in 2H23 (vs. 20.6%/4.1%/5.9% in 1H23).  
 Maintain BUY. We think AR/VR technology leadership and product roadmap 
in TWS/XR/acoustics/gaming segments will enable it to benefit from industry 
recovery and new MR product cycle in FY24/25E. Maintain BUY with 
lowered TP of RMB 17.56. Upcoming catalysts include new XR product 
launches and continued margin recovery
