Luxshare (002475 CH) 
 
 
 
FY23 in-line with better-than-feared 1H24 
earnings guidance; Solid outlook ahead 
 
Luxshare posted FY23 revenue/NP growth of 8%/20% YoY, largely in-line with 
pre-announcement of 20-25% YoY, while 1H24E earnings guidance of 20-25% 
YoY (implying 2Q24E 18%-27% YoY) is above market expectations. We believe 
the strong 1H24 outlook is mainly driven by 1) datacenter connectivity 
(optic/copper) products, cooling and power solutions, and 2) auto biz 
momentum on stronger NEV and ADAS/AD demand from overseas markets. 
Looking forward, despite recent macro headwinds and iPhone shipment 
weakness, we believe Luxshare is well-positioned to capture opportunities in 
datacentre connectivity business, automotive connector business, gain share in 
iPhone/MacBook/iPad/Watch OEM/components and Apple’s multiple product 
launches in 2H24E. We slightly adjusted FY24-25E EPS by -1/-1% to factor in 
FY23 results. The stock now trades at 14.2x/11.5x FY24/25E P/E, close to 1-
SD below 5-yr avg. P/E. Maintain BUY with TP of RMB46.61 based on same 
24x FY24E P/E.  
 FY23 & 1Q24 mostly in-line. Luxshare’s FY23 revenue/earnings growth of 
8%/20% YoY was mostly in-line with earlier preannouncement. By segment, 
CE/computer/auto/communication delivered +10%/-34%/+51%/+13% YoY. 
Mgmt. highlighted business breakthrough with key customers in datacentre 
connectivity products, cooling and power product solutions with potential 
client/order wins. Auto business saw healthy growth momentum backed by 
strategic partnerships and solid auto product portfolio. In addition, Luxshare 
also announced 1Q24 revenue/earnings growth of 4.9%/22.5% YoY with 
GPM of 10.7%, above market expectations. 
 Better-than-feared 1H24 earnings guidance; datacenter and auto 
business as key growth drivers. Luxshare pre-announced 1H24E 
earnings growth of 20-25% YoY, implying 18%-27% YoY growth in 2Q24E. 
We believe the solid 2Q24E earnings is driven by 1) accelerated demand in 
datacentre connectivity, 2) auto business expansion in both domestic and 
overseas markets, and 3) GPM recovery and expense controls. 
 Attractive risk/reward at 14.2x/11.5x FY24/25E; Reiterate BUY. We 
slightly adjusted FY24-25E EPS to reflect FY23 results. The stock now 
trades at 14.2/11.5x FY24/25E P/E, 1-SD below 5-year hist. avg P/E. 
Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB 46.61 based on same 24x FY24E P/E. 
Catalysts include top module/ iPhone share gain, datacenter/auto tier-1 
business progress and Apple’s multiple new product launches in the coming 
months.

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY with new TP of RMB 46.61  
We derived our new 12M TP of RMB 46.61 based on same 24x FY24E P/E. We believe this is justified as Luxshare 
continues to deliver strong earnings growth, market share gain and product expansion to capture datacentre, Apple and 
NEV opportunities in the next 3-5 years.   
Upcoming catalysts include top module/ iPhone share gain, datacenter/auto tier-1 business progress and Apple’s 
multiple new product launches in the coming months.
