China Vanke-A 
Contracted sales growth to stagnate  
■ Though Vanke’s core net profit increased by 11% yoy in FY19, the company 
cut DPS for FY19 which disappointed investors.  
■ We forecast a yoy decline in its contracted sales in FY20F on the back of 
slower sales momentum amidst the Covid-19 outbreak in China.  
■ We downgrade Vanke-A from Add to Hold with a lower TP of Rmb29.7, based 
on a lower 7.8x FY20F P/E. 
Decline in FY19 DPS a disappointment to investors    
Although Vanke reported core net profit rose 11% yoy to Rmb39bn in FY19, the DPS 
decline to Rmb1.045 (from Rmb1.07 in FY18) disappointed investors. Management 
explained the decline in the payout ratio to 30% (34% in FY18) was due to prudent cash 
flow management amid the Covid-19 outbreak, and is confident of maintaining a stable 
payout ratio in the next few years. 
Weak contracted sales performance ahead 
Vanke reported contracted sales only rose 4% yoy to Rmb630bn in FY19. Management 
estimates a shortfall in contracted sales of Rmb51bn in Feb-Mar 20 on the back of 
continued Covid-19 outbreak in China. In view of a delayed schedule for project launch, 
we revise its FY20F contracted sales to Rmb622bn (down from Rmb740bn), translating 
to 1% yoy decline. At end-19, it had unbooked sales of Rmb609bn, leaving sufficient 
room to grow its topline in FY20F-21F. However, we expect its gross profit margin (GPM) 
for recognised sales to decline gradually on the back of higher land cost. 
Active landbanking in tier 1 and tier 2 cities to continue  
In FY19, it acquired gross land bank GFA of 37.2m sq m at an average land cost of 
Rmb6,252/sq m, a 15% yoy increase as it spent 79% of its total land acquisition cost on 
tier 1 and 2 cities. The new land bank GFA acquired was lower than the contracted sales 
GFA in FY19 (41.1m sq m); therefore we think it will continue to actively look for new land 
bank in FY20F to avoid land bank depletion.  
No plans for spinning off its property management unit 
Vanke’s property management (PM) unit reported total revenue of Rmb12.7bn, up 30% 
yoy. At end-19, its PM unit had a total contracted GFA of 640m sq m (+26% yoy), in 
which its GFA under management amounted to 450m sq m. However, Vanke has no 
plans for spinning off its PM unit in the near term.  
Downgrade from Add to Hold with a lower FY20F P/E  
We cut FY20F/21F EPS by 7%/8% to factor in a slower construction and delivery 
schedule. We downgrade Vanke-A from Add to Hold in view of its weaker sales and profit 
growth prospects with a lower TP of Rmb29.7, based on a lower FY20F P/E of 7.8x (9x 
previously), which is the 5-year average 12-month forward P/E. A key upside risk is 
stronger-than-expected contracted sales. Prolonged Covid-19 outbreak and further 
economic slowdown in China are key downside risks.
