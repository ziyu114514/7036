Bottom line of RMB38.9bn was 4.8% and 5.9% below our forecast and consensus’ 
in 2019, respectively, mainly because of less profit contribution from JCE. We 
trim our earnings forecast by 6.7% in 2020 and 4.9% in 2021. TP is trimmed to 
RMB31.6, equivalent to 8.0x 20E P/E. Maintain BUY recommendation. 
 
Net profit growth slowed down to 15% in 2019. Revenue and net profit 
grew by 23.8% to RMB367.9bn and 15.1% to RMB38.9bn, respectively. The 
reported net profit was less than 4.8% of our forecast and 5.9% of street’s. 
Major discrepancy came from share profit from JCE which tumbled by 39.6% 
to RMB3.8bn. DPS was maintained as RMB1.045 per share that resulted in 
payout ratio decline from 34% in 2018 to 30% in 2019. 
 
Contracted sales grew by 4% in 2019. Contracted sales amount and area 
gained by 3.9% to RMB630.8bn and 1.8% to 41.12mn sq m in 2019, 
respectively. About 42.89mn sq m (worth RMB609.1bn) of property were 
presold but unbooked as at end-19, providing solid earnings visibility. We 
expect full year contracted sales to be RMB650bn, up 3% YoY. 
 
Prudent land acquisition strategy in 2019. In 2019, Vanke acquired 147 
project with attributable GFA of 24.78mn sq m. Average land cost was 
RMB6,252 per sq m. As at end-19, attributable land bank under construction 
and for future planning were 61.70mn sq m and 33.6mn sq m, respectively. 
About 3% of land bank are located in Hubei. Sales suspension in Hubei has 
limited impact to its sales. 
 
Rental income and property management are shinning points. Rental 
income and revenue for property management increased by 55.6% to 
RMB4.77bn and 29.6% to RMB12.7bn in 2019, respectively. As at end-19, 
108 retail property projects with 9.0mn sq m under management in over 50 
cities were managed by SCPG. Vanke property management business had 
contracted and managed GFA of 640mn sq m and 450mn sq m respectively 
as at end-19. Vanke is one of the largest property management companies 
in China. 
 
Cut TP to RMB31.60. Net gearing ratio and cash/short term debt ratio were 
34.3% and 1.75x, respectively, as at end-19. The balance sheet was healthy. 
We cut earnings forecast by 6.7% to RMB44.7bn in 2020 and 4.9% to 
RMB51.1bn in 2021. In addition, we raise end-20 NAV forecast to RMB47.02. 
Based on 8.0x 20E P/E, our TP is changed from RMB33.92 to RMB31.60. 
Reiterate BUY.
