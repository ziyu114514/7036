Zoomlion’s net profit in 2019 came in at RMB4.38bn, up 116% Y0Y, within the 
profit growth range of 113-123% YoY released in the profit alert earlier. That said, 
the Company unexpectedly proposed not to pay dividend (compared with 98% 
payout in 2018), in spite of its strong operating cash flow. We believe such move 
aims at protecting balance sheet and offers flexibility to buyback outstanding 
bonds. We fine-tuned our 2020E/21E earnings forecast -5%/-2% on lower 
revenue assumptions. Our TP is revised down to RMB6.85, based on 1.2x 2020E 
P/B (down from 1.4x), on the back of 11.7%-12% ROE in 2020E-22E. Recovery 
of construction machinery demand in 2Q will serve as key catalyst.    
 Key highlights on 2019 results. The revenue growth in 2H19 was 50% YoY 
and gross margin expanded 1.3ppt YoY to 30% (stable HoH). However, S&D 
expense ratio increased to 9% in 2H19, compared with 8.3% in 2H18 and 8.4% 
in 1H19. Besides, R&D expense ratio increased to 5% in 2H19, up significantly 
from 2.7% in 2H18 and 2.1% in 1H19. We believe the higher expense ratio 
was due to the launch of new products. Thanks to lower finance expense and 
effective tax rate, net profit in 2H19 grew 55% YoY to ~RMB1.8bn.  
 Dividend cut reflects the conservative approach taken by the Company. 
We are surprised about the dividend cut as the Company generated strong 
operating cash flow of RMB6bn in 2019, though it spent RMB2.1bn on share 
buyback for employee share incentive scheme. The latest dividend policy 
suggested that the Company is potentially planning for debt repayment or 
redemption. Several tranches of bonds will be matured over the coming few 
years, with the first one in Dec 2022 (principal amount of US$600m with 
coupon rate of 6.13%). The recent volatile bond market due to the lack of 
liquidity may offer the Company with the opportunity to buyback at discount.           
 Risk factors: (1) Unexpected weakness on property construction activities; 
(2) Slow recovery of infrastructure spending; (3) High earnings volatility.
