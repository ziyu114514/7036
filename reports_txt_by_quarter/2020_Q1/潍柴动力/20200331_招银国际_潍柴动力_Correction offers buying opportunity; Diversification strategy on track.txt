Weichai’s share price has dropped 6% since the release of 2019 results. We 
see the correction a buying opportunity as we believe the growth drivers are 
well intact: (1) the inclusion of more Shandong SOEs under SHIG, parent 
company of Weichai, will help boost Weichai’s sales; (2) the diversification into 
non-road machinery engine is on track; (3) macro policy to support 
infrastructure spending should boost the demand for construction trucks. We 
trimmed our 2020E/21E earnings estimates by 7%/4% on lower margin 
projection and lower sales estimates on overseas business that operated by 
KION (KGX GR). Our SOTP-based TP is adjusted to RMB14.3 from RMB15.9.    
 Gross margin contraction should not be an ongoing trend. Gross 
margin in 4Q19 narrowed 3.2ppt YoY and 1.8ppt QoQ to 21.1%. 
Management explained that the reason for the lower margin in 4Q19 was 
due to a change in product mix. The strong sales of certain type of logistic 
trucks in China boosted the demand for Weichai’s WP10H product (which 
carried lower margin compared with that of the high margin 12L engines). 
That said, we do not expect a continuous margin contraction, given 
Weichai’s strong bargaining power on the back of consolidating industry.   
 More opportunities following the consolidation of Sinotruk and Lovol 
Heavy Industry by SHIG. In Oct 2019, SHIG was granted in Oct 2019 20.8% 
state-owned shares of Lovol Heavy Industry, a company that manufactures 
construction and agricultural machinery. This opens up a new opportunity to 
Weichai. Weichai targets to achieve annual sales of 100k units of 
continuously variable transmission (CVT) powertrain to Lovol in future. 
Meanwhile, given the consolidation and management reshuffle of Sinotruk 
have largely been completed, we expect Sinotruk will focus on sales volume 
growth going forward. Weichai targets to achieve annual sales of 100k-200k 
units of MDT and LDT engines in future. All these, together with the 
expansion in hydraulic powertrain and high-speed large-bore engine, will 
help Weichai achieve much higher level of diversification over the coming 
few years.  
 Risk factors: (1) weakness in HDT and engine demand; (2) further 
downside risk on overseas business; (3) technology risk.

Key takeaways from post-result conference 
Core business: 
 
About margin in 4Q19. Management explained the reason for the lower margin in 
4Q19 was due to a change in product mix. The strong sales of certain type of 
logistic trucks in China boosted the demand for Weichai’s WP10H product (which 
carries lower margin compared with that of the high margin 12L engines).   
 
Synergy effect will be seen following the corporate restructuring. Sinotruk 
(3808 HK, BUY) will increase the procurement of Weichai’s engine. Medium-duty 
trucks (MDT) and light-duty truck (LDT) will all be equipped with Weichai’s engines. 
The volume will potentially increase to 100k-200k units per year. However, such 
sales will not affect Sinotruk’s in-house production of MC11 and MC13 engines.  
 
Weichai believes HDT demand will be resilient over the coming 3-5 years. 
There are currently ~2mn units of NES III trucks in operation, which will be 
eliminated going forward. Besides, easing monetary policy will boost infrastructure 
spending this year, which will drive further demand.  
 
Hydraulic components for excavator industry. In China, there are ~100k units of 
excavator currently using imported hydraulic components (Total market size: RMB 
10b-15bn). Weichai has been actively expanding into this segment in order to 
achieve import substitution. Weichai will focus on hydraulic powertrain, with a key 
focus on 15t to 20t (or above). Weichai will leverage its advantage on the 
technology of electric motor, and believes it’s capable of achieving 50% market 
share in future.  
 
CVT powertrain. Weichai has been working on the development of CVT powertrain 
systems for agricultural tractors (150 horsepower or above). Lovol Heavy Industry, 
an agricultural equipment manufacturer (Weichai’s sister company), will procure 
100k units of agricultural engine from Weichai.  
 
High speed large-bore engine: The large-bore diesel engine market is currently 
dominated by the overseas manufacturers such as Caterpillar, Cummins, MTU 
Liebherr and Mitsubishi. Global market size reached 150-200k units, mainly in the 
overseas. Weichai is leveraging the technology of Baudouin (a French company 
acquired by Weichai 10 years ago) to expand into the large-bore high-speed engine 
segment.  
 
Revenue contribution from industrial engine. Weichai exported 20k units of 
industrial engine in 2019, and targets to achieve 40k units in 2020E. Weichai 
expects revenue contribution of 30-40% in 3-5 years.  
KION Group: 
 
In China, KION is shifting from high-end to mid-end to drive sales.  
 
COVID-19 will inevitably affect KION and Linde in the overseas market.  
Fuel cell battery commercial vehicles: 
 
Shandong province has abundant supply of hydrogen   
 
City public transportation / port vehicles are suitable to apply fuel cell battery 
technology.  
Long-term sales target:  
 
Engine: 2mn units 
 
Hydraulic powertrain: 100k units 
 
Gearbox: 2mn units 
 
Shaanxi Heavy Motor HDT: 200k units

R&D and capex: 
 
5% of revenue will be spent on R&D every year.  
 
Capex upcycle in the coming three years with an annual budget of RMB7bn. 
Dividend payout ratio: 
 
Dividend cut due to COVID-19 
 
Payout ratio will increase after COVID-19 under control 
 
 
2019 Results Highlights 
Weichai’s net profit in 2019 increased 5% YoY to RMB9.1bn, 6%/5% below 
our/consensus estimates. While revenue in 2019 is 2% above our expectation, the 
discrepancy came from a lower gross margin in 4Q19, which narrowed 3.2ppt YoY to 
21.1%.  
 
Sales volume growth in line with expectation. Total sales of engine / gear box 
grew 10.1% / 10.2% YoY in 2019. Sales volume of HDT increased moderately by 
5% to 161k units, above the industry average growth of 2%.  
 
Lower payout ratio expected. The proposed final dividend implies that the full year 
dividend payout ratio is 38%, down from 59% in 2018. This is expected as Weichai 
highlighted in the interim result that it would keep more cash for R&D and upcoming 
investment.  
 
Guidance for 2020E: As at end-2019, Weichai’s order on hand amounted to 
RMB38.4bn. Weichai targets to achieve 8% revenue growth in 2020E.
