We view PSBC as an excellent defensive play amid the challenging operating 
environment post COVID-19’s outbreak. Its extensive branch network and rich 
customer resource also provide a decent growth potential. Initiate coverage 
with BUY. 
 Solid funding base and asset optimization underpin a superior NIM. 
PSBC’s unique operation model of self-managed plus agency outlets grants 
easier access to cheap and stable deposit funding, which accounted for 95% 
of total liabilities. Cost advantage has enlarged its NIM premium over Big-5 
peers amid intensifying deposit competition since 2017. Although falling 
market rates appeared to weigh on PSBC’s margin due to its interbank net 
lender position, rising LDR and higher-yield consumption-related loans bode 
well for NIM outlook. The Bank is a key beneficiary to potential benchmark 
deposit rate cut. Our analysis indicates 10bp/5bp cut in time/demand deposit 
rates could boost FY20E NIM and earnings by 8.5bp and 3.0%, respectively. 
 Healthy asset quality outlook with a low-risk profile. PSBC has a decent 
set of asset quality indicators, including NPL ratio of 0.83%, provision 
coverage of 391%, and lowest SML/overdue loan ratio in the sector. The 
outstanding asset quality is mainly attributed to: 1) 54.3% proportion for retail 
loans, of which 61.5% was mortgage; 2) relatively short operating history, 
hence little legacy NPL issue from previous rounds of credit stimulus; and 3) 
limited exposure to risky industries. We expect PSBC's lower-than-peer NPL 
formation to sustain, even with the shock from COVID-19. 
 Extensive customer reach offers potential to enhance profitability. 
PSBC had total 39,680 branches as of 1H19, consisting of 7,945 self-
managed and 31,735 agency outlets. Total retail clients amounted to 589mn 
(vs 627mn for ICBC). We believe its vast branch network and rich customer 
resource are yet to be fully monetized. Improving branch service capability, 
deeper customer penetration, and technology utilization would be key drivers 
for profitability. Merely 6.6% revenue contribution from fee income in 1H19 
also implies huge upside for intermediary business. 
 Initiate with BUY rating and RMB 7.30 TP. We expect PSBC to deliver 
15.0%/12.8%/15.6% net profit growth in FY19-21E, 1-4% above consensus 
estimates. PSBC should enjoy a valuation premium over the Big-5, given its 
higher retail exposure, faster loan and earnings growth, more resilient NIM, 
and less asset quality risk. Our RMB 7.30 TP is based on GGM-derived 
target P/B of 1.16x and FY20E BPS of RMB 6.31.

Investment Highlights 
Solid funding base and asset optimization underpin a superior NIM  
PSBC’s extensive branch network enables it to easily absorb cheap and stable deposit 
funding. As of 1H19, deposits accounted for 95.1% of its total liabilities, vs 78.3%/67.0% 
for Big-5 and JSB. In particular, majority of PSBC’s branches are located in central and 
western China, where customers have weaker bargaining power and higher stickiness 
given less competition from banking peers. Therefore, the Bank was able to enjoy the 
lowest funding cost in the sector (1.56% vs 1.98%/2.48% for Big-5/JSB in 1H19). On 
asset side, loans only accounted for 45.2% of its total assets as of 1H19, but retail loans 
contributed to 54.2% of total loans. Hence, PSBC’s overall asset yield lies between that 
of Big-5 and JSB.  
PSBC’s NIM stood at 2.55% in 1H19, only trailed CMB’s (600036 CH, NR) 2.70% and 
PAB’s (000001 CH, BUY) 2.62% among nationwide banks. On the back of cost 
advantage, the Bank’s NIM advantage over Big-5 peers has been more prominent amid 
intensifying deposit competition since 2017. We believe faster NIM contraction in 1H19 
was mainly due to falling market rates and PSBC’s balance sheet structure as an 
interbank net lender. That said, it has trimmed interbank assets by 44.8% YoY as of 1H19. 
Continued lift in LDR and proportion of higher-yield consumption-related retail loans bode 
well for the Bank’s NIM outlook.

Given mounting economic pressure post COVID-19’s outbreak and recent US rate cut, 
there is rising expectation for PBoC to cut benchmark deposit rate, so as to create more 
space for banks to reduce loan rate. PSBC would be a key beneficiary to potential 
deposit rate cut, thanks to its high proportion of deposit funding. Our sensitivity analysis 
indicates: 1) 10bp cut in time deposit rate could boost the Bank’s FY20E NIM and 
earnings by 6.6bp and 2.3%; and 2) 10bp cut in time deposit rate plus 5bp cut in demand 
deposit rate could amplify the impact to 8.5bp and 3.0%, respectively.

Healthy asset quality outlook with a low-risk profile 
PSBC has a decent set of asset quality indicators, including: 1) NPL ratio of 0.83%, vs 
average 1.53% for banks under our coverage and 1.86% for China commercial bank 
sector as of 3Q19; 2) stringent NPL recognition, as NPL covered 124% of >90-day 
overdue loans as of 1H19; 3) the lowest SML and overdue loan ratio (leading indicators 
for NPL) of 0.67% and 0.97% as of 1H19; and 4) solid provision coverage of 391% as of 
3Q19. 
PSBC’s outstanding asset quality can be attributed to: 1) higher proportion of retail loans 
(54.3% of total loans as of 3Q19), offering greater risk diversification and lower cyclicality 
to economic downturn; 2) relatively late engagement in lending business thus did not get 
involved in the “Four trillion credit stimulus” in 2009 to tackle with the global financial crisis. 
Loans only accounted for 46.4% of total assets as of 3Q19, and the remaining was 
mainly bond investments and interbank assets; and 3) limited credit exposure to risky 
sectors, such as manufacturing, wholesale & retail, and commercial services.   
Thanks to its low-risk loan profile, PSBC's NPL formation ratio has been consistently 
below Big-5 and JSB. Among different categories of retail loan, only credit card and 
personal consumption loans saw an uptick in NPL ratio in 1H19 (+18bp/13bp HoH to 
1.85%/1.32% respectively). However, credit card and consumption loans only accounted 
for 4.3% and 10.8% of total retail loans as of 1H19. Therefore, we believe PSBC’s lower-
than-peers NPL formation could sustain, even with the shock from COVID-19.

Extensive customer reach offers great potential to enhance profitability 
PSBC’s strategic vision is to become the most trusted and valuable first-tier large retail 
bank. It had a unique operational model consisting of 7,945 self-managed and 31,735 
agency outlets, totaling 39,680 as of 1H19. Number of its retail clients reached 589mn, 
while ICBC (601398 CH, BUY) had 627mn, and two retail-focused JSBs, CMB and PAB, 
had 134mn and 90mn, respectively. However, we believe PSBC’s vast branch network 
and rich customer resource are yet to be fully monetized. For instance, number of credit 
card issued was equivalent to merely 5% of its retail client base (vs 25%/68%/62% for 
ICBC/CMB/PAB), and assets and profit per branch were notably below industry average.  
Transformation of branches, increasing revenue contribution through deeper customer 
penetration, and technology utilization would be key factors to enhance PSBC’s 
profitability. Specifically, the Bank has been focusing on expanding agency outlets’ 
service capability, which was primarily retail deposit and intermediary businesses. It 
kicked off a microfinance pilot program in six provinces in Jun 2019 and planned to 
extend to countrywide at later stage. The Bank spent 2.75% of FY18 revenue on IT 
investments and will raise the budget to 3.0%.  
PSBC’s revenue structure was relatively simple and mainly consisted of interest income 
from loans and investments. Net fee income only contributed 6.6% of total revenue in 
1H19 (vs sector average of 23.8%), implying huge growth potential for its intermediary 
business. The Bank’s fee income growth has been outpacing Big-5 and JSB since 2016. 
We believe bank card and wealth management businesses could be major drivers ahead.

Company Background 
History and business scale 
PSBC was established in Mar 2007, based on the reform of previous postal saving 
management system. The Bank was transformed into a joint stock limited liability 
company in Jan 2012. It was listed on Hong Kong Stock Exchange in Sep 2016 and was 
listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange in Dec 2019. PSBC ranked No.5 in total assets, No.6 
in total loans, and No.5 in total deposits among China’s commercial banks as of 3Q19.  
Figure 36: PSBC’s key operating indicators, market share, and industry ranking

Unique operational model  
As of 1H19, PSBC had 39,680 branches in total, consisting of 7,945 directly-operated 
outlets and 31,735 agency outlets under China Post Group. In terms of geographical 
distribution, the Bank had 11,935 branches in cities, 8,742 in counties, and 19,003 in rural 
areas, respectively. 
PSBC started retail banking by conducting micro loan business in 2007. It engaged in 
credit card and personal consumption loan business in 2008, and then launched 
corporate banking business in 2009. Due to its relatively younger age, loans only 
accounted for 46.4% of total assets as of 3Q19, notably lower than sector peers. On the 
other hand, deposit contributed to 95.5% of total liabilities, enabling the Bank to enjoy a 
significant funding cost advantage. PSBC’s cost of interest-bearing liabilities was 1.56% 
in 1H19, much lower than average 1.88% for Big-5.

Shareholding structure 
China Post Group, PSBC’s controlling shareholder, held approximately 64.2% of issued 
share capital after the Bank’s A-share listing. China Post Group principally engaged in 
domestic and international mail delivery, distribution of publications such as newspapers, 
journals and books, stamp issuance, postal remittance, confidential correspondence, 
postal financial business, postal express delivery, postal logistics, e-commerce, postal 
agency and other businesses conducted in accordance with law.  
In Dec 2015, PSBC introduced 10 strategic investors, including UBS, China Life, China 
Telecom, CPPIB, Ant Financial, JPMorgan, FMPL, IFC, DBS and Tencent. Cooperation 
with foreign shareholders and internet giants would improve the Bank’s operating 
efficiency and risk management, especially for consumer finance and technology

Earnings Forecasts 
Expect 7.9%/14.4% CAGR for revenue/net profit in FY19-21E  
We forecast PSBC’s revenue to grow 6.2%/8.4%/9.3% in FY19-21E, mainly driven by 
strong credit expansion (14-16% YoY) and rapid growth in fee income (15-20% YoY). 
Loan growth will outpace overall asset growth as the Bank gradually shifts asset 
allocation to loans from lower-yield bond investments and interbank assets. We expect 
CIR to decline as the Bank improve operating efficiency with branch transformation and 
technology utilization. Credit cost should soften given already stringent NPL recognition, 
solid provision buffer, and MoF’s consultation paper for banks to release excess provision. 
As such, we estimate net profit to grow 15.0%/12.8%/15.6% in FY19-21E, and ROE to 
pick up to 12.5%/13.2% in FY20/21E.  
NIM to narrow but more resilient than peers 
We forecast NIM to contract by 4bp/2bp in FY20/21E respectively, due to series of LPR 
cut and supportive credit policies to combat COVID-19. However, with relatively stable 
funding cost, rising LDR, and optimized loan mix, PSBC’s NIM should fare better 
compare to sector peers.   
NPL ratio is likely to rise yet still lowest in the sector 
China banks will likely face greater asset quality pressure in coming quarters, as 
corporate and individual borrower’s credit condition got worsened by COVID-19. We 
expect PSBC’s NPL ratio to pick up to 0.93%/0.95% in FY20/21E, mainly from 
impairment in MSE and credit card loans. That said, the Bank’s NPL ratio would remain 
significantly below sector average.

CMBI vs consensus estimates  
Our revenue forecasts are in line with Bloomberg consensus, but our net profit forecasts 
are 1-4% higher than market expectation. We believe this mainly reflects our relatively 
conservative stance on PSBC’s NIM, but more optimistic view on its non-interest income 
growth and credit cost trend. As such, our FY21E ROE forecast is 0.5ppt above 
consensus estimate.

Valuation And Recommendation 
Initiate with BUY rating and TP of RMB 7.30 
We use Gordon Growth Model to derive the TP for PSBC. Our key assumptions include: 
1) Market risk premium of 8.3%; 2) Risk free rate of 2.9%, 3) Sustainable ROE of 13.4%; 
and 4) Long-term growth rate of 3.0%. Our TP of RMB 7.30 is based on a target P/B of 
1.16x and FY20E BVPS of RMB 6.31.  
We believe PSBC should enjoy a valuation premium vs other state-owned banks, given 
its higher retail exposure, faster loan and earnings growth, more resilient NIM, and less 
asset quality risk.

Key Risks 
Risks related to macroeconomy  
China’s economic growth has been on a slowing path in recent years. The outbreak of 
COVID-19 increased market concerns on banks’ asset quality, especially for MSEs, 
which are more susceptible to macro downturn. PSBC’s outstanding MSE loans 
accounted for 13.0% of total loans as of 1H19, higher than sector peers. That said, the 
Bank does not have to follow PBoC’s guidance on targeted MSE loan growth for other 
stated-owned banks. Its solid provision coverage (391.1% as of 3Q19) and stringent NPL 
recognition (NPL to >90-day overdue loan was 123.6% as of 1H19) also offer a decent 
buffer against potential asset quality deterioration.  
Risks related to monetary policy  
China banks’ NIM is closely related to central bank’s monetary policies. PBoC has been 
gradually driving the interest rate liberalization in China. With the LPR reform started in 
Aug 2019, asset pricing is now more market-oriented than liability cost, thereby facing 
greater downside pressure during liquidity easing. Deposit funding, which accounted for 
95% of PSBC’s total liabilities, saw a more rigid cost trend than that of interbank funding. 
The agency fee scheme makes the Bank’s deposit cost less flexible than sector peers. 
PSBC may see less favourable NIM trend if market rates further decline, but potential 
repricing of the deposit agency fee would reduce the risk.  
Risks related to operating efficiency  
As of 1H19, PSBC conducted business through 7,945 directly-operated outlets and 
31,735 agency outlets, representing 20% and 80%, respectively. Agency outlets only 
perform deposit, settlement, and other agency financial services. The Bank pays agency 
fees for deposit taking and other intermediary businesses to China Post Group. Given 
limited business scope of the agency outlets, PSBC’s cost-to-income ratio is much higher 
than that of sector peers. The Bank is trying to empower agency outlets though piloting 
auxiliary microfinance business, but the sustainability and effectiveness remain to be 
seen.  
Risks related to industry competition  
China banks are facing multiple headwinds, including economic restructuring, regulatory 
intervention, and the rise of internet finance companies. These would result in 
deteriorating profitability for traditional commercial banks. As such, banks have been 
investing in financial technology and developing online product and service channels, so 
as to strengthen their ability to acquire customers. PSBC had 589mn retail customers as 
of 1H19. How to enhance service quality, effectively retain customers, and increase their 
per capital profit contribution would be key challenges.
