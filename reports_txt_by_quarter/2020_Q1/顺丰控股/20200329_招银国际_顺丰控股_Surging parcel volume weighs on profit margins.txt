SF Holding announced financial results for FY19. Revenue and adjusted net 
income were in line with expectations. We believe that the Company's strategy to 
leverage on e-commerce parcels to achieve economies of scale has leveled off. 
As price war escalates, the Company's self-operation model will weigh on its profit 
margins. We adjust TP up to RMB 47.79. The Company is currently trading at 
33.6x 2020E P/E, higher than peers. Downgrade to HOLD. 
 FY19 revenue and adjusted net income in line. In 4Q19, parcel volume 
increased 49.0% YoY, 26.2ppt above industry average. Annual parcel volume 
increased 25.1% YoY to 4.8bn, capturing a market share of 7.6%, flat YoY. 
For FY19, revenue increased 23.4% YoY to RMB 122.2bn, in line with 
expectations. Adjusted net income increased 27.2% YoY to RMB 5.8bn, in 
line with expectations. Adjusted EPS increased 66.3% YoY to RMB 1.31. Net 
cash generated by operating activities increased 68.1% YoY to RMB 9.1bn. 
 The surge in parcel volume caused decline in profit margin. The 
Company's gross profit in FY19 was RMB 19.5bn, with a gross profit margin 
of 17.42%, a decrease of 0.50ppt YoY. As percent of revenue, labor cost 
increased 0.41ppt YoY, transportation cost increased 0.20ppt YoY, and other 
operating costs decreased 0.10ppt YoY. We believe that the Company's 
strategy to leverage on e-commerce parcels to achieve economies of scale 
has leveled off. As price war escalates, the Company's self-operation model 
will weigh on its profit margins. 
 Catalysts. (1) Increasing revenue contribution of freight and supply chain 
businesses. In FY19, the Company's freight business recorded revenue of 
RMB 12.7bn, an increase of 57.2% YoY, and issued convertible bonds of 
US$ 300mn. With independent financing capability, the Company's freight 
business will develop rapidly. Revenue of the Company's supply chain 
business increased 11 times YoY due to consolidation of SF DHL since Mar. 
(2) Release of consumption demand as domestic epidemic eases. (3) Decline 
in oil prices. 
 Valuation. For FY20E, we expect the Company’s parcel volume will increase 
25% YoY, 5ppt above industry average. ASP will decrease 7% YoY and GPM 
will decrease 0.3ppt YoY. We forecast 2020E adj. EPS to increase 3.9% YoY 
to RMB 1.37. We adjust TP up to RMB 47.79. Our TP corresponds to 35x 
2020E P/E. The Company is currently trading at 33.6x 2020E P/E, higher than 
peers. Downgrade to HOLD.
