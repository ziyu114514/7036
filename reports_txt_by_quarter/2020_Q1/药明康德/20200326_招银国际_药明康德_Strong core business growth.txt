 
Core earnings slightly beat. WuXi AppTec reported FY19 revenue of 
RMB12.87bn, up 34% YoY, inline with our estimate. Non-IFRS net profit was 
up 38% YoY to RMB2.4bn, 4% above our estimate. Meanwhile, attributable 
net profit decreased 18% YoY to RMB1.9bn, 13% below our estimate, mainly 
due to the RMB107mn investments fair value loss and RMB98mn fair value 
loss from convertible loans. WuXi AppTec had 21,744 employees as of end-
2019, up 23% YoY. Fast expansion of staff team drives revenue growth given 
that the CRO/CDMO business is labor-intensive. Revenue contributed per 
employee rose 10% YoY to RMB0.65mn in FY19, indicating improving 
operating efficiencies. 
 
Phenomenal growth in CDMO and clinical services segment. In FY19, 
CDMO revenue grew 39% YoY to RMB3.8bn, contributing 29% of the total 
revenue. The CDMO business has strong pipelines with 21 commercialized 
projects, 40 Phase III projects, 117 Phase II projects and 756 early-stage 
projects. Revenue from clinical services increased 82% YoY to RMB1.1bn 
thanks to both high organic growth and additional contribution from 
acquisitions. WuXi AppTec will further look for overseas acquisition 
opportunities in clinical service area in order to enhance its global presence 
in clinical service industry. In FY19, China/US-based laboratory services 
delivered 27%/30% YoY growth, respectively. China/US-based laboratory 
services accounted for 50%/12% of the total FY19 revenue, respectively. 
WuXi AppTec acquried 1,200 new customers in FY19 while long-tail and 
domestic customers contributed 68% of the total revenue in FY19. 
 
Share placement to bring sufficient funding for future expansion. The 
Company plans to raise c.RMB6.5bn from placement of c.75mn new A shares 
and aims to place c.68.2mn new H shares. Total new issued shares will 
account for 8.67% of existing outstanding shares. Upon completion of the 
share issuance, WuXi AppTec will have rich funding for capacity expansion 
and overseas acquisitions, in our view. 
 
We lifted SOTP-based TP from RMB114.73 to RMB118.32 to reflect 
strong long-term growth outlook for WuXi AppTec. We forecast WuXi 
AppTec’s non-IFRS net profit to grow by 27%/30%/29% YoY in 
FY20E/21E/22E, respectively; and attributable net profit to increase 
54%/32%/31% YoY in FY20E/21E/22E. Moreover, WuXi AppTec 
maintained a diversified investment portfolio with 80+ companies and funds 
which will bring significant investment gains over the long term. 
 
Catalysts: 1) Higher-than-expected earnings growth, 2) Good acquisitions.
