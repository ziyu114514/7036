LONGi announced to acquire 100% equity of Ningbo Yize, which owns 3GW cell 
and 7GW module capacity in Vietnam. The transaction will be all cash, with initial 
consideration of RMB1.78bn with bet-on value adjustments based on FY19-21E 
earnings. We believe transaction valuation is less than 7x FY19 P/E. Considering 
potential ASP boost on LONGi’s module sales, we think the transaction is quite 
attractive. After due diligence, mgmt. expected to complete the transaction in Jul-
Aug 2020. After consolidation, we expect LONGi to seize more US module market 
shares, and to enhance its short-term profitability and long-term competitiveness. 
 Expansion speed is the key. The target Company, Ningbo Yize New Energy 
(宁波江北宜则新能源), controls 3GW PERC cell and 7GW bifacial half-cell 
module capacity in Vietnam, and specialized in providing OEM services to 
leading module brands in the past few years. According to mgmt., Ningbo Yize 
has state of the art PECR cell technologies, good costs structure and sufficient 
order backlog to support OEM production in 2020-21. Mgmt. explained 
expansion speed is the most critical consideration for initiating the deal, as 
acquisition will save LONGi at least 18 months of construction while CAPEX 
would be similar as acquisition costs.  
 Aiming at the US market. US solar module has significant pricing premium 
(82% higher vs. Europe) driven by ITC step down schedule (details explained 
in p.2-3). Additional capacity in Vietnam will help LONGi 1) boost module sales 
in the US; 2) avoid trade tariff from Section 301(25%) and AD/CVD(~4.1%); 
and more importantly, 3) bifacial mono c-Si may be exempt from Section 201 
tariff (20% in 2020). US panel shipment will significantly raise LONGi’s overall 
module sales ASP and profitability. Mgmt. intends to boost US module 
shipment from 1.1GW in 2019 to ~3GW in 2020. We estimate US shipments 
will increase overall module ASP by at least 5.8% in 2020. 
 Preferential payment terms with attractive valuation. The transaction has 
an initial valuation at RMB1.78bn, with adjustment mechanism based on 
FY19-21E earnings of RMB220/241/251mn respectively. Ningbo Yize had 
9M19 earnings of RMB248mn, implying valuation less than 7x FY19E P/E. 
With reference to benefits from US sales, we believe deal valuation is 
attractive, and we noticed the transaction would be settled at 30%/30%/40% 
in 2020-22 respectively, bringing no financing pressures to LONGi.  
 Enhancing market-leading position. We believe the transaction will 
accelerate LONGi’s capacity expansion pace in downstream module sales, 
and further enhance the Company’s profitability and leading position. We raise 
FY20-21E EPS estimates by 2.0%/3.8% to reflect the transaction’s impact, 
and our TP is also increased to RMB34.62 based on 21.5x FY20E P/E. 
Maintain Hold.

Pricing premium for US solar panels  
US module sales has significant pricing premium.  
We think the pricing premium is the key reason for LONGi to initiate this surprising 
acquisition. According to NREL’s 2Q/3Q 2019 Solar Industry Update, mono c-Si 
module was 52% higher in price than global average. The pricing premium in the 
US market is partially explained by Section 201 tariff (20% from Feb 2020 – Feb 
2021), while the remaining can be explained by strong US PV demand urged to 
qualify for the 30% Investment Tax Credit (ITC). According to PVinforlink, mono 
c-Si modules pricing premium is enlarged to 82.2% (US tariff incl. price: 
US$0.410/watt vs. Europe FOB price: US$0.225/watt).  
Figure 1: Comparison between trade tariffs on solar modules export to US 
market 
 
Source: US ITC, CMBIS  
What determines the premium? We think marginal supply.  Based on recent 
mono c-Si module pricing in different regions, we compare prices by reverting 
Section 201 tariff, and AD/CVD + Section 301 tariffs for module supplied from 
China. We found that US module pricing premium over average pricing in other 
areas could be largely explained by additional tariff charged on Chinese module 
exports. According to NREL’s estimates, by end-3Q19 there was 11-15GW 
bifacial mono c-Si capacity in Southeast Asia, less than consensus US module 
demand estimates of ~18GW.  We think marginal supply from China to the US 
market would continue to support pricing premium for US solar panel sales.

module-pricing premium

Pricing premium would largely sustain until 2021. As US solar ITC is following 
a step down with a sharp decline to 10% for commercial project and 0 to 
residential installation, we expect US PV installation will continue to expand in 
2020/21. Supported by the tax credit benefit, US pricing premium would largely 
sustain in 2020/21, in our view.
