证券研究报告
缘起深圳（摘要） 
高折价资产推动下一段估值修复 
作为中国新经济的创新中心，深圳积极的宏观前景和人口趋势令我们对本地房地产市场的长期前景信心十足。招商蛇口是招商局
旗下房地产业务的旗舰公司，致力于社区/园区/邮轮母港三大业务的开发运营，我们认为，较之其它大型开发商以及我们所研究
同业，招商蛇口因其最高的深圳资产占比（深圳在其土地储备/2017 年底预期净资产价值中的占比分别为45%/70%）而拥有实
现资产价值长期升值的最佳定位。由于公司在深圳的优质土地储备成本低且开发周期长，而且与招商局集团跨行业资源的潜在
资产整合有望带来增值空间，我们认为招商蛇口有望实现持续强于同业的盈利增长，并带来稳健的股东回报。 
市场过度担忧短期风险，长期增值空间犹存 
1.市场过度计入了深圳市场的周期性风险：在过去12 个月中招商蛇口股价较
内地上市开发商领先了14%，但年初至今止步不前，因为市场对于深圳楼市或
因“史上最严”调控令而走软的前景倍感担忧。目前招商蛇口的净资产价值折让
在我们所覆盖国内上市开发商中处于最大幅度（40% vs. 同业30%），我们认
为市场过度计入了深圳楼市或因政策而走软的担忧情绪。 
2. 近期经营层面积极向好：在倍受瞩目且开发周期较长的前海项目的权益分配
/太子湾项目的合作开发等方案上有了实质性进展；股权激励计划得以执行；
业绩快报好于预期。 
3.与母公司招商局存在更大规模的长期协同效应，有望通过城市更新改造、国
企资产整合以及邮轮母港开发等多种方式获取土地、继而开发多元化地产资产
组合，显著扩张盈利增长空间。 
借助植根深圳的优势 
深圳楼市在数次周期轮转中的表现一直领先于全国整体市场，而且在前一上行
周期中实现了最大的价格涨幅。因此，我们认为，虽然深圳楼市或将提早出现
较大幅度回调的不利因素可能给招商蛇口股价的市场情绪带来冲击，但我们认
为这将只是短期现象。 
撇除周期性波动，我们看好深圳房地产市场，并对房地产各个子行业的长期前
景持乐观看法，尽管不同细分领域依旧处在各自供应周期的不同阶段。我们预
计到2025 年深圳房地产市场的总资产价值将翻番至3.7 万亿美元，从而令扎根
深圳的招商蛇口成为一个主要受益者，并在执行得当的情况下拥有显著的市值
扩张潜力。考虑到招商蛇口土地储备的重估价值，以及基于深圳楼市量价变化
的净资产价值情景分析，我们认为招商蛇口当前的大幅净资产价值折让并不合
理。

Best-in-class land bank in SZ to drive fully-funded returns 
Leveraging its best-in-class land bank position in SZ and its shared resources and 
branding with China Merchants Group (CMG), we believe CMSK is poised to lead the long-
term sector growth in the region. Currently, CMSK has three areas of focus, namely community, 
industrial park and cruise homeport development, each accounting for on average 
84%/15%/1% of the topline in 2016E-2018E1. The company aims to become a leading 
community and industrial park developer and manager in China over the long term. 
We expect CMSK to own GFA44mn sqm land bank in total across 33 cities in China by end-
2016E, with SZ contributing over 30%-40% of 2017E-2019E presales, 45% of land bank 
(mostly in the Nanshan district, the emerging CBD), 45%-50% of 2016E-2019E earnings and 
70% of its end-2017E NAV (all highest among our coverage universe).

#1 SZ gives CMSK the edge: SZ is embarking on a new phase of economic transformation to 
become the innovation leader in China and in the world. As part of the ambition to turn SZ into a 
global gateway city and reinforce its position as the entrepreneur heartland of China in the coming 
decade, SZ’s government has undertaken major upgrades on infrastructure, healthcare and 
education. We believe the positive macro outlook (rising income and growing population to propel 
strong consumption and housing needs), coupled with world-class infrastructure, will be two key 
pillars supporting capital value appreciation for the SZ real estate market. Hence, developers with 
a strong presence in SZ are likely to benefit2. 
 
                                                                 
1 Note our forecast does not factor in any new acquisitions from now to end-2019E, which could render our 
2018 forecast conservative. We did not cite 2019 earnings forecast as we believe majority of growth in that 
year will need to be driven by acquisitions in 2017 and early 2018, in our flat yoy price change assumption 
from 2017E-2019E.

#2 Cost competiveness underpinning stronger return outlook: With cost advantage for its 
quality land bank in SZ (land cost 23% of 2017E ASP vs. our coverage average of 28%), we 
expect CMSK to deliver sector-leading EPS growth in 2016E-2018E (21% CAGR vs. 
peers’ average of 12%) and robust ROE (+2pp to 19% in 2018E from 2016E vs. peers’ average -
1pp to 15%) on the back of a well-protected margin (average 30% GPM in 2016E-2018E, 2pp 
above peers).

High P/B is not the full story; asset value overly discounted 
We apply a 30% target price discount to end-2017E NAV of Rmb28.1 to derive our 12-month 
target price of Rmb20.0 for CMSK vs. the range of 10% to 50% discount for the onshore 
coverage (or on average 30%). Our target price for CMSK implies a higher premium of 30% to 
our onshore sector TP-implied P/B & ROE trendline, vs. 20% premium its predecessor China 
Merchants Property (CMP (A), 000024.SZ, delisted) traded at during the last downturn in 2H13-
2014 to reflect CMSK’s improving ROE and lower than peers average leverage ratios (see Exhibit 
24 in Appendix). 
Post the merger with CMP in December 2015, we note that CMSK has been trading at higher P/B 
multiples than its predecessor CMP and an enlarged premium to onshore peers, which in our 
view are mainly attributable to: (1) its almost doubled land bank size through the asset 
integration with significantly boosted exposure to SZ (45% of land bank vs. 17% for 
CMP), but the book value has yet to fully factor in its future profit potential; (2) meanwhile 
the SZ assets (mainly Shekou, Prince Bay and Qianhai projects) were injected at 
below market price, therefore CMSK’s book value at cost has not fully reflected its intrinsic 
land bank value. We estimate that CMSK’s total land bank value, if marked to market, 
will be about Rmb401bn, almost double its original cost. 
As Exhibit 10 shows, despite trading at a premium to its book value, CMSK’s current share price 
of Rmb16.71 (Feb 17 closing) is at a deep discount to its reappraised land bank value and 
end-2017 GHe NAV (40% discount vs. onshore average of 30%), suggesting that property 
prices in prime locations are likely to fall more than those in average locations, which is unjustified 
and we believe the risk-reward is skewed to the upside. 
Exhibit 7: CMSK and its predecessor (CMP) have always 
been trading at higher P/B multiples than peers 
CMP (before 2016) and CMSK (after 2016) trailing P/B vs. 
onshore coverage average through the industry cycles

Strong balance sheet to fuel scale expansion 
Despite active land banking last year (land acquisition amounted to 114% of its presales or 72% if 
excluding the Shenzhen New Exhibition Center project jointly bided with OCT (000069.SZ) vs. 
coverage developers’ average of 56% in 2016), CMSK still preserves a healthy balance sheet 
due to its existing balance sheet strength (one of the sector’s lowest net gearing ratios at end-
2015) and strong sales performance last year (+28% yoy and beat management target by 14%). 
Together with its access to cheaper capital (as the sole real estate arm of a top SOE, i.e., 
CMG) and scope for value creation from potential asset integration with CMG’s cross-industry 
resources, CMSK stands out among peers to grow its asset portfolio through diversified land 
sourcing channels and is thus more likely to achieve solid growth in the midst of a sector 
downturn.

SZ market volatilities (S-T), execution in Qianhai/Prince Bay (improving) 
CMSK has outperformed onshore peers by 14% over the past 12 months, but its share price has 
plateaued recently. Based on our discussion with investors, their concerns are concentrated in 
two main areas: 
#1 Concentration risk in Shenzhen where stringent-than-ever tightening polices are in 
place (including strict presales permits and price control announced recently), and CMSK will be 
more vulnerable to any potential SZ property market volatilities. We note that during the past two 
industry downcycles, property prices corrected by 26%/12% from the peak to low (Aug-2007 to 
Feb-2009 and May-2011 to Feb-2012 respectively) in Shenzhen’s secondary market, while 
combined volumes in primary and secondary markets dropped 29%/45% yoy in 2008/2011 
downturns. We lay out below our sensitivity analysis by assuming ASP/volume would be 
30%/50% below our base-case assumptions to test the potential downside risks to our earnings 
and valuation estimates for CMSK (as Exhibits 15-16 show, earnings will be on average 20% 
lower for 2017E/2018E and 2017E NAV will shrink 15% in the bear case). 
Our view: 
Trading at a deepest discount to NAV for CMSK among our onshore coverage, we think the 
market has priced in an overly bearish view on the SZ property market outlook from a policy 
driven downturn and implies that property prices in prime locations are likely to fall more than 
those in average locations, which is unjustified as we do see more resilient ASP 
performances in the Nanshan district (where 83%/38% of CMSK’s SZ land bank/total land 
bank size is located) on the back of supply shortage and more promising economic growth 
outlook. 
 
Nanshan is the high tech industrial base, higher education center and logistics hub of 
Shenzhen and has the highest GDP as a single district in the Guangdong province. As 
shown in Exhibits 17-18, Nanshan is the most active market within four core districts (namely 
Futian, Luohu, Nanshan, Yantian) in SZ and its ASP performance has been more resilient 
during industry downcycles. 
 
Looking forward, we believe the positive macro outlook, coupled with world-class 
infrastructure will bolster a buoyant SZ local property market and support capital 
value appreciation over time. If ASPs were to increase 30% from 2016 levels3 and 
volumes were to rise 20% (back to the peak in 2009), our end-2017E NAV and average 
2017E-2018E earnings for CMSK would be boosted by 20%/25%. As such, we 
believe CMSK’s valuation risk/reward is skewed towards the upside.

#2 Execution slippage for Qianhai/Prince Bay sites development (accounting for 35% of 
its end-2017E NAV and average 20% of its 2017E-2019E presales). Given (1) the final 
consideration and detailed development plan is still under negotiation with the Qianhai local 
government, and (2) both are high profile and decade-long development projects for CMSK, any 
potential slower-than-expected progression of the land site conversion and/or development may 
adversely impact CMSK’s earnings visibility in the next few years. 
Our view: 
We have seen steady and meaningful progress in terms of CMSK’s development of the 
Qianhai/Prince Bay sites during the past few months: 
 
Qianhai site: The profit sharing framework has been achieved between CMG and the 
Authority of Qianhai on October 26, 2016 (on a 40%/60% basis) following their 
50%/50% interest split on June 18, 2016 to co-develop the Qianhai site. This should

remove the long-lasting overhang of benefit distribution between CMG and the 
government. 
 
Prince Bay site: CMSK disposed two land plots to New World Development (0017.HK) 
on December 8, 2016 (the implied land price is c.Rmb24k/sqm vs. CMSK’s original land 
cost of c.Rmb5k/sqm) and also introduced NWD to co-develop another two commercial 
projects in the Prince Bay site. We think by cooperating with an experienced 
investment property operator, CMSK will not only unlock its asset value but also 
expedite the development pace and further improve the project quality. 
 
Moreover, the share option incentive scheme (including 49mn shares, 0.62% of total, 
execution price of Rmb19.51, 17% higher than the current share price (as of 17 Feb) and 
covering 254 core members, 1.3% of total) announced in December 2016 shows 
management’s confidence in the promising growth trajectory for CMSK in the longer run. 
Under the plan, it has strict prerequisite exercising conditions on ROE (ROE excl. 
extraordinary gain/loss to be no less than 13%/14%/15% before the three exercising periods), 
net profit (3-year CAGR to be no less than 13%) and stock price (to be above IPO price 
Rmb23.34 for at least 10 trading days). We believe the strategic move could help better align 
the interests of its key employees (especially mid-level management and executive-level 
personnel) with the company’s growth, which indirectly addresses investors’ concern about 
the company’s earnings sustainability. 
 
On Jan 17, 2017, CMSK reported an upbeat profit alert for FY2016 with net profit up 92%-
102% yoy (or up 35%-42% vs. 2015 pro forma net profit) to Rmb9.3 bn-Rmb9.8 bn or EPS of 
Rmb1.18-Rmb1.24. Apart from the impact of the minorities interest arrangement in 2015-
2016 post restructuring, its earnings growth were mainly driven by: 1) 33% yoy rise in 
property sales booked; and 2) en-bloc sales of Nanhai E-cool and Qianhai Bay Garden in 
Shenzhen which monetized the land bank value. 
Major risks include: 1) Sales and margin miss on significant unexpected SZ market 
correction: We estimate our 2017E/2018E underlying profit will be affected by -11%/-29% if its 
SZ ASP/volume were to drop 30%/50% from 2016 levels (similar percentage drop from peak to 
trough in SZ during past downcycles); and 2) supply outpacing demand, exerting pressure 
on the rental outlook in SZ especially unsuccessful development of the SZ Free Trade 
Zone: As c.40% of CMSK’s valuation comes from rental properties (mostly office assets in SZ 
FTZ) for which we use the income capitalization approach to ascribe value, a 10% rental decline 
(vs. flattish rental growth in our base-case) and 1pp expansion of cap rate (vs. our base-case 
7.5%) will affect CMSK’s valuation by 12%. 
 
Long-term conviction in SZ, further asset integration with CMG 
Other than the impact from China’s housing cycles which drives developers’ stocks in a broader 
way, we find that the relative outperformance/underperformance of CMSK (or CMP before 2016) 
against peers is more significantly affected by the SZ local property market and scope for value 
creation from potential asset integration with CMG. 
1) Shenzhen the weather vane 
We expect headwinds from “strictest ever” tightening policies in SZ to remain until we see more 
meaningful price weakness. Any surprising market correction could nonetheless impact sentiment 
on CMSK but should be short-lived as we see the downturn in this cycle as more policy driven. 
Looking beyond short-term fluctuations, we prefer SZ’s housing market and remain bullish across 
all real estate sectors in the long term. We forecast the total capital value of SZ’s real 
estate market would double by 2025E and thus developers with a strong presence there 
look poised to become major beneficiaries.

2) Cultivating greater synergies with parent group 
We see further room for CMSK to explore a diversified portfolio of property assets within CMG’s 
cross-industry resources, and believe potential synergies have yet to be priced in. During recent 
years, CMG has been consolidating various business segments under its corporate umbrella, 
both internally and externally. We believe this presents ample opportunities for CMSK as it can 
now grow its asset portfolio through diversified land sourcing channels, such as land 
injection and conversion through SOE’s property asset consolidation and cruise town 
developments based on key port assets owned by CMG, thus serving as a line-up of 
potential catalysts.

Appendix 
China Merchants Group (CMG) is a century-old Chinese conglomerate and one of the top 
SOEs directly under the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the 
State Council (SASAC). Founded in the Westernization Movement in 1872, CMG has been 
pioneering China’s industry and business developments. In 1979, CMG as the sole investor 
promoted the establishment of “Shekou Industrial Zone”, making it one of the first zones in 
China to open up to the outside world. CMG possesses three core business segments: (1) 
transportation and related infrastructure; (2) finance; and (3) property (zones development, real 
estate). As of end-2015, CMG’s total assets amounted to Rmb6.4tn (or Rmb660bn owners’ equity) 
and it generated total revenues of Rmb281bn with total profits of Rmb82.6bn, ranking #3 among 
all central SOEs. CMG has stakes in 29 listed subsidiaries in Mainland China, Hong Kong and 
Singapore. 
China Merchants Shekou Industrial Zone Co., Ltd. (CMSK) was listed on Dec 31, 2015, 
post asset restructuring across the property development business of China Merchant 
Properties (000024.SZ; founded in 1984 and delisted in Dec 2015; it is one of the oldest real 
estate companies in China and now constitutes the main body of CMSK’s real estate 
business), the industrial park development business and the cruise homeport development 
business. CMSK is now 71.28% owned by parent CMG and is the latter’s onshore-listed real 
estate flagship. CMSK also owns 74.35% of China Merchants Land (0978.HK; Not Covered), 
which is the group’s sole offshore-listed real estate vehicle.

Exhibit 27: China developers’ valuation comparison 
 
Note: (1) *denotes the stock is on our Conviction List. (2) Our 12-month target prices are based on end-2017E NAV for our coverage universe except for RSM which is based on SOTP. Exceptions include Greentown, Poly 
(H), for which our TP is a blend of our fundamental valuation (based on end-2017E NAV) and M&A value. We derive M&A value based on the mean multiple implied by recent M&A deals, with the multiple adjusted for a 
premium/discount (P/B-ROE vs. sector), detailed in our report “Poly H: Assessing asset value crystallization from possible M&A; up to Buy” published Feb 3, 2017. (3) Average P/E does not include SOHO, Poly (H), Joy City 
and Shui On Land, which are outliers.

投资摘要 
投资摘要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与其行业和市场相比较来评价该股的投资环境。所描述的四个主要指标包括增长、回报、估值倍数和波动性。增长、
回报和估值倍数都是运用数种方法综合计算而成，以确定该股在地区研究行业内所处的百分位排名。  
每项指标的准确计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法如下：  
增长是下一年预测与当前年度预测的综合比较，如每股盈利、EBITDA 和收入等。 回报是各项资本回报指标一年预测的加总，如CROCI、平均运用资本回报率
和净资产回报率。 估值倍数根据一年预期估值比率综合计算，如市盈率、股息收益率、EV/FCF、EV/EBITDA、EV/DACF、市净率。 波动性根据12 个月的历史
波动性计算并经股息调整。  
Quantum 
Quantum 是提供具体财务报表数据历史、预测和比率的高盛专有数据库，它可以用于对单一公司的深入分析，或在不同行业和市场的公司之间进行比较。  
GS SUSTAIN 
GS SUSTAIN 是侧重于长期做多建议的相对稳定的全球投资策略。GS SUSTAIN 关注名单涵盖了我们认为相对于全球同业具有持续竞争优势和出色的资本回
报、因而有望在长期内表现出色的行业领军企业。我们对领军企业的筛选基于对以下三方面的量化分析：现金投资的现金回报、行业地位和管理水平（公司管
理层对行业面临的环境、社会和企业治理方面管理的有效性）。

公司评级、研究行业及评级和相关定义 
买入、中性、卖出：分析师建议将评为买入或卖出的股票纳入地区投资名单。一只股票在投资名单中评为买入或卖出由其相对于所属研究行业的潜在回报决定。
任何未获得买入或卖出评级的股票均被视为中性评级。每个地区投资评估委员会根据25-35%的股票评级为买入、10-15%的股票评级为卖出的全球指导原则来
管理该地区的投资名单；但是，在某一特定行业买入和卖出评级的分布可能根据地区投资评估委员会的决定而有所不同。地区强力买入或卖出名单是以潜在回
报规模或实现回报的可能性为主要依据的投资建议。  
潜在回报：代表当前股价与一定时间范围内预测目标价格之差。分析师被要求对研究范围内的所有股票给出目标价格。潜在回报、目标价格及相关时间范围在
每份加入投资名单或重申维持在投资名单的研究报告中都有注明。  
研究行业及评级：分析师给出下列评级中的其中一项代表其根据行业历史基本面及／或估值对研究对象的投资前景的看法。 具吸引力(A)：未来12 个月内投资前
景优于研究范围的历史基本面及／或估值。 中性(N)：未来12 个月内投资前景相对研究范围的历史基本面及／或估值持平。 谨慎(C)：未来12 个月内投资前景
劣于研究范围的历史基本面及／或估值。  
暂无评级(NR)：在高盛高华于涉及该公司的一项合并交易或战略性交易中担任咨询顾问时并在某些其他情况下，投资评级和目标价格已经根据高华证券的政策予
以除去。 暂停评级(RS)：由于缺乏足够的基础去确定投资评级或价格目标，或在发表报告方面存在法律、监管或政策的限制，我们已经暂停对这种股票给予投
资评级和价格目标。此前对这种股票作出的投资评级和价格目标(如有的话)将不再有效，因此投资者不应依赖该等资料。 暂停研究(CS)：我们已经暂停对该公司
的研究。 没有研究(NC)：我们没有对该公司进行研究。 不存在或不适用(NA)：此资料不存在或不适用。 无意义(NM)：此资料无意义，因此不包括在报告内。
