BoCom’s net profit declined 30.6%/14.6% YoY in 2Q/1H20, despite a solid 
revenue growth of 6.6%/5.2% YoY. Notable earnings contraction was mainly due 
to mounting provisions (+99.2% YoY in 2Q20) against deteriorating asset quality. 
The Bank is following policy guidance to pile up risk reserves, and conceded total 
RMB14bn profit to the real economy during anti-COVID-19 campaign in 1H20. 
Although NPL formation may ease in 2H20, credit cost is likely to stay elevated 
given lower-than-peers provision coverage, further weighing on earnings growth.    
 Results positives: 1) Loan/deposit growth was healthy at 2.9%/3.1% in 
2Q20. Majority of new loans went to corporate side (+9.9%) in 1H20, but 
management said retail loan extension started to accelerate in 2Q20 and 
should account for more than 40% of full-year loan growth. 3) Non-interest 
income was up 8.8% YoY, driven by management service fees and 
investment gains. 3) Wealth management business capacity enhanced, 
with retail AUM +8.2% HoH, no. of OTO fortune customers +8.5% HoH, and 
private banking clients +13.3% HoH.    
 Results negatives: 1) NIM narrowed 3bp QoQ/5bp YoY to 1.52%/1.53% in 
2Q/1H20. Due to LPR cuts, asset yields shrank faster than liability cost in 
1H20. In particular, loan yield dropped 17bp HoH, but deposit cost only slid 
1bp HoH. Management expected further margin pressure in 2H20, but will try 
to stabilize NIM by replacing higher-cost structured deposits/MLF with 
cheaper interbank funding. 2) Asset quality worsened. NPL ratio edged up 
9bp QoQ to 1.68%, and provision coverage declined 5.5ppt QoQ to 148.7%. 
This was partly due to more prudent NPL recognition, as SML ratio retreated 
38bp HoH. The good news is that credit card NPLs peaked out in Jun and will 
likely recovered to pre-pandemic level in 3Q20. Loans under deferred 
repayment scheme amounted to RMB176bn, 3.1% of total loans as of 2Q20. 
3) 2Q20 cost-income ratio rose 0.4ppt YoY to 36.2%, higher than large 
bank peers. 4) Capital position weakened, as CET1 ratio dropped 20bp QoQ 
to 10.63% on sluggish earnings and cash dividend payout. 
 Maintain HOLD and trim TP to RMB5.40. We cut our FY20/21E earnings 
estimates by 14-16%, to factor in lower NIM/fee income and higher credit cost 
assumptions. Our revised RMB5.40 TP is based on 0.55x (from 0.62x) target 
P/B and FY20E BVPS of RMB9.9.
