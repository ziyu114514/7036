We upgrade Goertek to BUY (from Hold) as we turn more positive on its product 
pipeline of AirPods Pro/Studio and Oculus Quest/PSVR in FY20/21E, backed by 
TWS/wearables upcycle, capacity expansion and impressive yield improvement.  
We expect 2H20E/FY21E net profit to grow 118%/ 51% YoY, and our FY21/22E 
EPS are 19%/13% above consensus. Our new TP of RMB46 is based on 40x 
FY21E P/E, in-line with 1-sd above 5-yr average P/E, given 35% FY20-22E EPS 
CAGR, strong earnings visibility and improving ROE. Near-term catalysts include 
product launches of AirPods Studio, HomePod 2 and Oculus Quest2 in 2H20E. 
 TWS: AirPods momentum, share gains and improving margin. We are 
positive on Goertek’s leading market position and growth outlook of its 
AirPods/TWS segment. We estimate AirPods shipment will grow 45%/22% 
YoY to 94mn/115mn in FY20E/21E, and Goertek will gain share allocation 
from 20% in FY19 to 23%/37% in FY20/21E. In addition, we expect improving 
product mix and production yield to drive earnings upside in after new 
production lines of AirPods Pro commerce operations in 3Q20E. 
 VR/AR: Oculus Quest and Sony PSVR to boost growth. Goertek is global 
pioneer in VR/AR industry since partnership with Oculus and Sony in 2014. 
We expect Goertek to start shipment of Oculus Quest series in 2H20E, and 
VR/AR segment will regain traction with 82%/40% YoY growth in FY20/21E, 
backed by new product cycle from Oculus Quest 2 and Sony PSVR 2. In 
addition, Goertek recently announced to raise RMB4bn convertible bond to 
expand capacity for 28.6mn TWS earphones, 3.5mn VR/AR products and 
5mn AR/VR optical modules, which will help boost share gain and drive 
revenue growth in FY20-21E. 
 Upgrade to BUY with new TP of RMB46. We revised up our FY20-22E EPS 
by 27-51%, mainly to reflect our more positive view on AirPods 
shipment/margin upside given strong consumer demand and cancellation of 
in-box earphones in iPhone 12 in 2H20E. Our FY21/22E EPS are 19%/13% 
above consensus, and our TP of RMB46 is based on 40x FY21E P/E, in-line 
1-sd above its 5-yr average P/E, given 35% FY20-22E EPS CAGR, strong 
earnings visibility and improving ROE. Near-term catalysts include product 
launches of AirPod Studio, HomePod 2 and Oculus Quest2 in 2H20E.
