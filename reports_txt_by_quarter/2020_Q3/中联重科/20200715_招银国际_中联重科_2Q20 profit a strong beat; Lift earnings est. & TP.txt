Zoomlion released a positive profit alert yesterday, stating that net profit in 1H20E 
will reach RMB3.8-4.2bn, representing 47-63% YoY growth. This is a surprise as 
the earnings range implies 75-100% YoY growth in 2Q20E. We raise our 2020E-
22E earnings forecast significantly by 24-42% (14-27% above consensus), and 
lift our TP to RMB9.56. We see Zoomlion entering into a new growth trajectory, 
driven by the solid upcycle of concrete machinery and tower crane, as well as the 
aggressive expansion into attractive sub-segments such as excavator, aerial 
working platform (AWP) and hydraulic components. Near term catalysts include 
earnings revision by the market and strong machinery demand in 3Q. Reiterate 
BUY.     
 New assumptions. The strong earnings growth in 1H20 was driven by strong 
demand for concrete pump truck, tower crane and construction crane, as well 
as the lower expense ratio thanks to the operating leverage and stringent cost 
control. We revise up our revenue and margin forecast in 2020E-22E. Our 
new forecast includes the potential dilution effect arising from the share 
placement and the new capacity expansion plan released by the Company 
last week.       
 Attractive valuation (9.8x 20E P/E) suggests significant upside potential. 
We switch our valuation methodology from asset-based to earnings-based 
approach, in order to better capture the robust earnings growth outlook. Our 
new TP of RMB9.56 is based on 12x 2020E P/E (previously RMB6.85 based 
on 1.2x 2020E P/B). In 2011, the year when Zoomlion’s earnings reach a 
historical high of RMB8.3bn, the stock traded at a valuation range of 10-12x 
despite the high earnings base. We benchmark our target multiple (12x) to 
such valuation. We believe our target is not aggressive, given our EPS growth 
estimate of 37%/18% in 2020E/21E.   
 Risk factors: (1) Unexpected weakness on infrastructure spending; (2) Slow 
recovery of property construction; (3) Risks of new business expansion.

Share placement plan a positive  
Last week, Zoomlion announced a non-public share placement plan. Zoomlion will issue a 
maximum of 1.25bn new shares (A-share) to four strategic investors, raising up to 
RMB6.6bn. 
  
Details: 
 
The four strategic investors are Huaijin Cornerstone, Taiping Life Insurance, Hainan 
Chengyisheng and Ningbo Shituo. The lock-up period is 18 months. 
 
The new shares will account for 15.8% of the existing o/s shares. The issue price is 
RMB5.28.  
 
The capital will be spent on four areas: (1) intelligent manufacturing project for 
excavators; (2) capacity upgrade on concrete mixers; (3) key components intelligent 
manufacturing project; (4) intelligent manufacturing project of key hydraulic parts 
(hydraulic valves). 
 
The share placement plan is subject to the approval of shareholders and CSRC.    
   
Analysis: 
The share placement plan will help remove the overhang as market had expected a fund-
raising exercise. We see several positives in the share placement plan:   
  
 
First, the strategic investors have strong background. In particular, Hainan 
Chengyisheng is held as to 24.48%, 6.49% and 6.49% by Zhan Chunxin (executive 
Director of Zoomlion), Qin Xiuhong (senior manager) and Yang Duzhi (senior manager), 
respectively, each as a limited partner. The subscription of shares by senior 
management should enhance market confidence. 
 
Second, the lock-up period of 18 months is long, which should not exert pressure on 
the share price in the foreseeable future. 
 
Third, the new business areas are attractive with good potential of import substitution, 
offering new growth drivers to Zoomlion. Zoomlion estimates that the IRR of the four 
projects will range from 22% to 28%.
