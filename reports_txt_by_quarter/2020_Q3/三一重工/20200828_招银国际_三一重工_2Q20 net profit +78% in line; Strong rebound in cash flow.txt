SANY’s net profit in 1H20 came in at RMB8.5bn, up 25.5% YoY. Net profit in 
2Q20 surged 78% YoY to RMB6.3bn. In particular, operating cash inflow 
significantly rebounded to RMB9.4bn in 2Q, versus an outflow of RMB895mn in 
1Q. While we fine-tuned our 2020E earnings forecast by -5% due mainly to lower 
assumption on the concrete machinery sales and the blended gross margin, we 
slightly raised our 2021E-22E earnings forecast by 1%, as we expect further 
operating cost reduction. We raised our TP from RMB24.7 to RMB26.4, based 
on 16x 2020E P/E (up from 14.3x), on the back of 16% estimated earnings growth 
in 2021E. SANY remains the key beneficiary of strong infrastructure spending 
growth and strict emission control policies. Reiterate BUY.  
 Key highlights on 1H20 results. Revenue grew 13% YoY to RMB49bn, 
driven mainly by a 17% YoY increase in excavator revenue. Revenue from 
concrete machinery sales only increased by 5% YoY, slightly below our 
expectation. Gross margin narrowed by 2ppt YoY to 30.3%, which was largely 
due to the impact of COVID-19 in 1Q. SANY maintained a stringent expense 
control in 1H20, with S&D expense ratio reduced by 1.8ppt YoY. SANY 
maintained its R&D spending growth which we believe is essential for 
enhancing its long-term competitiveness. Net profit grew 25.5% YoY to 
RMB8.5bn.     
 Sharp recovery in 2Q20. Revenue grew 45% YoY to RMB32bn in 2Q, a 
significant improvement from a decline of 19% in 1Q. While the gross margin 
was down 2.4ppt YoY to 31.5%, it improved 3.3ppt QoQ. All these, together 
with the increase in other gains and finance income, boosted net profit growth 
of 78% YoY (to RMB6.3bn) in 2Q compared with a decline of 32% YoY in 1Q. 
In particular, the operating cash inflow reached RMB9.4bn, suggesting 
excellent cash flow management.    
 High visibility on the 2H20E outlook. According to CCMA, excavator sales 
volume (for the industry as a whole) grew 55% YoY in Jul. In addition, based 
on Jiangsu Hengli’s (601100 CH, BUY) latest order intakes of hydraulic 
cylinders, we expect the momentum of excavator demand to continue over 
the coming months. Besides, we expect the concrete machinery sales growth 
to accelerate in 2H20E on the back of the recovery of property construction.    
 Key risks: (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic; (2) Slowdown of 
construction activities; (3) Risk of expanding to financing business.
