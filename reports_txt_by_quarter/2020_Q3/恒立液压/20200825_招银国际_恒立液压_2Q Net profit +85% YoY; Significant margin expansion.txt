Hengli’s net profit in 1H20 grew 47% YoY to RMB986mn, implying an impressive 
net profit growth of 85% YoY in 2Q. Gross margin of 44.5% in 2Q is a record high, 
suggesting high utilization rate and strong pricing power. We revised up our 
earnings forecast in 2020E-22E by 5-8% (12-15% above consensus), after 
incorporating higher gross margin assumption and lower expense ratios. After 
rolling over the valuation base to 2021E, we raised our TP to RMB82 based on 
unchanged multiple of 45x P/E. We believe the fast-growing pump and valve 
sales will continue to lend support to the valuation. Maintain BUY. 
 Key highlights on 1H20 results. Revenue grew 24% YoY to RMB3.46bn and 
gross margin significantly expanded 4.9ppt YoY to 41.9%. This, coupled with 
lower SG&A ratios, boosted the net profit growth of 47% YoY. Operating cash 
inflow in 1H20 increased by 19% YoY to RMB944mn. In 2Q20, net profit 
surged 85% YoY to RMB639mn, mainly driven by 71% YoY increase in 
revenue and 4.6ppt YoY gross margin expansion (to 44.5%).  
 Solid sales growth in 1H20. Sales volume of hydraulic cylinder for excavator 
grew 27% YoY 330k units. The segment revenue grew 16% YoY to RMB1.4bn, 
a result of lower ASP due to higher demand for small-size excavators. 
Hydraulic Technology, the major subsidiary with a focus on hydraulic pump 
and valve, reported revenue growth of 86% YoY. Revenue of non-
standardized hydraulic cylinders dropped 9% YoY to RMB577mn.   
 Production volume staying high in Jul & Aug. Based on our understanding, 
Hengli’s monthly production volume reached 53k units in Jul and is expected 
to reach 54k units in Aug. Such monthly volume suggests strong downstream 
demand. Besides, production volume of pumps and valves are expected to 
stay high in 3Q.  
 Key risks: (1) Slowdown of construction activities; (2) risk of overseas 
expansion; (3) increase in raw materials cost.
