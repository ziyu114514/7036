Prompted by government policy and technological innovation, China's NEV 
market is expected to enter into a rapid growth period with CARG of 43% in 2020-
25E. As the pioneer in the NEV field in China, BYD was ranked No.1 in 
NEPV/No.4 in NECV in 2019. We believe that the Company will maintain its 
excellent performance thanks to its technological advantages and brand 
recognition in the future. The Company is experiencing a re-rating process as 
supply chain open up activities help release value from power battery and IGBT. 
We believe the re-rating is yet to finish. We initiate BUY with SOTP-derived TP 
of RMB112.12 per share.  
 China NEV industry to usher rapid growth from 2021E. We forecast that 
NEV sales volume will achieve 1.7mn units in 2021E, an increase of 66% YoY, 
supported by favorable policies such as the extension of subsidies/the 
implementation of the double credit policy. BYD, as the undoubted leader in 
China's NEV field, launched its blade battery early this year and will 
subsequently launch its DM4.0 platform in 4Q20E, supporting NEV sales 
growth. We expect its total vehicle sales (ICE and NEV) to increase by 34% 
YoY in 2021E. The corresponding revenue from the auto segment will achieve 
an increase of 47% YoY to RMB83.3bn in 2021E. 
 Blade Battery: a potential game-changer. BYD recently launched blade 
battery and the first model (Han) equipped with blade batteries. While 
ensuring safety, the blade battery extends the mile range, broadening the 
application scenarios of traditional LFP. BYD is now actively developing the 
2nd generation of blade batteries with improving costs and energy density. 
We believe that the external shipment of the power battery will have a brilliant 
potential since 2021E. We think incremental income from battery external 
shipment will significantly lift BYD's overall valuation. We expect NP from 
power battery business will achieve a CAGR of 161% through 2021E to 2025E. 
 Semiconductor: a new shining point from BYD’s supply chain. BYD 
introduced 30 strategic investors into IGBT semiconductor business in Jun 
2020 with a post investment valuation of RMB10.2bn. By far, BYD holds 72.3% 
equity of IGBT business. We are optimistic about its IGBT business given its 
import substitution potential in China’s NEV supply chain. We expect NP from 
IGBT business will achieve a CAGR of 68% through 2021E to 2025E. 
 We are optimistic about the future growth potential of BYD and initiate 
BUY rating with TP of RMB112.12 (26.0% upside potential).

Why shall we focus on NEV now? 
NEV market has enormous growth potential 
We see enormous growth potential of the NEV market in China. NEV market in China 
is shaped under the backdrop of energy structure transformation with an aim to achieve 
leapfrog development of the China auto industry. China NEV market was initially promoted 
through heavy subsidy and experienced some disruptions due to government policy 
changes. Entering into 2020, we think the market is getting mature, since 1) China has 
formed the world’s largest consumer market for NEV; 2) NEV cost has experienced 
continuous decline and is about to reach cost-parity line by 2023E; 3) government policy 
has laid a solid foundation, turning from subsidy driven towards non-monetary long-term 
development mechanism; and 4) NEV upgrade to high-end car model will bring more 
competitions and opportunities. We project NEV sales volume in China to reach CAGR of 
43.4% in 2020-25E, with reference to the Chinese government’s ambitious 25% NEV 
penetration target by 2025E. We think the room for future development of NEV is huge. 
A leapfrog strategy to tackle energy transformation and air pollution 
Three main considerations have jointly formed the development strategy of China's NEV 
industry. 1) From the perspective of energy structure, China's oil import volume is the 
highest in the world with a dependence ratio of 72%, which affects China's energy security； 
2) the serious pollution of fuel vehicles is becoming a demanding issue for Chinese society; 
and 3) NEV development creates a leapfrog opportunity for China auto industry.  
Subsidy bridge through the path to the world’s largest NEV consumer market 
China has ranked No.1 globally in terms of both NEV production and sales for four 
consecutive years since 2015. The achievements were highly dependent on policy support, 
however, which as a subsidy to the NEV manufacturers has lowered retail price, helping 
boost end-users demand.   
In the early stages of the development of NEV, we observe the government has expanded 
demand through industrial policies including fiscal subsidies, purchase tax reductions, and 
restriction exemption. Since 2019, government has gradually withdrawn direct subsidy 
while shifting the support from the production side to the user side. The government hopes 
that the NEV industry can form its own competitiveness competent with ICE and achieve a 
healthy development in the long run without any government support. 
We estimate the central and local governments have provided a total of RMB200-300bn 
subsidies for NEV industry in the past decade. In 2016, the MoF exposed the fraudulent 
acts of NEV companies, which caused the government to gradually reduce subsidies from 
2017. The adjustment on the subsidy policy has made NEV sales somewhat bumpy in the 
past two years. However, China still realized NEV sales of 1.062mn units in 2019, 
accounting for more than 50% of NEV sales of the global market.

NEV market is turning from subsidy-driven towards non-monetary policy tools  
As the domestic NEV market grew relative large enough to support its own development, 
the government hopes to gradually reduce market intervention. In Jul 2018, China officially 
relaxed the restrictions on foreign corporation of setting up NEV companies in China. As a 
result, global NEV leader such as Tesla (TSLA US) started to set up factory in China. By 
cutting subsidy supports and introducing competition, the Chinese local NEV companies 
will be forced to accelerate innovation. In the near future from 2021E, non-monetary policy 
tools such as “CAFC and NEV credit regulation”, will further foster competition and 
therefore support the development of the NEV industry. We expect China’s NEV market to 
experience a market clearance phase, while China NEV OEMs will likely to face increasing 
challenges. As the market expands and competition becomes more orderly, we think 
leading players will benefit from the shifting competitive landscape. 
Cost reduction is the most critical factor in NEV industry 
Subsidy cuts substantially amplify the pressures of cost reduction in the NEV industry. The 
essence of the industry is to continuously improve cost structure through technology 
advancement and the economies of scale brought by growing demand. 
The manufacturing cost of NEV includes three major electric components (namely battery, 
motor, and electronic control), automotive electronics, body, chassis suspension, interior 
decoration, etc. Among them, batteries, motors and electronic controls constitute three 
major components in the NEV industrial chain. In 2019, power batteries accounted for 
about 40% of vehicle manufacturing costs. In other words, the cost of the power battery will 
directly affect the manufacturing cost of NEV. Therefore, the cost reduction pace of power 
battery directly determines the future development speed of NEV. Given 1) increasing 
economies of scale with growing demand; 2) the improvement in the first-pass yield due to 
the improvement of production technology; and 3) an expected cost reduction in raw 
material, we expect that the unit cost of the battery would continue to decline.  
According to GGII, the price of power batteries has been declining at an annual rate of 
about 20% in past 5 years. At the end of 2019, the ex-VAT price for the ternary battery 
system(pack) was RMB0.95-1.05/Wh while the price for the LFP system(pack) was 
RMB0.85-0.95/Wh. It is expected that the ternary battery pack ex-VAT price will drop below 
RMB0.90/Wh while the LFP pack ex-VAT price will drop below RMB0.8/Wh in 2020E. 
Based on a diminishing path of battery cost, we estimate the costs parity to ICE can be 
reached as early as 2023E.

Government policy laid a solid foundation for long-term development  
The Chinese government has provided enormous support from the very beginning of the 
NEV development in the country. In Sep 2001, MIIT has set up a special project for EV 
within the national "863" plan during the "Tenth Five-Year Plan" period. However, we 
observe that the first rapid growth period of the China NEV industry began in 2012. Since 
the "Energy Saving and New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2012-2020) 《节
能与新能源汽车产业发展规划（2012—2020 年）》" was issued by the State Council and 
implemented in 2012, China NEV market has entered into a new phase.  
Going forward, we think recent government policies laid a solid foundation to drive the NEV 
industry’s sustainable growth. For the near term, MIIT official just extended the financial 
subsidy for NEV by three years to end-2022 on 23 Apr 2020. For the longer-term, MIIT 
released the "New Energy Vehicle Industry Development Plan (2021-2035)" (draft for 
comments) on 3 Dec 2019,. According to the "Plan", China will set an ambitious target to 
have NEV/Intelligent connected vehicles(ICV) sales volume accounting for 25%/30% of 
total vehicle sales by 2025E. On 23 Jun 2020, a new version of “CAFC and NEV credit 
regulation” was published, with rigorous mechanism designed to promote the future growth 
of the NEV industry and to underpin the 2025E target.

NEV to break through to high-end vehicles  
We believe Year 2020 will become a starting point for NEV upgrade. The proportion of 
A00-class NEV sales has begun to decline since 2017. Sales penetration rate of the A-00 
class NEV declined from 54% in 2017 to 18% in 2019. Meanwhile, the proportion of A-class 
NEV sales gradually increased from 36% in 2017 to 51% in 2019. Market share of B/C-
class NEV cars also rose from 4%/0% in 2018 to 13%/3% in 2019. The breakthrough of 
NEV towards high-end vehicles reflects that consumers have begun to recognize 
NEV as comparable with ICE.  
In 2019, the Tesla Shanghai plant’s commencing production marked the official localization 
of Model 3. At the same time, we also observe that many big names in ICE were also 
accelerating the pace in electrification. For example, BBA (Daimler EQ series, BMW i series, 
and Audi e-tron series) have accelerated its electrification strategies from 2020. We expect 
a number of new models at different class-levels to be roll out by a variety of OEMs, forming 
a complete product line in NEV industry. The market is expecting the B/C class EV market 
will start to compete with ICE from 2020.  
We believe the breakthrough will likely intensify competition between NEV manufacturers 
and ICE OEMs, but this will also create opportunities such as significantly increasing the 
NEV market sales volume as well as ASP boom with increasing high-end vehicle sales.

NEV sales to reach 6.22mn units in 2025E with a CAGR of 43% in 
2020-25E 
Short-term bumpy: EV sales to decline 15% YoY to 1.02mn units in 2020E 
We expect the NEV sales to be 1.02mn units in 2020E, down 15% YoY. In 2019, China's 
NEV production/sales were 1.24mn/1.21mn units, down 2.3%/4.0% YoY, respectively. 
Looking back on 2019, the subsidies for NEV experienced a steep decline with a maximum 
retreat of more than 50%, due to the subsidy transition period exited at the end of Jun 2019. 
As a result, the rising retail price of NEV affected its relative competitiveness compared 
with ICE. Since Jul 2019, NEV sales started a path heading south until the end of 2019. 
Oct and Nov 2019 read dramatic decline of 46% and 44% YoY, respectively.  
At the beginning of 2020, CAAM forecasts that China’s NEV sales will be about 1.20mn 
units in 2020E at similar level as in 2019. However, since the supply side was seriously 
disrupted, the total output in 1H20 has declined by 36.5% YoY. While demand had 
disappeared given the negative income effects affected by COVID-19 in 1Q20, NEV sales 
volume recorded only 393K in 1H20, down 37.4% YoY. As we expect policy support 
measures should underpin the sales performance, we believe NEV will achieve an increase 
of 10% YoY in 2H20E. As a result, we revise down our NEV sales forecast to 1.02mn units 
in 2020E, a decline of 15%YoY.

Medium-term growth to accelerate with a jump in 2021E 
Although the subsidy retreats in 2020 are better than previously expected, three critical 
factors, namely "reducing costs, improving battery life, and ensuring safety" will still be the 
key tasks for the whole NEV industry in the medium-term, which will likely prompt 
technological progress and meet customer demands. As we forecast below, NEV 
production and sales volume derived from “double credit regulation” will jump significantly 
in 2021E, making 2020E a perfect stage to accumulate related shares in NEV sector.

Long-term growth to be enormous with 43% CAGR in 2020-25E  
Even though the cost of NEV will gradually decrease in the next three years, the retail price 
will still be higher than the same grade of ICE without any subsidy. Given full recognition 
of this fact, the government has already extended the subsidy by three years as compared 
with the initial plan in 2020. Beyond financial subsidy, we expect that other trends such as 
(1) double credits; (2) technical support; (3) battery charge subsidy at the operation side 
may provide additional support. 
As we mentioned earlier, we expect the cost parity with ICE will be achieved between 
2023E and 2025E in terms of production cost. According to "Research on the Development 
Trend of Chinese Traditional and New Energy Vehicles 2050" from CATARC, it will take 5 
to 10 years to reach cost parity with ICE in terms of comprehensive cost. Therefore, we 
believe that a surge in sales volume of NEV may happen in the coming 3-5 years as the 
cost gap is shrinking rapidly. The market share of NEV will expand at accelerated speed 
when cost parity nearly achieves.  
We expect the real demand, especially A to C class NEV, will start to release shortly from 
2020. As a result, both ASP for NEV and for components (power battery/IGBT) will rise as 
the proportion of higher-class increases.  
Starting from 2023E, we expect NEV sales volume to grow at an increasing speed with 
improving sales structure. We take the penetration rate of 25% in 2025E set by MIIT as 
given. We expect that the sales volume of NEV in China will be 6.22mn units in 2025E 
with a CAGR of 43% between 2020E and 2025E. Both NEV OEMs and related NEV 
parts/components companies will benefit from the future rapid growth, in our view.

Why do we prefer BYD? 
BYD is one of the first few auto OEMs that invested in the NEV in China. The Company 
has accumulated a great amount of technical knowledge while earning increasing brand 
recognition. BYD has established leading market position in NEV sales. In 2019 in terms 
of sales volume in a global context, BYD was ranked No.2 for total NEV sales; No.3 for 
BEV sales; and No.1 for PHEV sales. We think BYD is well in the position to embrace the 
opportunities that will arise with the enormous growth potential from the NEV market.  
As a conglomerate, BYD is in the leading position in numbers of its business area, such as 
NEV, power battery, IGBT, Cloud rail, Headset electronics, etc. In 2020-21E, we think BYD 
has several eye-catching highlights, sequence by 
1) releasing DM4.0 platform in 4Q20 to defense and enlarge it NEV market shares 
through PHEV; 
2) new launching cycle from 2H20E, especially its flagship model, “Han” to boost NEV 
sales volume;   
3) launching the new blade battery could be a potential game-changer in the power 
battery market;  
4) opening up battery supply to external customers from its “FinDreams” supply chains; 
and  
5) introducing strategic investors, and expressed the intention to sell its IGBT module 
externally 
The business: Auto segment accounts the most for revenue and gross profit 
contribution 
BYD’s main business can be divided into Automobiles and Related Products (internal 
combustion engine and new energy vehicles), Handset Components and Assembly 
Services, Rechargeable Batteries and Photovoltaic, and Other business (urban rail 
transportation). In 2019, the Company achieved sales revenue of RMB127.7bn, of which 
49.5% came from the auto and parts, 41.8% came from the handset components and 
assembly business, 8.2% came from the secondary rechargeable battery business 
(excluding car power batteries), and the remaining 0.5% came from other main businesses 
(include cloud rail). In 2019, GP was RMB20.8bn, of which 66.5% came from the auto and 
parts, 24.0% came from the handset components and assembly business, 9.4% came from 
the secondary rechargeable battery business (excluding car power batteries), and 0.1% 
came from other main businesses (include cloud rail).

Auto - Leading market position in NEV market 
The automotive segment includes two parts, internal combustion engine (ICE) and new 
energy vehicles (NEV). BYD’s ICE sales was generally following a declining trend from 
2014 to 2019 with squeezed market shares due to intensified market competition. In 
reverse to ICE, NEV sales was following an increasing trend, experienced rapid growth 
from 2015 to 2018. NEV will be our key focus in the automotive segment.  
The Company has sold a total of 461.4K vehicles in 2019, a decrease of 11.4%YoY, due 
to the overall market slowdown. Among the total sales, 231.9K of which are ICE, down 
15.0%YoY whereas 229.5K of which are NEV, down 7.4%YoY. In the field of ICE, SUV 
accounts for 52%; MPV accounts for 27%; and sedan accounts for 21% in terms of sales 
volume. In 2019, auto business achieved revenues of RMB63.3bn, a drop of 16.8%YoY.

NEV Highlight 1 – Comprehensive NEV types and technical routes 
BYD is one of the first few auto OEMs that invested in the NEV in China. Given first-
mover advantage, the Company has accumulated a great amount of technical knowledge 
while earning strong brand recognition. The Company has a high-level strategic agenda, 
namely "7+4", covering seven types of vehicles such as PV, city bus, taxis, logistics, etc. 
and in four special application scenarios such as warehousing, ports, airports, and mines. 
In 2019, BYD was ranked No.2 globally in terms of NEV sales volume. Among them, its 
BEV was ranked No.3 while PHEV ranked No.1 globally.  
In 2019, PV accounted for 96% of its NEV sales while CV accounted for 4%. Its market 
share in China has perfectly reflected BYD’s first-mover advantage and great product 
recognition. In 2019, BYD ranks No.1 in the NEPV market with a market share of 21%. In 
addition, BYD ranks No.4 in the NEV bus market with a market share of 8%.

In the NEPV field, BYD has two series models, namely Dynasty (Qin, Tang, Song, Yuan, 
etc) and e series (e1, e2, S2). Dynasty models are priced ranging from RMB70K to 
RMB260K. In 2019, BYD launched its e series, including e1/e2/e3/S2, which will focus on 
mass-market with a price range at RMB60K to RMB140K. In Jul 2020, BYD launched a 
brand new model, Han, with a price range from RMB220K to RMB280K. The new models

have enriched the product matrix and filled-in the product gap in the lower-/higher-
end, which is expected to bring new growth.  
In the NECV field, the main products include EV bus, EV coach, EV trucks and special CV, 
etc. BYD has chosen BEV strategy in its CV market. Up to now, BYD has successfully sold 
its EV bus in six continents and more than 50 countries, reflecting its global presence and 
brand recognition.

NEV Highlight 3 – High R&D Investment 
BYD has been consistently invested in cutting-edge technology. In 2019, the 
Company has R&D expenses of RMB4,141mn, representing 3.24% R&D expense to 
revenue ratio, which was the highest since 2014. The annual patents of BYD increased 
24,875 in 2019 from 130 in 2004, as a result of heavy R&D investments. BYD also 
accumulated various technology advantage such as vehicle manufacturing, power battery, 
and IGBT chip, etc.

 
NEV Highlight 4 - DM4.0 Technology 
We believe PHEV will outperform BEV in the overall NEV market in medium-term 
given 1) policy shift; 2) cost advantage and 3) persistent mile range anxiety. Wan 
Gang, Minister of Science and Technology, said that "the development of a high-efficiency 
electromechanical hybrid system is the direction of our NEV". Recent updates on the 
“Double credit” policy also tilts more to PHEV. It is commonly believed that PHEV will reach 
cost parity sooner than that of BEV by the market. We also expect the mile range anxiety 
will last in the future for a considerable period. We think consumers would prefer PHEV in 
which BYD has a comparative advantage. Among the global NEV sales in 2019, 
BEV/PHEV/FCV accounted for 74.6%/25.0%/0.4% respectively. We expect PHEV to 
enlarge its overall shares in the medium-term.

In addition to overall PHEV market growth, BYD also has cutting-edge dual-mode 
technology to support PHEV products. BYD expects to launch its 4th-generation PHEV 
technology, Dual-Mode 4.0(DM4.0), in 4Q20E. DM4.0 consists of DM-p and DM-i platforms. 
DM-p will shape its focus on power output. Han DM will be the first model equipped with a 
DM-p platform. DM-i platform mainly focuses on the cost economy. We believe DM-i will 
likely to help achieve the cost parity with ICE. If BYD can successfully achieve this goal, it 
will help the Company 1) reiterate its brand recognition; 2) expand its market share by 
utilizing the cost advantage. We expect BYD PHEV will have a strong performance and will 
regain market share in 2021E prompted by new car models equipped with DM4.0 to launch. 
 
NEV Highlight 5 – To B business 
BYD takes advantage of its first-mover advantage and has a strong economic moat 
in the fields of EV taxi, EV ride-hailing vehicle, and EV city bus. For example, in 2019, 
about 60K units of EV were sold to operating entities, accounting for 27% of its NEPV sales 
volume. It commonly believes that the replacement cycle for a taxi is six years. If we mark 
2015 as the beginning of the electrification among China's operating vehicles, we expect 
that China's EV taxis/ride-hailing vehicle will start the first renewal cycle with an annual 
23 Jul 2020 
 
 
 
 
PLEASE READ THE ANALYST CERTIFICATION AND IMPORTANT DISCLOSURES ON LAST PAGE 
18 
proportion of 10-15% in the short-/medium- term. BYD, as the first batch of companies that 
provide EV operating vehicles, will maintain a competitive advantage in the B field. 
 
NEV Highlight 6 – new launching cycle in 2H20E–2021E 
Launching blade batteries and Han models will be marked as the origin of the new 
product cycle, in our view. Han, a flagship B+ class vehicle, has accumulated over 20K 
bookings as of now. We believe the monthly sales of Han will reach 3K to 4K with a potential 
surprise. As previously mentioned, all DM models will equip with DM4.0 in later 2020E. A 
new product cycle will revert its less-than-demanding performance in 1H20. 
 
Sales forecast 
BYD’s NEV market share declined slightly from 19.7% in 2018 to 19.0% in 2019, due to 
subsidy withdrawal which brought negative impacts to NEV sales. However, given the six 
advantages discussed above, we expect BYD to start regain market share in the NEV 
sector as the NEV market normalizing back to its trajectory. We expect its market 
share in the NEV market will bounce back from 18.2% in 2020E to 18.8%/19.1% in 
2021E/22E. In terms of ICE, we expect BYD also to slightly lose shares as market 
competition intensifies.

 
Financial forecast 
Affected by multiple factors such as the emission standard switch/subsidy retreat, NEV 
sales in China were only 1.21mn units in 2019, down 4.0% YoY. BYD's NEV sales volume 
was 230K in 2019, representing a decrease of 7.4%YoY. Affected by COVID-19, we think 
the sales of NEV in China in 2020E will face great pressure as in 2019. However, we have 
already observed that the central government had extended the subsidy schedule until 
2022E from its original subsidy exit plan of 2020E. In addition, a variety of regions have 
also introduced a local subsidy to boost NEV purchase in 2020E. Therefore, we expect the 
sales volume of NEV in China will be to 1.02mn units, a strong rebound from 1H20, but still 
indicating a decrease of 15%YoY. 
We believe that BYD's launch of new batteries (Blade battery) and new models(Han) 
will support its overall sales. BYD will also release its DM4.0 version PHEV across its all 
major models in 4Q20E. At the same time, Guangdong and Shenzhen have introduced 
NEV subsidy policies that will likely to support BYD's NEV sales. Even though BYD’s NEV 
sales underperformed the market in 1H20, we remain confident in its performance in 2H20 
and going forward. We expect BYD’s new car model launching cycle with cutting the edge 
technologies will help the Company further improve its brand recognition, which will support 
NEV sales. In 2020E, we forecast NEV will have a sales volume decline of 19% YoY (NEPV 
-19%/NECV -10%) with NEV sales volume of 186.3K units. We forecast ASP for NEV will 
rise by 7% in 2020E as vehicle type/product mix changes. In 2021-22E, we expect NEV 
sales volume to pick up rapidly to 319.9K/514.4K unites, respectively, while ASP to 
maintain upward trends as NEV sales shift to high end models.

For ICE, we expect the rollout of Song Plus will underpin the ICE performance. 
Specifically, we expect the sales volume of its ICE will be 209K in 2020E, a decline of 
10%YoY. We expect the ASP for ICE will increase slightly to RMB105K in 2020E, an 
increase of 5.0%YoY as the proportion of higher-class product increases.

NEV parts business 
BYD was one of the auto OEMs that invested heavily in the NEV field and has 
increasingly shifted its focus to NEV business. With the continuous investment in R&D, 
the Company has accumulated technical advantage in the core technology of NEV supply 
chains such as power battery and IGBT. Beside, BYD also has technological accumulation 
in both EV and Hybrid technical routes. We believe the subsidy retreat happening now will 
lead to NEV sector consolidation and will radically change the over-supply condition. We 
believe BYD not only has adequate demand to survive this winter but also has the 
capability/capacity to become a major supplier for other NEV OEMs when this consolidation 
phase passes. 
 
Reorganizing the internal supply chain 
The Company initially adopted a vertical integration model in its NEV supply chain 
which internalized all production nodes in auto production (model design, mold 
development, key parts design and manufacturing, assembly, quality control, sales 
channel management, etc.). The vertical management model enables the Company to 
accomplish technology accumulation in all production aspects. However, it also induces 
higher management costs/production cost.  
From 2017, BYD gradually opened up its supply chain. From the perspective of the supply 
side, purchasing parts/components from the outside vendor can improve the quality of parts, 
reduce procurement costs and management costs. From the perspective of the demand 
side, the Company can monetize its advantages in parts/components (power batteries, 
IGBT, etc) to foster new income sources and improve the performance of the automotive 
sector.

“FinDreams” 
On 16 Mar 2020, BYD announced the establishment of five subsidiary companies 
collectively known as “FinDreams (FinDreams Battery, FinDreams Vision, 
FinDreams Technology, FinDreams Power and FinDreams Mould)”. The FinDreams 
covers different businesses ranging from power batteries, semiconductors, chassis, and 
other fields. It marked that BYD's supply chain reform has moved into a new stage. It is 
also a big step forward for BYD to underpin its e-platform strategy.

We think BYD’s value will be highly dependent on its opening supply chain strategy for its 
NEV parts business. We will focus on two of the key parts, namely the power battery 
business and the semiconductor business, in our following discussion in this report.  We 
think the future performance of “FinDreams” will be a critical factor for BYD and its valuation.

1. Power battery 
BYD’s power battery was previously used for internal supply only. However, BYD 
expressed the intention for external sales given that 1) power battery market has giant 
demand high growth potential insight, and 2) the Company had accumulated technology 
advantages in battery cost leadership and safety performance. According to BYD, several 
OEMs had entered discussions with the Company. After the initial trial phases, we expect 
BYD power battery to have external shipments from 2021, and to reach high shipment 
growth in 2022E. We estimate the external shipment of BYD batteries to be 
0.1/2.6/18.7GWh in 2020E/21E/22E respectively. The corresponding revenue will reach 
RMB0.1/2.0/13.7bn in 20E/21E/22E. In 2025E, we forecast BYD will sell 72.0GWh 
externally with a corresponding revenue of RMB46.1bn. 
 
Overview in the power battery industry 
The power battery value chain can be divided into three sectors: raw materials in upstream, 
production in midstream, and application in downstream. The power battery system can be 
simply divided into hardware and software (BMS). The hardware includes a variety of levels 
in the production-side, namely cell, module, and the final battery pack. The cell can also be 
further divided into positive and negative electrodes, electrolytes, and separators. These 
are derived from the raw materials, which are upstream of the whole value chain.  
The upstream of power batteries is mainly dominated by mineral resources such as cobalt, 
manganese, nickel, and lithium. Cobalt, manganese, nickel, lithium, and other raw 
materials are used as positive electrode materials. Lithium ore is also used for both 
negative electrode and electrolyte. Graphite is mainly used for the negative electrode. The 
midstream includes the manufacture of the positive electrode, negative electrode, 
electrolyte, and separator. The downstream of power batteries are mainly OEMs and 
energy storage sectors.

Power battery type 
Power batteries can be mainly classified into two categories, LFP(LiFePO4) batteries 
and ternary lithium batteries (including nickel cobalt manganese (NCM), nickel 
cobalt aluminum (NCA)). Other types such as lithium manganese battery, lithium titanate 
battery, super capacitor, have a relatively small proportion. One form of power battery, 
namely solid-state battery, may potentially destruct the current landscape. However, we 
believe that the technology of solid-state batteries was immature. It is expected to achieve 
full commercialization around 2030E. Therefore, we still focus on LFP and ternary lithium 
batteries here. 
In general, LFP has the characteristics of good safety and low cost while the ternary 
battery has a longer mile range given higher energy density. Due to the difference in 
application scenarios, about 93% of BEV buses were equipped with LFP while about 74% 
of BEV PV were installed with ternary lithium batteries.

According to GGII, in 2019, the total NEV that installed with power battery in China 
was 1.18mn units, a decrease of 4%YoY. Among them, 916K of which were installed 
with ternary batteries, accounting for 78% of total NEV; LFP was installed on 169K vehicles, 
accounting for 14% of total NEV.

According to GGII, in 2019, the total installed capacity power battery was 62.3GWh 
an increase of 9%YoY. Among them, the installed capacity of ternary batteries was 
38.4GWh, accounting for 61% of the total installed; the installed capacity of LFP was 
20.0GWh, accounting for 32% of the total installed.

In the early stage of NEV development, the Chinese government adopted a whitelist 
for power battery to foster the local industry. OEMs could receive financial subsidy only 
if its power battery suppliers were admitted into the official power battery whitelist. A total 
of 57 battery companies have been admitted to the list including CATL, Guoxuan Hi-Tech, 
Lision, Optimum whereas foreign brands such as Samsung SDI, LG, Panasonic were all 
excluded from the list. In Jun 2019, MIIT officially abolished whitelist marking the inception 
of the new competition stage. The domestic power battery player will, therefore, face fiercer 
competition from overseas giants such as LG and Samsung SDI.

At the end of 2019, we can simply divide the power battery manufacturing 
enterprises into three echelons. The first echelon includes CATL, Panasonic, BYD, LG, 
Samsung SDI. The second consists of Farasis, Evebattery, Lision, Guoxuan Hi-tech, etc. 
The third echelon comprises other small manufacturing enterprises. We calculated that 
CR3 in the power battery industry reached 57%; CR5 reached 68%; CR10 reached 81% 
in 2019. Since 2015, the number of power battery companies has gradually decreased 
which reflecting the intensification of market competition. We expect that under the 
pressure of cost reduction, top tiers will continue to gain market shares which makes the 
industry further integrated. 
 
Technical roadmap 
We believe the economies of scale will outweigh the technology process in the 
process of cost reduction. There is a dispute about the technical route in the field of 
power batteries.

high nickel, which mainly solves the problem of mile range. At the same time, due to the 
scarcity and monopoly of cobalt resources, high nickel also minimizes the supply chain risk. 
The 811 monomer energy density can reach 280Wh/kg. According to SMM, NCM811 
ternary precursor is still 29% more expensive than NCM523 ternary precursor.

BYD will change the game - Blade battery 
However, BYD chose to focus on LFP battery development. BYD has consistently 
optimized the physical structure of the LFP battery in order to improve its mile range by 
increasing the system energy density.  
In 2019, BYD has deployed NCM on all PVs while used LFP on all CVs. The situation has 
changed recently as BYD released its blade battery on 29 Mar 2020. As one of LFP 
batteries, the most important achievement of blade battery is that it improves the overall 
energy density of the battery pack through process improvements, thereby overcoming the 
disadvantage of short-range of LFP compared to NCM. In the meanwhile, it kept the 
advantage of high safety and long lifespan of traditional LFP. In the nail penetration test, 
the ternary battery can only achieve safety at the pack level, while the blade battery can 
elevate it to the cell level. At the same time, the blade battery can make the new car NEDC 
last more than 600 kilometers. It will be first used in Han EV in 3Q20E and then 
subsequently equipped on Qin Pro, Qin EV, Song Plus, etc. in 4Q20E.

In terms of cost, the blade battery was 20-30% lower than the main-stream NCM811 
at the pack level. In addition, luxury brands may focus more on safety as reputation risk 
were greater than new entries. Such a significant cost advantage will provide great 
competitive advantage overall in NCM. We believe power mass density/volume density will 
increase further as BYD is in the process of R&D in the second generation of blade battery.

We believe the release of its blade battery will totally change the competitive 
landscape. While maintaining its safety nature of LFP, it has increased the mile range. As 
a result, the blade battery broadens the application scenarios of LFP battery, enabling it to 
be assembled in A to C-class NEVs. In the meanwhile, due to the nature of the ternary 
lithium battery, the risk of thermal runaway when facing the acupuncture experiment is 
higher than that of the LFP battery. We expect that BYD will focus on "safety" in the 
marketing of blade battery so as to gain more market share in this sub-segment. Given 
diverse demand from customers, blade battery will definitely fit in certain safety demands 
and will gain more market shares. In other words, ternary lithium batteries will face 
competition from its opponent.

Total power battery market size in China 
According to the GGII, the total installed capacity of power batteries in China was 62.8GWh 
in 2019. CATL was the dominant player in the power battery industry with a market share 
of 51.8%. BYD was the 2nd largest player with a market share of 17.3%. 
According to the CMBIS estimate, we forecast that the total installed capacity of power 
batteries in China will be 55.6Gwh in 2020E, a decline of 10.8%YoY due to COVID-19 
impacts. However, given CMBIS forecast on China’s NEV industry through 2025E, we 
are confident that power battery installation will rebound back to its high growth 
path in 2021E as NEV sales normalize to its high growth trajectory.

BYD has accumulated the technical advantage and production capacity as it 
originated from the battery business. According to GGII, in 2019, the Company's 
installed capacity was 197.6K units, with a market share of 16.8%; the installed power is 
10.78GWh, with a market share of 17.3%.

We expect BYD to have a total production capacity of 50GWh in 2020E, which is fully 
capable of internal production. Among all production capacity, NCM/LFP/Blade accounts 
for 30/10/10GW respectively. As of now, BYD has a total production capacity of a blade 
battery of 10GWh, equivalent to about 180K units of the vehicle. In 2020E, we expect the 
blade battery will prioritize internal supply as production was still in the ramp-up period. If 
we take unit installed capacity of 54Wh, we expect a total production capacity of 0.93mn 
units NEV in 2020E. BYD ranks No.2 in Chinese power battery supplier in terms of total 
installed capacity with a leading position in battery density and safety aspects. Based on 
our calculation, BYD has idle capacity for external sales. According to the Company’s 
guidance, we expect the blade battery will be sold to external clients in late 2021E/early 
2022E.

Financial forecast 
Given current production capacity, we believe its power batteries in 2020E will be mostly 
installed internally. With the substantial increase in China’s NEV sales and capacity release, 
we expect that the external shipment of power batteries will skyrocket from 2021E/22E. We 
forecast the external shipment of BYD batteries to be 0.1/2.6/18.7GWh in 2020E/21E/22E 
respectively. The corresponding revenue will reach RMB 0.1/2.0/13.7bn in 20E/21E/22E. 
In addition, the Company has widely exploited in the supply chain upstream of power 
batteries, including Lithium mine, the positive electrode, separator, electrolyte, etc., which 
effectively guarantees the cost and the stability of its supply chain. BYD has widely 
deployed in the upstream supply chain of power batteries, including salt lake lithium mine,

the positive electrode, separator, electrolyte, etc. By doing so, BYD is able to enforce cost 
control measures while maintaining its supply chain stability. We believe the economies of 
scale will realize, as the power battery will gradually sell to external customers, which will 
ultimately reduce the unit cost. 
We expect its power battery segment will get an independent listing on Starboard in 
2022E, significantly lifting its segment valuation.

2. IGBT module 
BYD’s IGBT is used for internal supply only as well. BYD semiconductor introduced 
strategic investors and expressed the intention to sell its IGBT module externally. 
 
 Overview in IGBT industry 
IGBT (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor 绝缘栅双极型晶体管) is a composite fully 
controlled voltage-driven power semiconductor device composed of BJT (bipolar 
transistor) and MOSFET (insulated gate field effect transistor), which combines the 
advantage of both BJT and MOSFET. IGBT is known as the "CPU" of power electronic 
devices. 
The power battery is generally stored as direct current and needs to be converted to 
alternating current in order to drive the motor of EV (mainly classified as Permanent-magnet 
synchronous motor 永磁同步电机 and AC asynchronous motor 交流异步电机).

IGBT directly controls the conversion of Direct Current/Alternating Current of the 
drive system and also determines the maximum torque/maximum output power. In 
addition to driving systems, IGBT was used on high-voltage chargers, air-conditioning 
systems, and other electrical components of NEV. 
IGBT chip is one of the critical components for EV engines. Due to design complexity, 
sophisticated manufacture requirement, and a large investment, the IGBT sector has a high 
entry barrier. For EV, the IGBT module accounts for about 50% of the cost of the motor 
drive system/5%-10% of the total cost of the vehicle. Therefore, it is the 2nd-largest cost 
component other than the power battery. It also determines the energy efficiency of the 
vehicle. At present, about 90% of the IGBTs used in China depend on imports, most of 
which are provided by Infineon, Mitsubishi, Fuji, ON Semiconductor, ABB.

BYD’s technology advantage and cost advantage 
In 2005, BYD formed its own R&D team and started to invest in the IGBT industry. As 
of now, BYD is a top auto OEM in China that has the capability of producing IGBT modules, 
including IGBT chip design and manufacturing, IGBT module design and manufacturing, 
QA platform, and NEV application.  
In Dec 2018, BYD launched its IGBT 4.0. Its comprehensive loss is 20% lower than the 
mainstream product while the temperature-cycle life is increased by more than 10 times. In 
terms of cost, BYD has around one-third of cost advantage over a similar product. The 
downstream application scenario covers A0 to B+ class vehicles while other main players 
such as StarPower can only apply to A0 class vehicles. At the end of 2018, the yearly 
production capacity of IGBT units was 600K. As of now, BYD has achieved a production 
capacity of 1.2mn units per year. 
On 14 Apr 2020, BYD announced that it had completed the internal transfer of its 
wholly-owned subsidiary Shenzhen BYD Microelectronics Co., Ltd. through the 
equity transfer and business transfer between its subsidiaries. Reorganized and 
officially renamed BYD Semiconductor Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as "BYD 
Semiconductor"). BYD stated that it intends to introduce strategic investors by means of 
the capital increase and share expansion, and actively seeks independent listing at an 
appropriate time. However, after the completion of the introduction of strategic investors, 
BYD Semiconductor will remain a subsidiary of BYD. At the same time, BYD is actively 
deploying the next generation of semiconductor material SiC. The Company has 
announced the successful development of SiC Mosfet, which is expected to improve the 
performance of the entire vehicle by 10%. 
 
IGBT Market size forecast 
According to "Intelligence Research Group", the global IGBT market size in 2018 was 
USD5bn, an increase of 11.06%YoY. Of which, China was the world's single largest market 
and has reached USD2.1bn market size, accounting for about 40% of the global IGBT 
market. 
According to GGII, China’s IGBT market will have a market size of RMB20bn in 2020E 
driven by strong demand for NEV and charging piles. According to "Intelligence Research

Group", China's IGBT industry output will reach 78.2mn units while the demand will reach 
196mn units by 2024E. 
We estimate the total IGBT (NEV level) market size will reach RMB2.8bn in 2020E and 
RMB18.3bn in 2025E. In 2019, the Company installed about 194K sets of NEV IGBTs 
domestically, with a market share of 18% and a rank of 2nd place.

 
Financial forecast 
Given its cost advantage, we believe BYD will materialize the import substitution in 
the IGBT module industry. We expect that the external sales of the IGBT module will start 
from 2021E/22E. We forecast the external shipment of IGBT to be 133K/274K in 
2021E/22E respectively. The overall ASP will increase gradually as the proportion of higher 
class increases. We forecast the corresponding revenue will reach RMB370/778mn in 
2020E/21E. 
We expect a surge in IGBT demand from NEV as NEV cost parity may materialize in 
2023E. Therefore, we believe BYD will expand its IGBT production capacity in order to 
meet downstream demand. In 2025E, BYD will sell 995K units of IGBT module externally 
with revenue of RMB2.9bn. 
We expect its power battery segment will get an independent listing on Starboard in 
2021E, significantly lifting its segment valuation.

3. Consumer electronics (Component + Assembly Service) 
BYD operates its consumer electronics segment through its subsidiary BYD 
Electronics (285 HK). As one of the world's most comprehensive cell phone components 
and assembly service providers, BYD provides a one-stop business model, including 
design, component, and assembly services for domestic and foreign mobile phone 
manufacturers. Its main customers include Apple, Samsung, Microsoft, Dell, Toshiba, 
Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, Lenovo, and ZTE. 
In recent years, BYD electronics has grown steadily in terms of revenue. In 2019, 
BYD Electronics achieved revenues of RMB53.4bn, an increase of 26.4%YoY. However, 
due to the slowdown in the smartphone market and the fierce competition, its bottom-line 
drop to RMB1.65bn, a decline of 28.0% YoY.  
BYD Electronics (285 HK) is covered by the CMBIS TMT team (Alex Ng).

 
Financial forecast 
Due to different accounting in Mainland, China, and HKSAR, China, the revenue reported 
by BYDE (285 HK) and the segment revenue in BYD (1211 HK) have a slight discrepancy. 
Therefore, we take the growth rate forecast from the CMBIS TMT team as our key 
assumption to keep the CMBI consistency. As a result, we believe the top-line for 
handset components and assembly services will grow at 37.8%/12.8%/22.9% to 
RMB74/83/102bn in 2020E/21E/22E.

4. Secondary rechargeable batteries and photovoltaics 
In the field of secondary rechargeable batteries, BYD carries layout covering the 
entire supply chain, from the mineral resources to the final battery packs. It has 
technical accumulations from battery design to module packing.  
BYD’s current products include nickel-metal hydride batteries, lithium cobalt oxide batteries, 
lithium iron phosphate batteries, ternary batteries, which are widely used in electronic 
products, NEV, Energy storage, and other fields. 
Through its rechargeable product, BYD also expands its business to the downstream 
industry. It has also launched a variety of renewable energy solutions such as solar power 
stations, energy storage power stations, electric forklifts, etc., providing a complete set of 
renewable energy solutions from power generation to energy storage/consumption. 
In 2019, the secondary rechargeable batteries and photovoltaics achieved revenue of 
RMB10.5bn, an increase of 17.4%YoY. In 2020E, we expect this segment to maintain its 
steady growth path.

 
Financial forecast 
According to CNESA, at the worst-case scenario, electrochemical energy storage will have 
a total install capacity of 2,727MW in 2020E, an increase of 59.7%YoY; at the best-case 
scenario, electrochemical energy storage will have a total install capacity of 3,092MW in 
2020E, an increase of 80.9%YoY. Given the continued decline in battery prices and 
demand from 5G base station construction, we are definitely optimistic about future 
development of energy storage. For BYD, we expect the revenue from rechargeable 
batteries and photovoltaic will be RMB13/14/16bn, an increase of 20%/15%/12% YoY 
in 2020E.

In Oct 2016, BYD released its first cloud rail prototype. Compared with traditional 
subway/underground, cloud rail has advantages such as flexible route layout, low 
construction cost, etc. At the end of 2019, many domestic cities include Yinchuan, Jining, 
Bengbu, have expressed interest in Cloud rail while many foreign cities such as 
Salvador(Brazil) also signed a construction contract with BYD. In 2019, other business 
achieved revenues of RMB587mn, a decline of 79.5%YoY. 
In 2020E, we believe the cloud rail business may surprise the market as two projects 
(Shenzhen and Chongqing) was in great progress. We expect the market will have a 
potential re-rating on its cloud rail segment as income gradually realizes.

Financial forecast 
We only take cloud rail/bus as other businesses here. Given a more friendly policy 
environment, we believe the cloud rail business may outperform its historical path. In 
addition, we believe the fiscal policy will play a critical role in counter-cyclical adjustment 
due to the negative impact of COVID-19 in 2020E. Therefore, we believe the local 
government may expand its investment in urban transportation. Given the positive progress 
in Shenzhen and Chongqing projects and the company’s guidance, we forecast that

revenue from the cloud rail business will be RMB5.9/7.3/8.8bn in 2020E/21E/22E, a 
900.0%/25%/20%YoY increase.

Financial Analysis 
 
Revenue 
The Company generates revenue through Automobiles and Related Products, Handset 
Components and Assembly Services, Rechargeable Batteries and Photovoltaic, and Other 
business. In 2019, revenue from auto and related products decreased by 16.8% YoY to 
RMB 63.3bn, whereas revenue from handset components and assembly services 
increased 26.4%YoY to RMB53.4bn. In 2019, revenue from rechargeable batteries and 
photovoltaic increased 17.4% YoY to RMB10.5bn, whereas revenue from other businesses 
decreased by 79.5% YoY to RMB587mn. 
By summing up above each segment, we estimate the revenue for BYD will be 
RMB149bn/190bn/267bn, an increase of 17%/28%/40% in 2020E/21E/22E.

 
Gross profit/Net profit(overall) 
We believe four factors may put auto segment GPM into pressure in 1H20E given 1) BYD 
has rolled e series which focus on the mass market; 2) great competition in overall NEV 
market; 3) subsidy retreat; 4) COVID-19 impact. However, we still believe the GPM for NEV 
in 2020E will exceed that of 2019E given 1) marginal YoY improvement in NEV industry 
and 2) local subsidy support (i.e. Shenzhen). Therefore, we believe GPM from the auto 
segment will slightly rise by 0.7ppt to 22.6% in 2020E. We take the GPM forecast for 
Handset Components and Assembly Services from CMBI TMT. Specifically, we believe 
GPM for this segment will be 10.1% in 2020E. We believe rechargeable batteries and 
photovoltaic will keep its growth momentum with a GPM of 19.0% in 2020E. We believe 
the GPM from the cloud rail business will rebound to 4.0% in 2020E. In aggregate, we 
estimate the GPM for BYD will achieve 15.4% in 2020E. 
Even though GPM for auto segment/HCAS will face downward pressure, we believe GPM 
will keep at 15.2%/15.7% in 2021E/22E as power battery/IGBT has a higher margin 
compared with other segments.

Valuation 
Initiate BUY with TP RMB112.12(26.0% upside)  
We adopt the SOTP method to evaluate BYD’s value. We derive BYD’s overall value of 
RMB359.9bn in 2021E, mainly comprised of 37% of Auto and related product sales and 
45% of the newly emerging Power Battery business. We apply a 15% conglomerate 
discount to reflect the complexity of BYD’s business segments. Our TP for BYD-A is 
RMB112.12 per share, implying a 26.0% upside. We initiate BYD-A with BUY 
recommendation.  
For short-term to medium term, we think BYD’s valuation will be sensitive to 1) monthly 
sales figure release of new car model; 2) power battery and IGBT’s progress on the external 
shipment in 2021-22E; and 3) progress of potential spin-off of power battery and IGBT 
business in the A-share market.  
Valuation is experiencing re-rating 
Looking back at BYD-A’s share price history in the past five years, a forward PER valuation 
was ranged between 26.6x and 87.9x with an average of 52.3x; forward PBR valuation was 
ranged between 1.9x and 4.5x with an average of 2.9x. 
BYD’s valuation exhibited quite significant policy sensitivity. We observed obvious re-rating 
from Jul 2017, as BYD-A was traded up 1 level, from -1 STD to +1 STD, driven by 1) 
Chinese government’s establishment of long-term NEV promotion mechanism through 
releasing policy draft of the double credit system; and 2) BYD was launching new flagship 
MPV car called Song Max. We think the market’s recognition of NEV’s long-term high 
growth potential and BYD’s new EV model’s competitiveness had triggered the re-rating. 
From Jun 2020, we think BYD is experiencing another re-rating process, on the back of 1) 
Chinese government’s revised double credit policy and target enforcement of the policy 
from 2021; 2) NEV purchase subsidy to sustain with a step-down scheme until end-2022; 
3) BYD launching new Han series car model and blade battery; and more importantly 4) 
opening up supply chain strategy release value of power battery and IGBT business. 
Although share price has experienced a significant rebound of 92% from a year low at year 
begin, we believe the re-rating process is not yet finished, and we think our rigorous 
valuation model supports our view.

Our valuation for BYD points at RMB305.9bn 
We adopt the SOTP method to evaluate BYD’s value, given the Company’s diverse 
business segments. We also divide BYD’s business segments into two groups, namely 
 
the tangible group generating revenue and earnings from external customers with 
the mature business model including 1) Auto, b) Handset Components and Assembly 
services, and 3) Rechargeable Batteries and Photovoltaic; and  
 
the intangible group containing auto supply chain open up a business including 1) 
Power Battery, 2) IGBT, and BYD’s emerging 3) Cloud Rail business.  
We estimate the tangible group worth RMB170bn or RMB62.30 per share in FY21E, 
comprised of RMB133bn from ICE and NEV auto sales, RMB12.3bn from rechargeable 
batteries and photovoltaic business, and RMB24.7bn for HCAS business based on BYD’s 
holdings on BYD Electronics (BYDE, 285 HK). Our tangible segment valuations are based 
on market P/S comparable, and our in-house TMT team’s valuation on BYDE (link).  
We believe BYD’s market value will be highly dependent on the intangible and emerging 
business, especially from the power battery segment. We estimate the overall intangible 
group worth RMB189.9bn or RMB69.6 per share in 2021E, leading by the power battery 
segment with a valuation of RMB162.8bn or RMB59.69 per share. We has listed our 
valuation details for power batter, IGBT, and cloud rail in our following discussions.

Power Battery 
Since BYD just opened up its power battery supply chain to external customers, there is 
no clear earnings data to support the valuation. We project BYD power battery’s long term 
growth path based on the assumptions that the Company will gain NEV installation market 
shares in China, and we expect the segment to have relatively stable net profit margin rate 
at 15% with reference to CATL (300750 CH), a pure-play market leader of the power battery 
business. In 2025E, we estimate the BYD power battery to seize 34.0% market share in 
China, shipping 72GWh to external customers, realizing revenue and net profit of 
RMB46bn/RMB7.5bn respectively.  
We expect high shipment growth to continue, as our model implying only 9.0% of global 
NEV penetration rate measure by vehicle sales in 2025. We apply 30x PER (based on 1X 
PEG) on 2025E earnings and discount back to 2021 based on 8.5% WACC to derive a 
2021E power battery valuation of RMB162.8bn. With reference to CATL’s market value of 
RMB457bn and consensus estimates of 94x FY20E PER with earnings CAGR of 22.6% in 
2019-22E, we think our valuation for BYD power battery is justified. BYD plans to take the 
power battery business public by 2022E, by then we think the segment’s value can be fully 
released.

IGBT 
Same as a power battery, BYD’s IGBT business provides no clear figure to support the 
valuation. We also project IGBT’s expansion and external shipment path till 2025E, based 
on several key assumptions including capacity addition, utilization rate, increasing ASP 
trend as NEV sales shift towards high-end models as well as net profit margin. Our net 
profit margin is set based on StarPower (603290 CH), a pure-play IGBT module 
manufacturer just entering the NEV IGBT market. In 2025E, we estimate BYD IGBT to 
seize 33.3% market share in China, shipping 1.07mn sets to domestic car installation, 
realizing revenue and net profit of RMB2.93bn/RMB880mn respectively. 
We apply 35x PER (based on 1X PEG) on 2025E earnings and discount back to 2021 
based on 8.5% WACC to derive the 2021E IGBT valuation of RMB22.2bn. Taking 72.3% 
of the total equity ratio, we estimate that value attributable to BYD will be RMB16.0bn.  
StarPower is currently has a market value of RMB38.8bn, trading at FY20E 214x PER with 
27.4% earnings CAGR in 2019-22E. Comparing with StarPower, we believe BYD has two 
advantages 1) cover all types of vehicle from A0 to B+ class (StarPower can only apply to 
A0); 2) great tracking record and larger market share in vehicle level IGBT; 3) high growth 
potential as BYD will expand production capacity; 4) great reputation while StarPower has 
fraudulent tracking record. As for a reference, BYD issued an announcement on 15 Jun 
2020, that BYD Semiconductor has already accomplished A+ round of financing and 
introduced a total of 30 strategic investors. After the A+ round of financing, the valuation of 
BYD Semiconductor has reached RMB10.2bn. The Company plans to take its IGBT 
business public listed in 2H21E. We think our valuation for BYD’s IGBT business is justified, 
and the potential IPO will further unlock the segment’s value.

Cloud rail 
In Jun 2018, the State Council issued the "Opinions on Further Strengthening the 
Management of Urban Rail Transit Planning and Construction" 《关于进一步加强城市轨道
交通规划建设管理的意见》(国办发〔2018〕52 号)(52 号文), tightening the application 
criteria for the construction of urban rail projects. However, we observe recent policy 
updates indicating policy loss in this field. Since 2020, the Chinese government has begun 
to emphasize new infrastructure. Infrastructure projects in such fields as 5G networks, 
extra-high-voltage power transmission projects, inter-city transit, vehicle charging stations, 
big data centers, industrial networks, and projects exhibiting Internet of Things 
characteristics are all considered to be examples of new infrastructure. Urban rail is the 
only sub-field included in both new infrastructure and traditional infrastructure. 
Given the policy spur and project progress, we forecast that the revenue from Cloud Rail 
in 2021E will reach RMB7.3bn. We expect the cloud rail will get out of the dull pattern in 
the past and head to a high growth period in the next few years. We take CRRC (601766 
CH, NR) as our valuation reference. The forward average PS ratio of CRRC was 1.35x 
while we take 1.50x PS for BYD to reflect the high potential growth potential backed by 
contacts signed. We derive the Cloud Rail segment’s valuation of RMB11.0bn in 2021E.  
Other potentials values 
Though we have considered major explicit and implicit valuation, we believe BYD still has 
other potential values that can be unlocked in the future.  
1) Conservative market assumption. We only consider NEV sales, power battery, IGBT 
module under the backdrop of China domestic market for now. If BYD starts to expand its 
business aboard, we think the valuation will have the potential to rise further.

2) Other hidden business segments. In addition to explicit and implicit valuation 
mentioned in our previous discussion, we believe BYD still has additional values that can 
be potentially realized in the future such as the NEV motor segment, platform technology, 
etc.

Risk factors 
Fiercer market competition 
At present, the competitive landscape of the NEV is still undergoing dynamic changes. New 
Comers (NIO, Weltmeister, Xpeng, etc) and foreign brands (Tesla, BBA, etc) are gradually 
entering into the market. In the future, market competition will definitely intensify. To 
continue to gain market share, BYD not only has to have the technical advantage as 
previously mentioned but also form its own marketing strategy and product ecology.  
 
Slower external shipment process 
As we mentioned, BYD’s valuation reflects its external shipments of power batteries and 
IGBT modules. We expect BYD will start selling its NEV parts in 2021E. However, affected 
by COVID-19, the external supply process may be slower than expected in terms of product 
certification and business development. It may affect the short-term market sentiment even 
though the long-term shipment process will stay intact. 
 
Unexpected technology route change 
BYD placed major auto technology focus on BEV and PHEV. The Company is also making 
considerable investments in LFP based blade power batteries. If FEV or battery technology 
has a breakthrough and becomes market mainstream, BYD’s leading technology reserve 
and product streams will be flipped, and it will have material impacts on product sales and 
earnings performance of the Company.  
 
Policy support is less than expected 
NEV sales still heavily rely on purchase subsidy, as NEV is yet to reach cost-parity to ICE. 
Our short term NEV sales projection is based on the expectation of the enforcement of the 
double credit system from 2021E, while long term sales projection is based on the 
government’s NEV sales penetration rate target. If the government accelerates the existing 
subsidy reduction plan or changing the future NEV penetration outlook, it will have material
