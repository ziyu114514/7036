MSB’s net profit declined 25.4%/10.0% YoY in 2Q/1H20, largely due to soaring 
impairment charges of 60.9% YoY in 2Q20. Topline growth (revenue +9.9% 
YoY; PPoP +8.8% YoY) was still decent, albeit a sequential moderation. Same 
as most nationwide bank peers, MSB also accelerated NPL recognition and 
boosted risk reserves during the industry downturn. We like the banks’ robust 
credit expansion and fast recovery of retail loans, but relatively thin provision 
buffer and below-average capital adequacy ratio are major overhangs.    
 Results positives: 1) Healthy loan and deposit growth of 2.7%/3.8% 
QoQ. It was encouraging to see a pick-up in retail loan growth of 5.2% in 
2Q20, vs 1.8% in 1Q20. Mortgage and personal business loans were key 
drivers, and credit cards also saw a positive growth of 2.6% in 1H20. 2) Net 
interest income grew strongly by 20.1% YoY, on solid expansion of 
interest-earnings assets and YoY margin widening. 3) Effective tax rate 
dropped 3.8ppt YoY, given rising investments to tax-free government bonds.       
 Results negatives: 1) 2Q20 NIM narrowed 3bp QoQ to 1.92% based on 
our estimate. This was due to 13bp HoH loan yield contraction and 5bp HoH 
increase in deposit cost, more than offsetting the 40bp drop of interbank 
funding cost in 1H20. 2) Asset quality under pressure. NPL ratio surged 
14bp QoQ to 1.69%, and provision coverage slid 3.6ppt QoQ to 152%, one 
of the lowest in the sector. However, the bank tightened NPL recognition 
standards, as NPLs covered 125% of >90-day overdue loans as of 2Q20, up 
from 114% as of 4Q19. 3) 2Q20 cost-income ratio increased 0.7ppt YoY; 
4) Investment return declined 12.9% YoY, on bond trading and exchange 
losses. 5) Capital position weakened. CET1/total CAR dropped 72bp/38bp 
QoQ to 8.24%/12.72% on sluggish earnings and cash dividend payout. RWA 
density rose 2.7ppt QoQ to 78.7%. 
 Maintain HOLD and lower TP to RMB6.40. We cut FY20/21 earnings 
forecasts by 15-17%, to reflect lower NIM/fee income and higher credit cost 
assumptions. Our revised TP of RMB6.40 is based on 0.58x (from 0.64x) 
target P/B and FY20 BVPS of RMB10.96.
