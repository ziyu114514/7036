PAB’s 1H20 net profit declined 11.2% YoY to RMB13.7bn, implying 35.5% YoY 
shrink in 2Q20 earnings. The bottom line weakness mainly came from surging 
provisions (+57.6% YoY) in 2Q20, as the Bank followed regulatory initiative to 
build up loss reserves and hold back earnings expansion. However, its 
revenue/PPoP growth continued to outrun sector peers at 14.3%/18.4% YoY. 
With notable pick-up in provision coverage and stringent NPL recognition, PAB 
should see greater room to lower credit cost and unleash earnings potential 
when policy guidance effect wanes.  
 Results positives: 1) Credit extension was solid at 2.4% QoQ. Retail 
loan growth recovered to 3.6% in 2Q20 from 1Q20 stagnation, driven by 
mortgage (+6.0% QoQ), auto finance (+11.0% QoQ), and personal business 
loans (+15.1% QoQ). 2) Non-interest income rose 19.1% YoY in 2Q20, as 
net fee income gained 13.6% YoY, and trading and investment return grew 
34.2% YoY. As a result, revenue structure improved with 36.8% (+2.1ppt 
QoQ) non-interest income contribution; 3) Cost-income ratio fell 2.5ppt 
YoY to 27.7%, indicating better operating efficiency; 4) Asset quality 
remained healthy. NPL ratio was flat at 1.65%, and provision coverage 
climbed 15ppt QoQ to 215%, higher than joint-stock banks’ average of 204%. 
Credit card NPL ratio edged up 3bp QoQ, while corporate NPL ratio further 
slid 5bp QoQ. 5) Steady growth in retail client base. Number of 
retail/wealth/PB client rose 3.1%/7.7%/8.5% QoQ, and retail AUM increased 
8.6% QoQ to RMB2.32tn. 
 Results negatives: 1) Deposits shrank 3.1% QoQ, pushing LDR to 100%. 
Proportion of structured deposits stayed elevated at 22.4%. 2) 2Q20 NIM 
narrowed 1bp QoQ to 2.59%, as asset yield contraction outweighed 
funding cost retreat. 3) Capital adequacy ratio dropped, with 27bp/31bp 
QoQ decline in CET-1/total CAR, due to sluggish earnings and cash 
dividend payout in 2Q20.   
 Maintain BUY and trim TP to RMB18.9. We cut FY20/21 earnings forecast 
by 12-14%, as we lifted credit cost assumption by 20-24bp to reflect PAB’s 
prudent provisioning against potential asset quality deterioration. Our revised 
TP of RMB18.9 is based on 1.24x (from 1.28x) target P/B and FY20E BVPS 
of RMB15.3.
