Luxshare announced on 17 July that Luxshare and its parentco will acquire 100% 
of Wistron's two subsidiaries in Kunshan for a deal value of RMB3.3bn. Luxshare 
will invest no more than RMB600mn (7.2% of 1Q20 cash) for 18% stake of the 
assets. We think it will allow Luxshare to expand into iPhone assembly business 
as No.3 supplier (7-10% of share) behind Foxconn and Pegatron, and it is positive 
to Luxshare in long term given greater synergy with its other iPhone components 
(acoustics/haptics/wireless/LCP) and earnings upside after turning Wistron's 
OEM biz into profitability. We lifted FY20-22E EPS by 1-11 % to reflect better 
AirPods/Watch sales but does not factor in financial impact of this transaction. 
Reiterate BUY and lifted TP to RMB 74.2 based on rollover 42x FY21E P/E.  
 
Long-term synergy with Apple ecosystem; Limited financial impact in 
near term. We think the deal is a milestone for Luxshare to become a best-
in-class vertically-integrated Apple supplier covering both assembly and 
components for iPhone, AirPods and Watch. Leveraging its strong 
partnership with Apple, we think Luxshare will continue to gain share on 
existing iPhone components, such as acoustics, haptics, wireless charging 
and LCP modules. Given that Wistron’s iPhone OEM remains loss-making 
and no consolidation is required for Luxshare’s 18% stake, we expect limited 
financial impact in FY20-21E and we have not included in our forecasts yet. 
 
Implications to iPhone OEM supply chain. We estimate Wistron currently 
accounted for 7-10% share allocation of total iPhone shipment, lagging 
behind Foxconn/Pegatron (60%/30% share). After deal is closed by end-
FY20, we expect Wistron will focus on iPhone OEM in its India plant, while 
Luxshare will start to expand share in iPhone OEM in China, backed by its 
vertically-integrated supply chain and strong execution capability.  
 
Raise FY20-22E EPS by 1-11 % for better AirPods/Watch. In view of 
stronger AirPods/Watch demand and more positive iPhone outlook, we lifted 
FY20-22E EPS by 1-11% as we estimate Luxshare’s AirPods shipment to 
reach 69mn/85mn and Watch sales to reach RMB 6bn/9bn in FY20/21E.  
 Beneficiary of Apple supplier diversification; Raise TP to RMB 74.2. Our 
new TP of RMB 74.2 is based on rollover 42x FY21E P/E given strong 
earnings CAGR and promising growth profile in iPhone/AirPods/Watch. 
Upcoming catalysts include stronger AirPods and 5G iPhone launch.

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY and rasied TP to RMB 74.2 (35% upside) 
We derived our 12m TP of RMB 74.2 based on rollover 42x FY21E P/E. We believe this is 
justified as Luxshare continues to deliver strong earnings growth, market share gain and 
product expansion to capture 5G and wireless opportunities in next 3-5 years.   
Upcoming catalysts include stronger AirPods shipment, launch of iPhone in 2H20E and 
China 5G subs ramp. Major risks include weaker AirPods demand, weaker yield 
improvement and slower integration of acquired businesses.
