Strong quarter driven by both organic
growth and acquired assets
Growth acceleration continued in 3Q
Aier reported revenue/core proﬁt of RMB1.8bn/292m in 3Q17, representing YoY
growth of 54%/45% respectively, vs. 35%/34% in 1H17, and vs. 26%/19% for
revenue/core proﬁt in 2016. The company commented that organic growth of
revenue and core proﬁt was 28%/38% in 3Q17, vs. 31%/ 27% in 2Q17, and
vs. 24%/ 22% in 1Q17. Management attributes the robust revenue growth
to consolidation of newly-acquired subsidiaries (including Clinica Baviera) and
organic growth of existing hospitals. We expect further growth acceleration,
driven by contribution from new assets and solid existing business. We reiterate
Buy on high earnings sustainability and visibility.
Strong growth momentum for the three major segments
Sales growth of excimer surgery, cataract surgery, and optometry was estimated
to be 50%, 57%, and 37% in 3Q17, vs. 42%, 33%, and 30% in 1H17, and vs. 36%,
22%, and 37% in 2016, respectively. We believe the strong results were owing to
the growing need for ophthalmic services in China. On M&A, the Clinica Baviera
deal closed in August 2017 and is expected to add another leg of growth in 4Q17.
Margin improved in 3Q17
GM/OPM registered 50.6% and 25.4%, respectively, in 3Q17, vs. 48.5% and
22.1% in 3Q16. We attribute the margin expansion to the ramp-up of new
hospitals, economies of scale, and lower admin costs. We also highlight that
ﬁnance costs advanced 1324% YoY in 3Q17, resulting from a large amount
of borrowings for acquisitions. We believe the momentum in operating margin
improvement will continue with the contribution from new assets.
Increasing price target to RMB32.4 from RMB28.7; risks
Our target price is based on 26x EV/EBITDA of 2018E EBITDA, vs. the 25x we
used previously, due to sector re-rating. We believe 26x is justiﬁed, as its Asia-
listed peers are trading at 19x with 6% EBITDA growth in 2019E (vs. the 25% we
model for Aier). Key risks include delays in geographical expansion, execution risk
related to newly-acquired business, and slower ASP/ volume growth.

Takeaways from dbAccess China Healthcare Corporate
Day
We hosted Aier management on Friday, with the following key updates:
■
Hospital network: The company is well on track to reach the 200 hospital
target by YE17. As of Sep 2017, Aier has over 190 facilities under its
umbrella, with 78 consolidated in the listed company. Among the 78
hospitals, only 10 are loss-making, while the majority in the M&A fund
are not yet proﬁtable. Management expects to include another batch
from the M&A fund once they reached operational targets.
■
The partnership incentive program launched in 2014 was well structured,
as the break-even period shortened for newly-established hospitals.
Notably, prefecture level hospitals, if well managed, could break even
in year 1, record signiﬁcant proﬁt in year 2, then develop into a mature
hospital by year 3, while in general, it may take 2-3 years to break even
and record proﬁts. Management estimated 8-10 more hospitals to reach
the 100m revenue scale, compared with nine hospitals by YE16.
■
Growth acceleration was achieved for all major segments in 3Q17. We
highlight that cataract surgery posted highest growth with 57% in 3Q17,
vs. 33% in 1H17. Excimer and posteria segment surgery also performed
well, registering 51%/ 48% in 3Q17, compared to 41% and 36% in 1H17.
■
On growth, the company maintained guidance of 30% in the mid term,
via both organic growth and acquisitions. For existing hospitals, mature
ones such as Wuhan, Changsha could continue at 15% growth, or closer
to 20% for small-base hospitals. Proﬁt growth from these hospitals can
be over 20% YoY.
■
Aier will continue to review the opportunity for expanding its
international footprint and building synergies. The ideal collaboration will
enable Aier to export its products, while, in reverse, importing innovation/
technology into the home market, thereby defending its bellwether
status.
■
On geographical expansion, the company achieved decent results in
coastal tier 1 and 2 cities, especially for cities like Shenzhen, which
has a high percentage of migrant workers and incoming population. On
the contrary, Northern cities including Taiyuan are showing slower-than-
expected growth, on the back of barriers for promotion and patients/
physician education.
■
On ASP, Aier has not raised the ASP of individual surgery. However, the
company is witnessing a shift from low-ASP to high-ASP patient choice,
primarily in tier 1/2 cities. Aier believes the service mix change could
oﬀer further margin expansion opportunity for the China business.
■
For acquired overseas business: the US AW Vision contributed RMB26m
sales in 3Q, with approximately RMB6m of net proﬁt. We believe CB
might have generated a loss for the company.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
