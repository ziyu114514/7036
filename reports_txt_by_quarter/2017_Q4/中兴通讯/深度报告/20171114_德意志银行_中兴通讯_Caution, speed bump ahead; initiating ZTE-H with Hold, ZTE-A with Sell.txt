ZTE is well leveraged to grow in telco capex from 5G build-out starting in 2020. 
That said, current global appetite for large 5G capex is limited; while there is 
stronger political support for 5G tech in China, with limited application 
opportunities, we expect Chinese telcos to tread a middle path in the 5G build-
out. Short term, global telco capex is set to fall 5-7% p.a., although ZTE's 
competitors struggle with profitability, providing some room for share gains. 
With ZTE's share price doubling YTD against a tough market backdrop, upside 
potential appears mostly priced in; Hold ZTE-H and Sell ZTE-A. 
Limited applications to support a widespread 5G rollout 
Global telcos have expressed reservations about 5G, which likely reflect a 
combination of: 1) failure to monetize 4G, 2) reduced profitability and 3) limited 
viable applications requiring nationwide 5G. For many applications, e.g., video 
streaming and IoT, existing technology suffices; for others, e.g., robotics, needs 
can mostly be met by regional 5G rollout. For most global telcos around the 
world, we expect 5G networks to be deployed like islands in a sea of 4G. 
Stronger political support in China should see ZTE better placed 
There is stronger political support for a 5G build-out in China, with the 
government aiming to make the nation a networking powerhouse. Hence, 
Chinese telcos spend on 5G capex will likely be more than their international 
peers. Our bottom-up build suggests a total 5G capex in China of ~RMB1.5trn 
to be spent from 2020 (twice the estimated 4G spend), which would lead to 
c.RMB1.9trn in total capex spending between 2020 and 2024. This would drive 
a 30% lift in ZTE’s China carrier revenue in 2020 and a further 15% in 2021. 
Opportunities in the near term, but it is a tough environment 
In the near term, operating conditions for equipment vendors remain tough, 
with our global team expecting a 6-7% p.a. decline in telco capex (ex US) over 
the next two years. Issues at its major competitors present some opportunities 
for share gains for ZTE, i.e. teething integration issues and potentially 
excessive pricing discipline at Nokia and poor profitability at Ericsson. We have 
assumed a 2-3ppt p.a. market share increase for ZTE in the Asia Pacific and 
EMEA regions over the next three years to reflect these. In China, we see 
limited opportunities for ZTE to gain further material share prior to 5G, given its 
already dominant position with a 30-35% market share in wireless equipment.  
Many of these factors are priced in, with close to no upside potential for ZTE-A 
While ZTE has put the litigation issues in the US behind it, significant execution 
risks remain, given the competitive threat posed by Huawei. With ZTE-H 
trading in line with its peers (albeit expensive vs. its own long-run average 
12mth PE), and with ZTE-A valuation already implying a bullish scenario of 
share gain, margin lift and significant capex blowout in China (leaving little free 
cash flow for the telcos), we rate ZTE-H a Hold and ZTE-A a Sell. 
Valuation and risks  
PT based on mid-point of SoTP and DCF valuations (WACC 8.7%, TGR 1%). 
Upside risks: 1) keen 5G applications and 2) govet push to drive 5G spending. 
Downside: 1) share loss and 2) delays in formalizing 5G. See pp. 36–7.

Investment thesis 
 
5G lacking viable business cases: Telcos around the world are not 
willing to increase capex significantly for 5G, given limited viable 
business cases and subdued growth. 
 
Better prospects for 5G in China: The Chinese government is 
supportive of 5G, which will be helpful for ZTE. However, we do not 
believe the level of spending will be overwhelmingly high. We expect 
5G capex in China to total RMB1.5trn over 10 years. 
 
Opportunities offsetting challenges near-term for ZTE: In the near 
term, ZTE could benefit from issues at Nokia (integration) and Ericsson 
(poor profitability). However, it faces a declining market. There has 
also been limited evidence of market share gains outside of China. 
 
Valuation appears full: ZTE-H valuation appears full while ZTE-A is 
already factoring in a bullish 5G build-out scenario in China. 
 
Lack of enthusiasm for 5G globally 
To date, most telcos across the globe have been lukewarm towards 5G, 
reflecting a combination of: 
 
Declining profitability and limited evidence of 4G monetization; 
 
Lack of compelling business applications, e.g. unlike 4k, 8k video 
cannot be discerned with the naked eye, AR/VR is still nascent;  
 
Existing technologies may be good enough in most cases, e.g., 
Massive MIMO for bandwidth and NB-IoT for IoT and 
 
High cost involved in building a national 5G network, given the higher 
spectrum frequencies involved.

The telcos operators have made the following comments on 5G investments: 
 
China Mobile chairman: We will not blindly invest in 5G without viable 
business applications, and there are no such viable applications under 
5G at the moment; 
 
China Unicom chairman: 5G will co-exist with 4G for a long time, and 
it is different when migrating from 2G to 4G than from 4G to 5G. 5G 
remains just a story at the moment; 
 
MTS (Russia) chief marketing officer: There is no business case behind 
it, and it is not in our business plan for 2017 or 2018; 
 
Deutsche Telecom chief technology officer: 4G will evolve further, and it 
is not going to be a big bang with 5G. Greater industry collaboration is 
needed to reduce the cost of rolling out a 5G radio network and some 
established vendors may not survive the transition from 4G to 5G; 
 
DoCoMo management: We would like to see capex decline up until 
FY19 and then flat from FY20 onwards. 
 
Singtel CEO: It is too early to discuss 5G while 4G remains 
unmonetized. 
Hence at this stage, we expect 5G networks to be islands in a sea of 4G. 
 
Better prospects for 5G in China 
We see better prospects for 5G investments in China, due to strong 
government support for the tech industry and its over-arching aim of making 
the country an IT and networking powerhouse. With that said, we also see a 
number of moderating factors, including: 
 
The need to improve SOE returns: the government wants to improve 
SOE’s returns, reduce unwanted supply and for all telcos to have profit 
targets on which they need to deliver;

ZTE-A and -H 
 
Page 6

 
Telecom infrastructure has caught up: the Chinese telcos have 
invested a significant amount in the past and the state of Chinese 
telecom infrastructure has caught up with (and even exceeded) many 
of its international peers;

 
Unbalanced competitive strength in the telecom sector, with China 
Mobile still making the lion’s share of industry profits. A drive to spend 
significantly on the network would invariably tip the competitive 
balance against smaller players, given their lower margins and weaker 
financial strength. 
We believe the government will likely factor in the needs of all stakeholders in 
its considerations, and given the limited global support for 5G, we expect 
Chinese telcos to be somewhat cautious in capex spending. We estimate that 
in aggregate Chinese telcos will likely spend RMB1.5trn on 5G over 2020-2030, 
a level sufficient for nationwide coverage by 2030, but not so exorbitant that 
every corner of the country would be covered by high bandwidth 5G. 
The table below shows our forecasts of total 5G capex in China. We have used 
7m base stations as the basis for coverage achieved by 2024, which is based 
on the current number of 4G base stations multiplied by two to account for the 
higher frequencies used, partially offset by the larger bandwidth offered. 
Our 2030 target assumes a higher number of base stations for improved 
coverage and higher bandwidth needs, offset by declining base station prices.

The total capex under 5G based on our forecasts imply 2x the level of capex 
spent on 4G to achieve an equivalent level of coverage. The total capex for 
Chinese telcos and the implied share of China carrier revenue forecasts are 
shown below.

Using the forecast telco capex as our base, we forecast a significant uplift in 
ZTE’s China carrier revenue in 2020 from a combination of: a) an increase in 
5G capex and b) an increase in market share, as has been the experience in the 
past. These are set out below.

Opportunities offsetting challenges near-term 
The near-term industry outlook is challenging for telecom equipment vendors, 
due to a declining capex outlook, including China. We estimate global capex 
(ex US) to decline at a rate of 6-7% p.a. over the next two years.

However, two of ZTE’s key competitors are having issues of their own: Nokia 
in terms of integrating with Alcatel, and Ericsson with profitability. 
Furthermore, with the number of competitors reduced (due to the Nokia and 
Alcatel merger) and Huawei becoming dominant globally, there is an 
opportunity for the number four player (i.e., ZTE) to increase its market share, 
particularly in the EMEA and Asia Pacific regions, which are generally more 
receptive to Chinese equipment vendors. 
We have assumed a 2-3 ppt p.a. improvement in ZTE’s EMEA and Asia Pacific 
market share over the next three years to reflect the above factors, which we 
believe is more than adequate.

the PE multiple above the long-run average, albeit in line with its long-run 
relativity vs. other telecom equipment vendors.

As shown above, ZTE-A would still be trading on ~15x FY20 PE assuming: 
 
Chinese telcos’ capex reaches 30% of revenue by 2020, a level that 
would leave them with little free cash flow over the next five years,  
 
ZTE’s net profit margin rises to 6% from the current rate of 4%, a level 
it has yet to achieve in its history and 
 
Its share of Chinese telco capex rises to 15%.

5G as it stands is not a 
blockbuster 
Each change in mobile technology generation brings with it upgrades to 
network functionalities and is typically a time for equipment vendors to 
monetize their research efforts as new network equipment replaces the old. 
However, as it currently stands, 5G does not appear to be a blockbuster for 
equipment vendors as 4G is good enough for most applications and few of the 
applications currently would potentially require a nationwide 5G rollout. 
Furthermore many telcos around the world are struggling to generate growth 
and hence do not have the financial appetite for a new wave of capex, 
particularly given the limited monetization benefits of their 4G investments. 
In this section, we look at: 
 
The 5G criteria  
 
Potential application scenarios; and 
 
Evidence of why global telcos are not keen on 5G. 
 
What is 5G, briefly? 
From the first generation (1G) mobile technology to 4G, each generation of 
mobile technology has resulted in a substantial improvement in the way that 
telecommunication services are provided. 2G allowed small amounts of data 
(including messages) to be transmitted in addition to voice communication, 3G 
and 4G allowed significantly more data to be transmitted, and 4G enabled 
“things” to be connected.

Each generation of mobile technology is also defined by different 
communication standards and performance requirements as shown above.  
The communication standards and performance specifications for the fifth 
generation of mobile technologies (5G) have yet to be formally defined, 
although there is some consensus on what 5G would be able to achieve. The 
GSM Association (which represents mobile operators’ interests globally) 
identified a set of eight requirements for 5G technology as shown below.

The improvement in performance of 5G vs. 4G revolves around three main 
aspects: 
 
Improved data download speed (enhanced mobile broadband) 


It is worth noting that not all these requirements will need to be met at the 
same time across a network. Rather, various combinations of a subset of the 
above requirements will be supported “when and where it matters”. For 
example, it is unnecessary to have download speeds of 20Gbps for typical 
industrial sensors, but they may need to be run with low-energy usage and a 
large number of them may need to be connected in a small area. 
 
5G will be for industrial internet… eventually 
While previous generations of mobile technology have significantly improved 
consumer adoption and experience in using their mobile devices, enterprise 
applications of mobile technology have so far been limited. It is hoped that 5G 
will be a key enabler of many enterprise applications, such as: 
 
Internet of things (IoT), which will require the large number of 
connections afforded by 5G; 
 
Robotics (and tactile internet), which will be enabled by the precise 
and low latency properties of a 5G network; 
 
Big data: with significant volumes of data coming from connected 
devices such as sensors, vehicles (e.g. self-driving cars); and 
 
Cloud computing (and artificial intelligence) with large processing 
capabilities stored in data centers in remote locations.

With enterprises being the dominant target customer group for 5G technology, 
it is hoped that telcos will be able to monetize their 5G network investments 
better than in the past. We suspect that typical conversations between telcos 
and their enterprise customers will sound like these: 
9 November 2017

ZTE-A and -H

 
We will save you $10m in labor costs by installing these sensors / 
robots, and each year we will charge you $100k for the network 
usage, a fraction of the costs saved;  
 
The driverless car costs $1m but it may need to upload 1,000GB of 
data per day. We will charge the car company $10k for 10 years of 
data usage, a small fraction of the price of the car;  
 
These robotics arms installed for surgeons/technicians will save them 
10 trips a year; for linking this service to the 5G network, we charge 
$10k a year, which is still cheaper than the $100k required for 
travelling. 
For these reasons in the long run, we see better monetization opportunities for 
telcos under 5G than under 4G, which mostly just improves the download 
speed of mobile handsets without attracting new customers to mobile 
operators.

No current need for a widespread 5G rollout  
While we share some of the excitement around what the future technology 
may entail, early application scenarios under 5G would merely enhance the 
mobile broadband experience. As it currently stands, we do not see the need 
for a 5G build-out at a similar pace or coverage to the 4G network, since the 
4G technology is good enough in some of these scenarios or the 5G 
technology or application scenario is not sufficiently mature to require a 
nationwide rollout. We explore these factors below.

Existing 4G technology is good enough 
 
The enhancement to the video viewing experience on a mobile phone 
is limited when stepping up from HD to 4K/8K, given the small display 
screen. We suspect a 5G network is more likely to be used as a 
marketing gimmick by telecom operators, particularly in the initial 
stages of the build-out.  
 
Most of the IoT applications are likely to run on the NB-IoT standard 
under 4G for some time. In fact the 5G IoT standard won’t be ready 
until Release 16 in 2019.  
No need for a nationwide rollout of 5G network 
 
Cutting-edge technologies, such as robotics and e-health, remain 
expensive and can be satisfied by a limited rollout of the 5G network, 
focusing mostly on Tier 1 cities or specific regions and supplemented 
by Wi-Fi and fixed broadband.  
 
For self-driving cars, we do not think the mission-critical components 
will be reliant on the 5G network, given improved processing power 
and the significant litigation risks associated should accidents occur. 
While there is significant data upload needs for self-driving cars, this 
should be done when there is a 5G or Wi-Fi network available (e.g. in 
city areas). Furthermore some sources indicate that the level of data 
uploads could reach around 3,000GB per day (e.g. CSIA) for a self-
driving car. With the average fixed broadband user using only 20-
50GB per month, other methods may need to be contemplated. 
 
Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications will require 
the support of a 5G network, but it’s still early days for these 
technologies. With VR taking some time to take off despite the initial 
launch hype, we think some degree of skepticism is in order. 
Furthermore, we expect the usage of AR and VR to be most likely 
focused on city areas and the more affluent regions. 
A nationwide rollout of 5G network will be much more expensive than 4G 
Currently typical 4G spectrum frequencies are 700MHz, 900MHz and 
1800MHz, while the lowest frequency currently allocated for 5G is 3500MHz. 
As a rule of thumb, the 1800MHz spectrum covers around double the distance 
of the 3500MHz. Hence, to achieve the same level of coverage, the number of 
5G base stations required will be 3-4x. Furthermore, building a standalone 5G 
network may require further significant investments in the fiber backhaul.

Relativity between number of base stations required for coverage

There are some offsets: the use of beam forming techniques can increase 
propagation distance and, given their higher bandwidth capacity, 5G base 
stations can reduce the number of base stations required in high-density areas.  
Furthermore some uncertainties remain around the spectrum to be used for 
5G, with different frequencies proposed by different countries. Ultimately some 
of the 2G/3G spectrum in lower frequencies may be re-allocated to 5G later. 
 
Struggling telcos generally cautious about 5G spending 
The investing intentions of telcos in the 5G era are generally subdued as telco 
profitability and growth stall and with evidence of 4G monetization generally 
limited for telcos.

Upgrade path for 5G 
There are two broad deployment scenarios for 5G networks: standalone and 
non-standalone. A standalone network is newly built and includes new base 
stations, backhaul links and a core network, while a non-standalone network 
piggy-backs on the existing infrastructure (e.g. adding new aerials and 
modules to existing base stations).  
Standalone offers better performances as well as less complexity from legacy 
LTE integration but is more expensive in the early commercial stage. According 
to GSMA, operators in China are more inclined to take the standalone route 
while operators in other countries are likely to opt for a non-standalone 
approach in the early stages. 
A 5G build-out would most likely require:

 
New base stations or upgrades to existing base stations (e.g. new 
aerials), depending on whether a standalone or non-standalone 5G 
network is being built and whether the base stations would readily 
accommodate 5G equipment; 
 
New routers and backhaul, or upgrades to existing backhaul, to 
accommodate the increase in data usage; and 
 
New core network (Evolved Packet Core) for the new functionalities 
offered for the standalone 5G while the existing core network may be 
used for non-standalone 5G.

ZTE 5G revenue growth forecasts (outside of China) 
The following table shows our forecasts for ZTE’s revenue growth outside of 
China for 2020 and beyond. We have assumed a combination of market share 
gains and a reasonable capex increase under 5G but a later rollout date of 
2021 for the global telcos. We discuss the near-term forecasts in a later 
section.

Better support for 5G in 
China 
While there is a general reluctance by telcos around the world to increase 
capex for 5G, the prospect is better in China as: 
 
Chinese telcos will likely adopt a standalone 5G network, which is 
higher in cost; and 
 
There is general support by the Chinese government to lead 
internationally in terms of its IT and network infrastructure, and to 
facilitate the development of technology related companies. 
At the end of the day, we believe Chinese telcos will likely tread the middle line 
in terms of capex spending and estimate that they will spend in aggregate 
RMB1.5trn on 5G over 2020-2030. However, we do not see a capex blowout in 
the face of moderating factors, including the need to deliver profit targets for 
telco operators. 
ZTE, which has bigger exposure to the Chinese telecom capex cycle, should 
benefit more than global equipment vendors. We explore these issues, our 5G 
capex forecasts for China and its implications for ZTE below. 
 
Chinese telcos will likely tread the middle path on 5G capex 
The Chinese government has long been supportive of the country’s technology 
sector with companies such as ZTE enjoying a lower tax rate and government 
grants (ZTE for example receives ~RMB1bn in grants each year). This message 
was reiterated at the recent 19th National Congress with the government 
aiming to make China a global IT and networking powerhouse.  
The government would have also been proud of the achievements that Huawei 
has made on the international stage and the country’s increased ownership of 
global mobile communication standards. Hence, some pressure is likely by the 
government on Chinese telcos to invest earlier and at a larger scale on 5G than 
international peers.  
That said, we see some moderating factors, including: 
 
The need to improve SOE returns: the government wants to improve 
SOEs’ returns and reduce unwanted supply, and the reform actions at 
China Unicom suggest a desire to improve telco sector returns; 
 
Telecom infrastructure has caught up: Chinese telcos already invested 
significantly in the past and the state of Chinese telecom infrastructure 
has 
caught 
up 
with 
(and 
even 
exceeded) 
many 
of 
its 
international peers; 
 
One national champion is enough? China has already had significant 
success in promoting Huawei as a global powerhouse. Hence there 
9 November 2017 
Telecommunications 
ZTE-A and -H 
 
Page 20

may be less motivation to lend support to a similar equipment 
manufacturer beyond the level provided in the past. 
 
China already has a strong say in international standards, with Time 
Division (TD) now a globally recognized standard under 4G and this is 
likely to form a core component of the 5G standards; 
 
Unbalanced competitive strength in the telecom sector, with China 
Mobile still making the lion’s share of industry profits. A drive to spend 
significantly on the network would invariably tip the competitive 
balance against smaller players, given their lower margins and weaker 
financial strength.

The table below shows our forecasts for total 5G capex in China. We expect 
total 5G capex to be around twice that of 4G, to reflect the higher frequency, 
offset by improving technology (e.g. higher propagation) and declining 
equipment pricing over time.

 
We assume a total of 7m 5G base stations being deployed over five 
years based on 3.5m 4G base stations as at 1H17 (where the major 
operators already have 85-95% 4G network coverage), multiplied by 
two to account for the lower penetration of the high frequency 5G 
spectrum, partially offset by the larger bandwidth offered.

We assume the number of base stations required doubles from 7m in 
2024 to 15m in 2030, to account for increased data usage, partially 
offset by a decline in ASP due to improvement in technology.

Our 5G capex forecasts are lower than CAICT’s (a think-tank for the MIIT) 
forecasts in their 5G White Paper (published in June 2017 and shown above), 
particularly after 2022. We do not think the CAICT capex forecasts are 
reasonable (particularly those beyond 2022) at the moment, given the limited 
number of use cases for 5G. Applying such a hefty capex burden would imply 
that the Chinese telcos would hardly generate any free cash flows in FY22-24, 
2-3 years after 5G launch when the telcos would have already tested the 
waters in terms of user demand for the services.

Implied Chinese telco overall capex forecasts 
The following chart summarizes our telco capex forecasts. Backhaul capacity 
upgrade is assumed to occur at a constant pace and here we assume a 5% 
p.a. increase in spend each year. We forecast 2020 and 2021 being the peak 
years in terms of total 5G spend, averaging RMB200bn p.a. which is in line 
with the peak wireless capex in 2015. While our total capex spend is less than 
the 2015 peak, this accounts for the following two factors: 1) RMB28bn of the 
wireless capex is spent on 2G/3G by CU, and 2) the operators no longer need 
to spend on fiber for the last mile fixed broadband access in 2020.

The implied capex to sales ratio for the telecom operators beyond FY17, based 
on our forecasts, is around 23% which is 8ppts lower than the past, though we 
note that their EBITDA margin is also 8ppts lower than the past, as shown 
below.

How would a 5G build-out benefit vendors like ZTE? 
For ZTE, we estimate that 39% of its revenue is exposed to the domestic 
telecom capex cycle, while 19% of its revenue is exposed to the global capex 
cycle, as at FY16. Its leverage to the Chinese telecom capex cycle has 
increased in recent years, due to the increased scale of the Chinese telcos.

ZTE China carrier revenue forecasts under 5G 
Our forecasts for the equipment vendor revenue from the Chinese telecom 
operators are shown in the following charts. We forecast a 30% increase in 
ZTE’s China carrier revenue in FY20 and another 15% increase in FY21. 
We assume some market share gain for ZTE during the 5G era, however this is 
unlikely to be a one-way street where the local Chinese vendors continue to 
take share. Nokia has a JV in China, for example, which is 50%-owned by the 
state and, furthermore, we expect the operators to also want to leave some for 
the overseas vendors to retain competitive tension.

We also note that the equipment vendors’ revenue as a % of telco capex has 
increased noticeably in recent periods, as the equipment and software 
component of capex increases and as telco capex no longer includes tower 
constructions, which are now being carried out by the TowerCo. Hence, we 
have used the more recent years as a better guide for the relativity between 
equipment vendor revenue vs. telco capex.

Opportunities and 
challenges near term 
Before the 5G build-out arrives, the growth outlook is challenging with telco 
capex set to fall in China and globally over the next 2-3 years. That said, with 
ZTE’s US regulatory issue having resolved and its European counterparts 
looking to improve their profitability, ZTE has the opportunity to lift its market 
share. 
In the following section, we look at the growth outlook in the next 2-3 years 
before 5G arrives and we outline the various risks (both upside and downside) 
that we see to ZTE’s near-term earnings. 
 
Telco capex spend slowing 
Globally, we estimate that telco capex will decline 3-5% p.a. over the next two 
years, as the pace of 4G and fiber rollouts slows. North America is the only 
region where we expect to see a rise in telco capex; however, it is the region 
where ZTE has the least potential for growth. Excluding North America, we 
expect the capex of telcos in the other regions to fall 6-7% p.a. 
Figure 58: Global wireless capex forecasts

For Chinese telcos, the picture is no different with their capex set to fall ~5% 
p.a. over the next three years.

With a challenging near-term outlook for the telecom capex cycle, the biggest 
opportunity for growth for ZTE would be via market share gains, which we 
explore in the following section. 
 
Market share gain opportunities  
The equipment vendors have limited segmental disclosures around their 
operating businesses, we believe for competitive reasons. While some 
independent data sources are available, differences still exist and the data are 
often overly segmented and do not include a holistic picture of the providers. 
Hence we look at market share based on reported revenue by the equipment 
providers on the basis that they have similar competencies and would be 
competing against each other on similar contracts. 
On this basis, ZTE appears to be slowly gaining share in China, which is 
leading to an increase in global market share, while Huawei is the one that is 
consistently gaining share from the other vendors.

We do note that ZTE has lost share in the government and enterprise segment, 
which may be the result of recent regulatory issues as well as changes in their 
strategy – i.e. moving away from package solutions to equipment sales only.  
Profit focus from the global peers providing an opportunity for share gain 
We see some opportunities for ZTE to gain market share from the likes of 
Nokia and Ericsson, due to the following: 
 
Ericsson’s focus on return to profitability may see the loss of some 
less profitable customers; 
 
Nokia bedding down its acquisitions of Alcatel may see some 
customer attrition; 
 
ZTE’s product and execution capabilities have improved. Our channel 
checks in China suggest limited quality difference in the 4G RAN 
product between the top four equipment vendors; 
 
The Chinese government provides financial support to the equipment 
vendors which allows ZTE to charge lower prices than the overseas 
peers; 
 
The desire by telco operators to maintain a reasonable degree of 
competitive tension between the equipment providers with the loss of 
one competitor in the market (i.e., Alcatel Lucent) and with Huawei 
becoming ever more dominant.

More share gain opportunities in EMEA and Asia Pacific 
We see limited opportunities for ZTE to gain further material market shares in 
China. Our channel checks suggest that ZTE already has a 30-35% market 
share in the radio access network business, in line with Huawei. While ZTE’s 
market share in optical equipment and routers are lower, Huawei’s dominance 
in these markets may make any material market share gain more difficult. 
However, there may be more opportunities in EMEA (Europe in particular) and 
in Asia Pacific. As shown below, ZTE has less than 5% share in the EMEA 
regions and has recently had some more high profile contract wins such as the 
cooperation with Orange in its pre-5G trial and with Wind Italy in its 4G 
deployment. Meanwhile, some of the Asian telcos are still rolling out their 4G 
networks, which provides some room for market share gains.

The following table summarizes the revenue pie for each region. We see the 
biggest upside for ZTE in the EMEA and Asia Pacific region, given ZTE’s small 
market share, and with Huawei’s success in the region, it is likely that the 
telcos there would be accommodative of ZTE’s approach.  
If we assume ZTE gains 3ppts in market share in the EMEA and Asia Pacific 
region, this translates into a 10% increase in its overall revenue. Hence, there 
does appear to be some material upside if ZTE was to gain market share.

Execution risks remain 
Despite the upside from market share gains, we do think significant execution 
risks remain for ZTE to deliver on the above. In particular, ZTE has not shown 
itself to be able to gain market share outside of China, and Huawei may end up 
scooping up more share as it has done in the past. 
Furthermore, winning contracts in overseas markets may result in margin 
dilution as ZTE uses pricing as a lever to get its foot in the door on some key 
customers.

We assume that ZTE’s carrier revenue growth in China is relatively flat over the 
next three years due to its high market share and as the domestic telcos’ capex 
declines. We have allowed for 2-3ppt p.a. market share in EMEA and Asia 
Pacific for ZTE over the next three years, which we believe is more than 
adequate, given its track record to-date.

Employee share scheme provides confidence in earnings  
ZTE’s employee share scheme stipulates that ZTE delivers ~10% p.a. in net 
profit growth off an adjusted FY16 net profit over the next three years and an 
ROE of 10% or above.

The existence of the share scheme could see ZTE selling off some of its core 
assets faster in the near term to prop up its earnings should there be hiccups in 
its revenue growth. As such, this may see its share price supported at current 
levels before more clarity on the 5G build-out emerges.

Long-term disrupters: SDN 
and NFV 
Telecom equipment providers historically sell hardware with embedded and 
dedicated software components. Typically, equipment providers make very 
little margin on the initial hardware implementation phase in the hope of 
recouping the cost via future software upgrades which have significantly 
higher margins. 
Network functions virtualization (NFV) is a move by telecom operators to 
disaggregate software and hardware within telecom equipment, in order to 
improve efficiency and flexibility. This unbundling process, however, may 
result in reduced profitability for the equipment providers as the more lucrative 
software business becomes more open to disruption and competition from 
dedicated software providers.  
The evidence of disruption is relatively limited so far, but may become a major 
headwind in the longer term, as NFV and SDN are essential in enabling some 
of the 5G functionalities (e.g. network slicing). Our European team, led by Rob 
Sanders, has delved into this issue in significant detail for the European 
equipment names in the note “Telco Cloud – Resistance is futile”. We explore 
the issue briefly in the following section. 
 
What are NFV and SDN? 
Network functions virtualization (NFV) was created in 2012 by telcos that were 
frustrated, as existing hardware had limited their ability to speed up 
deployment of new services, as the network functions are carried out by 
embedded software in proprietary hardware. NFV disaggregates software and 
hardware with network functions being run in software via virtualization 
techniques and then run on commoditized hardware (e.g. a standardized 
server). This allows network resources to be divided into individual channels 
which can operate independently, enabling virtual applications to be quickly 
implemented without the delays that come from installing new equipment. 
NFV then allows telecom operators to improve resource utilization, reduce 
hardware purchasing costs, reduce opex and provides the ability to launch 
services more quickly. 
Software defined networking (SDN) is a related concept that looks to promote 
an open network architecture by centralizing the software that controls the 
various network components, which would have previously been controlled by 
its own consoles and commands. The end-result is to enable an open 
multivendor ecosystem that allow automation of IT tasks.  
NFV and SDN, hence, are complementary concepts that promote an open and 
flexible network architecture. That said, the virtualization of network functions 
does not rely on SDN technologies and vice versa.

How could they disrupt value in the equipment vendors? 
For an equipment vendor like ZTE, the implications are mostly negative: 
 
Until now, equipment vendors have preferred to sell equipment as an 
integrated device, essentially as a closed black box. They have then 
managed the pace of upgrades, with upgrades often the highest 
margin sale within the customer lifecycle. With NFV/SDN, the 
operating system can be supplied by a third party or internally and the 
hardware sales are likely to decline.  
 
The promotion of open standards means that vendors are not locked 
in, hence making it easier to switch vendors in the future. 
 
The unbundling of the software and hardware components also invite 
competition from the large software vendors.  
 
While software sales from equipment vendors may rise, this is unlikely 
to offset the loss from hardware sales. Overall margin is likely to be 
permanently depressed for the industry. 
As shown below, DB’s global team expects up to 20% revenue erosion from 
NFV and SDN adoption by 2025.

Attitude of the telcos? 
We do note that currently SDN is occurring at the core and backhaul level only 
and the radio access networks (“RAN”) equipment are still sold as “black 
boxes”. That said, a number of telcos have long-term goals of increasing the 
penetration of SDN/NFV in their network architecture, which could see the 
level of disruption increase over time. 
The following table below summarizes NFV/SDN targets made by some of the 
large telcos globally.

Source: Deutsche Bank, Company Data 
Our channel checks so far suggest that there remains some resistance to the 
adoption of NFV and SDN by the telecom operators (noticeably China) due to: 
 
Difficulty in implementing SDN concepts at the base station level; 
 
A lack of visible cost savings due to the costs associated with renting 
mini data centers to store the servers and additional maintenance 
associated; and 
 
Lack of interoperability and issues integrating with legacy equipment. 
This issue is a risk for the likes of ZTE in the long run and is worth monitoring.

We value ZTE based on the mid-point of our DCF and peer-based P/E 
valuation. Our DCF valuation is HKD26.40/share, based on the following 
assumptions. TGR is 1%, below GDP growth given the lower earnings growth 
of the telecom operators. We assume ZTE will grow generally in line with 
telcos long-run revenue growth.

Risks 
The key upside risks include: 
 
The government pushing for an earlier 5G rollout, e.g. if the 5G license 
is given out in early 2019; 
 
The government stipulating larger-than-expected spend on 5G; 
 
Higher-than-expected market share gains; 
 
The advent of a “killer” application that requires large-scale 5G 
network build-out, e.g. the proliferation of Augmented Reality 
applications; 
 
Larger-than-expected margin improvement. 
The key downside risks include: 
 
Market share losses; 
 
Delay in formalizing the 5G standards; 
 
Reluctance from telecom operators to spend on 5G; 
 
Increase in competitive intensity.

We are 3-5% below Bloomberg consensus forecasts – with FY17 earnings 
having benefitted from ~RMB2bn in marked-to-market gains on the Nubia 
sale, it does make growth in FY18 more difficult to achieve. That said, ZTE has 
historically had lump investment income from sales of subsidiaries which 
could help cushion the earnings gap in future years.

taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication

or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company

the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
