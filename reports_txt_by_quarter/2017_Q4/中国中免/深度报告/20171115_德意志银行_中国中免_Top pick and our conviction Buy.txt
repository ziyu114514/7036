We raise our target price for CITS by 37.5% to RMB55, from RMB40. 
Management has publicly guided that its duty-free business is likely to see 
growth of over 60% yoy for FY2017. Also, we believe consensus hasn’t 
factored in profit from Beijing Airport, the potential opening of a downtown 
duty-free store and the consolidation of duty-free in Shanghai Airport. Given its 
robust and sustainable growth, high barriers to entry and attractive valuation, 
CITS has become our conviction Buy for 2018. 
Profit from BCIA should be higher than the consensus estimate 
We expect RMB6.6bn duty-free sales from BCIA (T2 & T3) in 2018. We believe 
the market is overly concerned with the high concessionaire rate from Beijing 
Airport: 1) during the transitional 12m, CITS will pay the original concessionaire 
rate agreed with Sunrise, and 2) there is still room for GM improvement, given 
the size-up (CITS’ duty-free GP margin was only c.45% vs. Dufry’s 60% in 
2016). We estimate RMB623m profit contribution for 2017 and RMB349m for 
2018. We believe this has not been factored into WIND/Bloomberg consensus.  
Haitang Bay’s robust growth may continue all the way to 2020 
We have grown more confident on Haitang Bay duty-free sales after our recent 
channel checks. We expect duty-free sales to hit RMB6.55bn in 2017, yoy 
growth of 43%, and to grow another 28% in 2018. Our channel check found 
that there are two new additions of luxury hotel resorts (new supply of 800-
1,000 rooms) in Haitang Bay every year to meet the strong demand from 
domestic travelers. We also believe Atlantis and Haichang Ocean Park, two in-
progress theme parks could add another 5-6m travelers to Haitang Bay. All 
these incremental travelers should benefit duty-free sales’ long-term growth.  
Two more significant catalysts may double current profit – not priced in yet 
We believe the current share price hasn’t fully factored in two near-mid-term 
catalysts: a downtown duty-free store and consolidation of duty-free business 
in Shanghai Pudong/Hongqiao Airports. These two events are likely to bring a 
further c.RMB1.2bn in earnings to CITS, which is 35% on top of our 2018E.  
Valuation and risks 
Our TP of RMB55 implies a forward PER of 24x on our 2018 earnings 
forecasts, which we believe is very attractive, given that the duty-free business 
is protected and enjoys barriers to entry in China. We derive our TP based on 
DCF (8.1% WACC, 9% cost of equity, beta of 0.9 and 3.0% TGR, unchanged). 
Key downside risks include 1) unfavorable government policy, 2) ecommerce 
competition, 3) delays in lifting shopping quota, and 4) competition from OTAs.

Beijing Airport profit seems 
under-estimated 
Profit from BCIA seems higher than consensus 
Concessionaire rate followed previous agreement during 6+6 transitional 
period 
We believe the market is overly concerned about the high concessionaire rate 
(c.43.5% for T3 and 47.5% for T2) from Beijing Airport. As per management 
disclosure on the 3Q17 earnings conference call, CITS will pay the original 
concessionaire rate (c.20-30%) agreed with Sunrise during the next transitional 
6-12 months.  
Consensus has not fully factored in profit from BCIA  
CITS seems to be more aggressive after taking over the operations of Beijing 
Airport by introducing more international cosmetic brands to meet consumers’ 
desire to trade-up. As a result, we expect its top line to post a c.20% CAGR 
during 2017-2019E and there will likely be improvement in the gross margin, 
driven by the size-up.  
As a result, we expect duty-free sales from BCIA (T2 & T3) to deliver RMB6.6bn 
in 2018E and we estimate it could contribute an incremental RMB623m in 
profit (concessionaire rate of 25%) for 2017E and c.RMB350m (concessionaire 
rate of 36%) for 2018E.

Haitang Bay’s long-term 
growth looks more firm 
Expect visitor CAGR in Haitang Bay to be 20% 2017-19E 
2017 YTD, visitor growth in Sanya is 12% yoy.  
According to Sanya City Statistics, the number of tourists who stay overnight 
increased by 12.2% yoy to 12.8 million in 9M17. We expect Sanya to enjoy 
15% traffic growth in 2018-2019E as shown in the chart below. Haitang Bay is 
a comprehensive tourist destination with a shopping mall, resort and 
entertainment. Therefore, we expect Haitang Bay’s tourists will register a 20% 
CAGR in 2018-2019E as more people are willing to stay there.  
Figure 2: Overnight stay tourist traffic in Sanya

New addition of hotel supply in Haitang Bay is sufficient 
Currently, visitors to Haitang Bay rarely have any night life, except to stay in 
the hotel resorts. As it is the only shopping mall in Haitang Bay, we believe 
most overnight visitors will visit the mall for shopping/fun in the evening. 
Therefore, we also have channel-checked the luxury hotel resort pipeline in 
Haitang Bay.   
On average, three more new luxury hotels opening every year  
As shown in the table below, more than 10 luxury hotel resorts will start 
business in Haitang Bay over the next three years. We have seen incremental 
hotel room numbers of c.800-1,000 every year to accommodate the robust 
growth of visitors in Haitang Bay. Normally, CITS will work with these hotels 
on shuttle bus arrangements.

Three more leisure resorts/parks to extend visitors’ stay 
As we mentioned earlier, most visitors have no leisure events in the evening, 
other than to spend time in the hotel resorts. We believe two more thematic 
park/resorts will further extend visitors’ stay length in Haitang Bay. 
1) Atlantis to open in early 2018E 
The world's third Atlantis Hotel Resort is scheduled to open at the beginning of 
2018. Atlantis is only 3km away from the duty-free shopping mall. Therefore, 
we believe the establishment of Atlantis will direct sufficient visitors towards 
the shopping mall.  
 
Atlantis Resort is not only a luxury hotel (with 1,314 rooms) but also a 
water park, located only 3km from the Haitang Bay duty-free shopping 
mall.  
 
We expect Atlantis to attract an incremental 3-4 million visitors to the 
Haitang Bay area in 2018E 
2) Haichang Dream World will start operations in early-2019E 
Haichang Dream World is scheduled to start operation by the end of 2018E.  
 
The project is invested by Haichang Ocean Park (2255.HK, Non-rated), 
a leading developer and operator of ocean theme parks in China.  
 
Management disclosed that Haichang theme park is expected to 
attract c.5-6 million tourists in its mature stage.  
3) Island project in Haitang Bay DFS open in 2019E 
The Island project is owned by CITS, and is opposite the current duty-free 
shopping mall. The Island project is positioned to be an entertainment complex 
comprising catering, dining and entertainment. The Haitang Bay Island project 
will start operation by the end of 2018E.  
 
CITS has invested RMB840m in the construction of the Island project.

 
As the ancillary commercial property for Haitang Bay DFS, the Island 
project mainly focuses on providing catering and entertainment 
facilities for traffic from Haitang Bay. 
 
Management disclosed that the project has been under construction 
since the beginning of 2017 and it plans to start operations by the end 
of 2018E.

Two potential catalysts 
Two more catalysts could double profit 
Management guided that they are in progress 
There are two more projects that CITS is working on but the timeline is not 
certain: 1) to take over the duty-free business of the airports in Shanghai, and 
2) to open a downtown duty-free store in Beijing.   
As those two projects are policy driven, it is difficult to analyze the timing in 
executing these projects. However, we believe they could be the catalysts for 
the share price in the medium term. We have performed a sensitivity analysis 
on the earnings and risk-reward here.  
Conclusion: we believe the duty-free business in Shanghai airports and the 
downtown duty-free store in Beijing are likely to contribute c.RMB1.2bn net 
profit to CITS (note that our 2018E earnings forecast for CITS is RMB3.4bn) 
Catalyst No. 1 – Shanghai HQ/PD airport 
Sunrise’s duty-free operation license is expected to expire in 2018. Therefore, 
the market has been expecting CITS to take over the operation rights in two 
airports in Shanghai. We believe winning BCIA is a milestone for CITS and 
taking over from Sunrise in Shanghai could follow the same process.  
 
Shanghai Airport (Pudong + Hongqiao) currently enjoys annual 
International traffic of c.40 million (35 million in Pudong and 5 million 
in Hongqiao).  
 
Although there is no public data for Sunrise’s (the current duty-free 
operator) sales numbers for the existing Shanghai Hongqiao, we 
estimate that duty-free stores in Shanghai airport are likely to generate 
c.RMB7-8bn duty-free sales, higher than BCIA.  
 
If we assign a 7-8% net margin to the business, CITS is likely to 
generate another RMB490-640m net profit. 
Catalyst No. 2 – Downtown Duty-Free in Beijing 
The competitive advantage of downtown duty-free is that 1) length of stay is 
much longer than for duty-free in the airports, 2) the ticket price is higher, and 
3) CITS doesn’t have to pay concessionaire to the airports.  
Located in Beijing’s Central Business District, the downtown duty-free store in 
Beijing is currently only open to foreigners (including people from Hong Kong, 
Macau and Taiwan). 
Due to such restrictions, the current traffic volume is quite small. However, 
management disclosed that the company is actively applying for permission 
from the Ministry of Finance to extend the purchase qualification to domestic 
citizens who go abroad.  
Earnings upside potential from downtown duty-free 
If the downtown duty-free is approved by the Chinese government, we believe 
it could contribute an additional c.RMB600m net profit to CITS, on top of our 
current estimate.

 
No need to pay concessionaire fee to BCIA – customers can get their 
duty-free products in airports, but CITS doesn’t have to pay 40%+ 
concessionaire sales to BCIA if the purchase happens in the 
downtown duty-free store.  
 
Higher ticket price – customers tend to shop more in the downtown 
DFS than the airport DFS, mainly due to the better shopping 
environment and more diversified brands and commodities. Taking 
Haitang Bay as an example, consumption per person was c.RMB4,700 
in 2016. Per person purchases in BCIA are less than RMB1,000. 
Sensitivity analysis on earnings potential upside 
We have performed a sensitivity analysis on how much upside downtown 
duty-free can contribute to our 2018 earnings estimate.  
 
Net margin – we assign a 15% net margin gap between Downtown 
and Airport DFS, due to their rent cost difference.  
 
Portion of international traffic – we assign 25% as the portion of total 
international traffic that will likely shop in Downtown DFS. Note that 
the international traffic of BCIA was 25 million in 2016, we assume a 
25% duty-free conversion rate. 
 
Ticket price – we conservatively assume consumption per visit in 
Downtown DFS will be RMB2,000 (vs. c.4,700 in Haitang Bay in 2016). 
 
As a result, we estimate additional earnings could be c.RMB600m, 
which accounts for c. 17% of our 2018E CITS earnings.

Valuation – target price of RMB55 
Lifting our TP to RMB55 from RMB40 before 
We believe CITS’s valuation is very attractive at 24x our 2018 earnings 
forecast, as the duty-free business is protected and enjoys barriers to entry in 
China.  
Our TP of RMB55 implies a forward PER of 24x on our 2018 earnings 
forecasts. We derive our TP based on DCF (8.1% WACC, 9% cost of equity, 
beta of 0.9 and 3.0% TGR, unchanged). 
 
WACC of 8.1%, unchanged 
 
Target of 80% equity for its capital structure 
 
A risk-free rate of 3.9% and market risk premium of 5.6% (our in-
house estimates)

Risk-reward seems attractive  
We believe the risk-reward profile is attractive. Our target price implies 35% 
upside potential.  
 
Bull case: If we factor in the two catalysts in our DCF model, the 
upside could be as high as 62%.  
 
Bear case: If we lower our revenue growth to zero from year 2020 in 
our DCF model, the target price would be RMB36, implying the 
downside risk to its close is 14%.

The information and opinions in this report were prepared by Deutsche Bank AG or one of its affiliates (collectively 
"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources 
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor 
is responsible for the accuracy or security controls of these websites. 
If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. 
Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes investment 
banking, trading and principal trading revenues. 
 
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
