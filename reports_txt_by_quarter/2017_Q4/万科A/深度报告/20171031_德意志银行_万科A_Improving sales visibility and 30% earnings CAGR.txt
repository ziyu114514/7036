We upgrade Vanke A to Buy from Hold and raise our TP by 22% to RMB31.21 
after factoring its strong 3Q17 results and latest land acquisitions. We believe 
Vanke can sustain its double-digit sales growth given its proactive landbanking 
and the potential JV with SZ Metro on the two Shenzhen projects. We forecast 
Vanke to report 30% earnings CAGR with post-tax gross margin expanding to 
24-25% in FY17-19F. Also, we expect the privatization of GLP to be completed 
by April 2018, which should be a positive share price catalyst. The stock now 
trades at 8.4x FY18F P/E and 21% discount to NAV, which is undemanding 
versus peers given its high earnings visibility. 
Proactive landbanking and JV with SZ Metro to sustain double-digit growth 
Vanke has acquired 19.0mn sqm in 3Q17 (including the asset package from 
GD International Trust), which is 22% more than its landbanking in 1H17. We 
estimate these projects could add ~RMB380bn of saleable resource with ~25% 
pre-tax gross margin on average (assuming no ASP increase). Also, Vanke is 
bidding for the two Shenzhen projects (1.8mn sqm GFA) auctioned by SZ 
Metro (Vanke’s largest shareholder). We believe Vanke will likely win the 
auction and the gross margin would be >50%, if the auction price is similar to 
the offer price that SZ Metro planned for exchange of Vanke’s shares before. 
Together with the other 40 above-metro JV projects with SZ Metro under good 
discussion, we believe Vanke can sustain double-digit sales growth in 2018F. 
Strong full-year results and GLP deal as positive catalysts 
We expect Vanke to report 30% earnings growth this year with post-tax gross 
margin expanding to ~24% (vs. 20.3% in FY16), given there are RMB432bn 
unbooked sales by September. Also, the privatization of GLP is expected to be 
completed before April 2018, which should provide synergy to Vanke’s existing 
logistics property business as its long-term earnings driver. We believe these 
two should be positive near-term catalysts for the share price. 
Strong 9M17 results with margin expansion 
Vanke reported strong 9M17 results with: 1) revenue staying flat at 
RMB117bn; 2) post-tax gross margin expanding to 23.7% (vs. 20.3% in FY16); 
3) core profits increasing 31% to RMB10.6bn; and 4) net gearing ratio 
increasing to 38% (vs. 26% in FY16 and 20% in 1H17). 
Valuation and risks 
Our TP is based on a 10% discount to end-2018F NAV of RMB34.68. The stock 
now trades at 8.4x FY18F P/E and at a 21% NAV discount. Key risks: 1) 
Baoneng selling its shares in the secondary market, 2) slower property sales, 
and 3) failure to acquire quality sites.

Investment Thesis 
Outlook 
We upgrade Vanke A to Buy from Hold. We believe Vanke can sustain its 
double-digit sales growth given its proactive landbanking and the potential JV 
with SZ Metro on the two Shenzhen projects. We forecast Vanke to report 30% 
earnings CAGR with post-tax gross margin expanding to 24-25% in FY17-19F. 
Also, we expect the privatization of Global Logistic Properties (GLP) to be 
completed by April 2018, which should be a positive share price catalyst.  
Valuation 
Our end-FY18F NAV estimate comprises of RMB21.14/share of development 
properties, RMB2.31/share of investment properties and RMB11.23/share of 
net cash. Our NAV estimate values existing landbank and properties based on 
a sum-of-the-parts methodology: 1) we use DCF to value the company's 
development properties, with a WACC of 9.1% (we apply a risk-free rate of 
3.0%, beta of 1.5, risk premium of 6.0% and cost of debt at 5.7%); and 2) we 
use a cap-rate approach (cap rate between 5% and 9%) to value investment 
properties. In our model, we assume full prepayment of the land appreciation 
tax. In terms of property price assumptions, we assume prices will grow 5% in 
T1/T2/T3 cities in 2018F and remain flat thereafter. 
Our 12-month target price is based on a discount to our NAV estimate. The 
rationale for such a target discount is based on eight key measures of the 
companies we cover (product quality, landbank quality, scale, leverage, growth 
prospect, profitability, financing advantage, and execution). Comparing China 
Vanke to peers in terms of operating and financial performance, we apply a 
10% discount to our NAV estimate. The benchmark index for the stock is MSCI 
China. 
Risks 
Macro risks: The government’s property tightening measures might be stricter 
than expected, which could result in volatile moves in housing transaction 
volumes, housing prices, land prices, and financing available to developers and 
homebuyers. The unexpected economic fluctuations in the Chinese economy 
also add risks to the sector. In addition, potential RMB depreciation may result 
in FX losses for developers with offshore financing. 
Company-specific risks: 1) Baoneng to sell its shares in the secondary market; 
2) property sales slow down significantly in the second half of 2017; and 3) 
failure to acquire quality sites, and therefore, inability to sustain its growth.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
