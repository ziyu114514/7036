3Q17 proﬁt beat; valuation already rich
with growth slowdown expected
3x proﬁt surge due to low-base amid heavy truck demand recovery
Weichai reported a 3.2x YoY surge in 3Q17 net proﬁt (under PRC GAAP) to
RMB2.0bn. Gross revenue grew by 89.4% YoY in 3Q17 to RMB39.2bn, on the
back of 1.2x and 80.6% YoY growth in heavy-duty truck (HDT) sales and engine
sales, respectively. However, 3Q17 gross proﬁt margin contracted by 1.4ppt YoY,
probably due to product mix deterioration with fewer engine sales, which carry
a higher margin than HDTs, in our view. Together with a 4.2ppt drop in SG&A
ratio to 13.1%, oﬀset by a 48.3% YoY decline in investment income and a 66.4%
increase in ﬁnance cost, 3Q17 net proﬁt margin enhanced by 2.7ppt YoY to 5.0%.
On a 9M17 basis, Weichai's unaudited reported net proﬁt (under PRC GAAP) grew
2.0x YoY to RMB4.6bn.
Deutsche Bank view – earnings growth priced in with uncertain FY18 outlook
Weichai guided FY17 net proﬁt of RMB6.1-6.5bn, up 150-166% YoY. The mid-
point of the guidance implies a 4Q17 net proﬁt of RMB1.7bn (+88% YoY).
Therefore, we see upside risk to our full year forecast. However, in view of growth
slowdown and uncertainty in FY18E, we maintain our 12-month Sell rating on
Weichai-H, as we believe the stock looks demanding at 20x FY18E P/E, compared
with its historical average P/E of 11x. In addition, with a valuation premium over
H shares, we retain Weichai A shares as a Sell. Key upside risks include stronger-
than-expected HDT sales and higher-than-expected margins.

or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.
Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. Analysts are
paid in part based on the proﬁtability of Deutsche Bank AG and its aﬃliates, which includes investment banking, trading

not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report

situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments

judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
