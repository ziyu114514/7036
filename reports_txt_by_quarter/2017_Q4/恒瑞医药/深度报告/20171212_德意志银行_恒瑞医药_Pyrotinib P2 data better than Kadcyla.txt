Pyrotinib P2 data better than Kadcyla
Pyrotinib data much better than T-DM1 and lapatinib
The PFS beneﬁt (HR=0.374) surprised us despite previous qualitative comments
from Hengrui management. We believe it is highly likely Pyrotinib would be the
golden standard in 2L Herceptin relapsed HER2 positive BC in China. To us,
this is the second meaningful oncology clinical study from China ever, as trial
design followed a reasonable treatment paradigm that is NOT full of Chinese
characteristics. After data release at SABCS, we have higher conviction that
pyrotinib will be approved by CFDA based on P2 data.
We highlight our views in the following
■
Among trastuzumab relapsed patients, HR was 0.374 while mPFS has
not been reached in PC arm, vs. 7.1m in LC arm. The baseline PFS data
seemed to be in line with historic data (6.4m from EMILIA, 7m from S Gori
2016). The yet-to-be-reached mPFS should be more than 21m, according
to the data release.
■
EMILIA study showed a PFS beneﬁt of 9.6m for T-DM1 vs. 6.4m for LC,
with a HR of 0.65. Our surprise came from a gap of 21m vs. 9.6m. If these
data could be repeated in a P3 study, pyrotinib would become a golden
standard in 2L BC.
■
Previous studies indicated that TTP (from 1L Herceptin treatment) could
be a predictive marker for PFS/OS beneﬁt second-line HER2 inhibitors.
In this study, prior treatment of trastuzumab is associated with a longer
mPFS (7.1m vs. 5.6m for trastuzumab naive) for LC arms; data were also
consistent in PC arms. In our view, this should raise a serious question
for Chinese regulators regarding the relevance of clinical data from those
studies, speciﬁcally designed for Chinese patients today, who did not
follow NCCN treatment guidelines.
■
The additional questions include whether pyrotinib could be used in
1L BC, or adjuvant setting, or used oﬀ-label in GC. For the ﬁrst two
questions, we believe further data are required. That being said, for GC
setting, despite the failure of T-DM1 (GATSBY study, 2L GC) and lapatinib
(EGF110656, 1L GC), we gained reasonable conﬁdence that pyrotinib
might work based on impressive P2 data.

Overview of phase 2 study
As of December 2017, 128 patients were enrolled in the HER2+ metastatic
breast cancer, under open-label, randomized, parallel assignment setting. Dosing
regimen in treatment arm is pyrotinib (400 mg QD) plus capecitabine (1,000 mg/
sqm BID), while control arm is lapatinib (1,250mg QD) plue capecitabine (1,000
mg/sqm BID). The study were conducted among second line and beyond patients,
also excluded patients previously treated with lapatinib, neratinib, or other HER2+
TKIs. Primary endpoint was ORR, with PFS, time to progression (TTP), DoR and
OR as secondary points.
In addition, pyrotinib is under development for NSCLC and gastric cancer, which
are currently in phase 2 and 1 stage respectively. We reiterate our peak sales
estimate of RMB 2-2.8bn for the compound, on the back of Hengrui's established
oncology franchise and solid academic promotion eﬀorts.
We summarize the key clinical data in the following ﬁgures.

Notably, among patients without prior Herceptin treatment, the mPFS from PC
were 18.1 months, compared with 5.6 months for the LC group. The beneﬁts
can also be reaped for patients with previous exposure to Herceptin treatment.
The study suggest that pyrotinib exhibited PFS extension in PC arm, vs. LC arm
irrespective of prior trastuzumab treatments.
Primary endpoint ORR, registered at 78.5% in PC group, vs. 57.1% from control
group, with P-value of 0.01. For the higher response rates exhibited from control
arm vs. previous studies, we attribute this to investigator's assessment. To be
fair, the higher baseline ORR also represented a barrier for treatment arm to
demonstrate a statistically signiﬁcant beneﬁt.
Summary of grade 3/4 adverse events
As for the safety proﬁle comparison, most common grade 3/4 AEs including hand-
foot syndrome/ diarrhea/ neutrophil count decrease, with 24.6%, 15.4%, 9.2%
registered in PC group; vs. 20.6%, 4.8%, 3.2%, respectively, in LC group. Other
severe AEs include decreased appetite and multi-organ failure displayer similar
proﬁle compared with lapatinib-treated group. Overall, P2 trial suggests pyrotinib
is well tolerated among HER2+ mBC patients, either as single drug or in combo
with capecitabine, under MTD of 400mg QD.

Comparison of pyrotinib with previously approved compounds
In comparison with the approved therapies, we highlight that Herceptin
(trastuzumab) from Roche and Perjeta (pertuzumab) are the only compounds
approved for ﬁrst line therapy of HER2+ mBC, according to the latest NCCN
guidelines. The former was also approved in China, while the latter is currently
conducting phase 3 clinical study in China, with targeted enrollment of 240
patients. Notably, SBP is the only domestic company that ﬁled IND application
for the drug.
Kadcyla (T-DM1) and Tykerb (lapatinib) are the currently approved drugs for 2L
HER2 mBC treatments. T-DM1 is another blockbuster developed by Roche, which
achieved mPFS of 9.6m, vs. 6.4m compared to LC group. ORR were 43.6% vs.
30.8% for treatment and control arms. As for lapatinib from Novartis, it is an
aromatase inhibitor approved in 2007 by FDA for 2L treatment of HER2+ mBC, in
combo with capecitabine. It recorded robust eﬃcacy results supported by mOS
of 75 weeks, vs. 65.9 weeks from control arm. In addition, FDA also approved a
pan-HER TKI neratinib, indicated for extended adjuvant treatment of BC, among
early-stage HER2+ patients.
We compare the clinical trials of 2L HER2+ mBC compounds vs. pyrotinib in the
following table. We removed trastuzumab and neratinib from comparison due to
diﬀerent indication and line of therapy.

or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Trade ideas
for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction belief by an
analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of no less than
two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients,
and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the
majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does
not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an
oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
