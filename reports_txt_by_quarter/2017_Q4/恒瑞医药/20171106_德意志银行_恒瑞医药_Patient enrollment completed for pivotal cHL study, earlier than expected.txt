Patient enrollment completed for
pivotal cHL study, earlier than expected
Take-aways from dbAccess China Healthcare Corporate Day
We hosted Hengrui on Friday. The most important take-away is that LPI
(last patient in) might have occurred already, by our estimate. If we were to
conservatively assume response within 3-6 months after treatment, the ongoing
pivotal study would likely to be completed by 1Q18, and regulatory ﬁling could
occur as early as 2Q/3Q18, slightly ahead of street expectation. Other key take-
aways include the following:
■
The company believes its PD1 has a balanced eﬃcacy and AE proﬁle,
which is not much diﬀerent from marketed compounds. In addition,
Hengrui is very well positioned for future combo therapy as it has
the largest oncology drug oﬀerings. We believe this would be a key
diﬀerentiating element in its PD1 program, which will lead to commercial
success of the drug.
■
We estimate that Hengrui's PD-L1 has largely completed doses escalating
in the ongoing Australia P1 study.
■
IDO IND approval is expected in the near term.
■
Hengrui believes diﬀerent disease etiologies between Chinese and US
patients are likely to contribute to diﬀerent response rates. In addition to
lower response rates in melanoma and NSCLC, diﬀerent ORR might be
observed in liver, esophageal and gastric cancers.
■
Out of 4 ongoing P1 US studies, pyrotinib in NSCLC with HER2 mutations
is likely to be the priority as risk-reward appears appealing. We believe
if meaningful POC data were to be obtained, fast track and orphan drug
status would be likely.
■
SHR3162, a PARP inhibitor, will enter a P2 study in ovarian cancer soon,
according to the company. The study may enroll patients who received
1/2/3 previous lines of therapy, not just 2L and above.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
