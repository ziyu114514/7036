Driven by EV hype; other prospects also
improving
Outlook also better for EV batteries, conventional cars, monorail, etc
We think BYD's share price rally is mainly driven by recent government and OEM
vows to hasten new energy vehicle (NEV) development. However, we also see
earnings upside in future years from areas such as electric vehicle (EV) battery
sales to third parties, renewed designs for its car portfolio, more monorail projects,
additional handset materials, an increase in solar module demand and residential
power storage demand. These income streams should lead to a 37% FY17-19E
two-year EPS CAGR, supporting more upside to the share price.
NEV sector re-rating on sales pick-up and more positive news
Year-to-August, China sold 320k units of NEVs, up 30% YoY. With the continuous
roll-out of more local government subsidy policies and more NEV models
available, the negative impact of subsidy reduction on sales volume has abated.
Together with China's latest vow to ban sales of pure conventional fuel vehicles in
the long run and global/local OEMs' recent announcements of more R&D eﬀorts
in NEVs, we remain optimistic that we could see a 33% China NEV sales volume
ﬁve-year CAGR in 2015-20E. BYD should beneﬁt with its ~20% market share,
even if this is dropping amid competition. What is more, BYD is also considering
supplying EV batteries to third parties, with the ﬁrst contract possibly being signed
by yearend, according to the company.
Upside also for conventional cars, monorail, handset, solar and power storage

BYD has launched the new Song Max MPV with the new "Dragon Face" design.
We think the new design philosophy will enhance its future models' appearance,
and thus demand. The company has also unveiled its ﬁrst commercial monorail
system in Yinchuan, with expectations of another 20 project rollouts in FY18.
While we are still uncertain about this business's proﬁtability, we think the market
will start to give a valuation when more revenue is realized in FY18E. Meanwhile,
we also see more handset component revenue with the addition of 3D glass
material. For the solar module business, we foresee sales improvement driven by
overseas orders such as the recent 170MW orders from the US's NextEra (NEE.N,
USD146.55, Hold). Lastly, we see additional lithium ion battery sales potential via
the B-Box energy storage system.
Earnings upgrades on multiple revenue drivers; higher implied target P/E
Key downside risks: weak car sales, a slow
margin recovery in the battery and handset
component businesses, and more equity
fund raising. Key upside risks: rapid auto
sales and margin improvement, and better
sales and/or a margin recovery in the battery
and handset component businesses.
We raise our FY17-19E revenue and earnings on a better sales outlook for various
businesses. Our SOTP-derived target prices imply a target FY18E P/E of 28.1x,
which we believe is justiﬁed by BYD's exposure to China's NEV market.

China NEV – A structural
growth story
Sector outperformance alongside NEV sales pick-up
Year-to-date, Hong Kong and China listed NEV thematic stocks under our
coverage have rallied 37% on average (vs. HSCEI's 16% and CSI300's 16%). We
think this is well supported by a 30.2% YoY increase in NEV sales to 320k units in
8M17. To elaborate, passenger NEV sales volume rose 45.5% thanks to a wider
spectrum of NEV models oﬀered by various brands, in our view. Meanwhile, we
think that with the settling down of central and local government EV subsidy
schemes, including the subsidy level cuts spearheaded by the central government
in early 2017, commercial NEV YoY sales growth momentum has recovered from
minus 33.8% in 1H17 to positive 57.6% in July-August. Considering the sequential
improvement in sales, we remain conﬁdent that China should register 28% growth
in 2017E NEV sales volume to about 650k units.

Government and OEMs becoming more committed to
grooming the NEV market
Besides the physical sales improvement, we think that market sentiment on the
sector has also been boosted by the recent comments of government oﬃcials
and OEMs. To begin with, Mr. XIN Guobin, Vice Minister of China's Ministry of
Industries and Information Technology (MIIT), said in an industry forum in early
September that China is considering a ban on the sale of fossil fuel vehicles in
future. This echoes similar plans disclosed by the United Kingdom and France for
2040. While we do not think that a full ban will happen any time soon in China, we
view the aforementioned initiatives, together with the current subsidies, as proof
of the Chinese government's determination to drive NEV usage going forward.
In response to various countries' increasing push on NEV adoption, we also
observe that NEV R&D was amongst the most talked about subjects at the most
recent Frankfurt Auto Show. In brief, global OEMs plan to further their eﬀorts
in NEV development, with more products to be rolled out by the end of this
decade. What is more, many of these OEMs also have plans to localize their NEV
production in China, with the setting up of JVs.

BYD stands to beneﬁt in multiple ways
NEV sales to pick up with new models and electric bus orders
In 8M17, BYD remains one of the leaders in China NEV sales with a 19% market
share (2016: 22%), despite a YoY drop in sales. Excluding JV sales, BYD sold
27,344 units of passenger EVs in 8M17 (up 14.0% YoY) but it sold just 29,766 units
of passenger plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV, down 25.5% YoY) and 5,100 units
of commercial EVs (down 6.4% YoY). We attribute the slowdown to 1) reduced
government subsidies on PHEVs, 2) a lack of lower-price/lower-range passenger
EV models (a popular segment) vs. peers and 3) the policy uncertainty over electric
buses at the beginning of the year.

While we do not think that BYD possesses much NEV product advantage vs.
peers, we still believe that the company can sustain a high-teens market share. To
elaborate, its recently launched new passenger NEV models (i.e. Qin 100 PHEV,
Song PHEV and Song EV) have been selling well and BYD still plans to roll out
more lower-priced passenger EV/PHEVs in FY18.
For commercial EVs, we expect BYD's electric bus monthly sales to further ramp
up for the rest of the year with the recent announcement of more public bus
orders in Shenzhen. We still retain our FY17 sales forecast of 15k units despite
a cold start this year. In the medium term, we think commercial EV demand for
BYD will continue to rise with 1) more cities (e.g. Guangzhou) electrifying their
public bus ﬂeet (probably by 2020E, according to BYD) and 2) the rising adoption
of electric trucks in the area of sanitary trucks, concrete mixers and dump trucks.
EV battery sales to become a new income stream
On previous public occasions, BYD has reiterated that it is considering supplying
EV batteries to third party OEMs besides in-house consumption. According to the
company, there are ongoing discussions with outside OEMs and it is possible that
some supply contracts could be signed by yearend.
According to BYD, its EV battery consumption should be about 10GWh this year
vs. its existing EV battery production capacity of 13GWh. In the foreseeable
future, the company's new Qinghai battery plant will add 10GWh new capacity
(with 5GWh in phase one) in 2018 and the new facility will produce the more
advanced nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC) batteries. As such, we think that BYD
will have the capability to sell both lithium iron phosphate (LFP) and NMC batteries
to third parties and we estimate that it probably has room to sell 4GWh of EV
batteries in FY18, representing a meaningful new income stream.
Last but not least, as the Chinese government has recently conﬁrmed that it is
considering less stringent requirements for foreign NEV entities to localize their
NEV production in China, we may see increased participation of foreign OEMs

BYD
and thus potentially higher demand for local brand EV batteries, an area that is
still well protected by the government.
NEV credit sales still a remote income source, probably starting 2020E
On 28 September, the Chinese government released the ﬁnalized version of
“Parallel Administrative Measures for Passenger Vehicle Corporate Average Fuel
Consumption (CAFC) and New Energy Vehicle (NEV) Credits”, which is also
commonly known as the dual credit scheme. The document requires automakers
to generate NEV credit points equivalent to 10% of sales by 2019 and 12% by
2020, by selling a certain number of EVs (about 2-5 points each, depending
on range and battery eﬃciency) and PHEVs (2 points each). The NEV credit
percentage requirement is applicable to traditional PV OEMs with more than
30k units of annual production or import volume in China. Those who fail to get
suﬃcient credits (i.e. by selling enough NEVs or buying credits from other OEMs
like BYD) will be suspended from producing or importing vehicles that cannot
meet the fuel eﬃciency requirement.
To obtain credit points equal to 10%/12% of vehicles sold in 2019/2020, we
estimate that an OEM probably would need to achieve roughly 2.0-5.0%/2.5-6.0%
NEV sales (as a % of total sales volume), depending on the NEV mix and NEV
advanced level. While it may not be easy for traditional OEMs with a late start in
NEV rollout to achieve enough credits in 2019, in our view, the government does
allow them to use credits gained in 2020 to compensate. Therefore, we think that
the credit trading market is unlikely to become active until 2020 for BYD to beneﬁt.

Ex-NEV: optimistic about
growth prospects
Possible conventional car business recovery with new
design
BYD has just launched a new MPV model named Song Max, with a price range
of RMB79.9-119.9k. Although the MPV segment is still small in China, with a
demand decline this year, the signiﬁcance of this BYD model is that it showcases
the company's latest design language. Indeed, the car's design was led by
Mr. Wolfgang Egger, the ex-Head Designer of Audi (NSUG.DE, EUR707.75, Not
Rated), while the chassis tuning was led by Mr. Heinz Keck, who joined from
Daimler (DAIGn.DE, EUR67.47, Buy). We think that this revised design philosophy
will be adopted in future BYD models and an enhanced product image can
probably help the company to improve its conventional car sales as well.

More monorail projects to be realized in 2018E onward
According to BYD, the company has spent about RMB5bn of R&D on its monorail
business, known as SkyRail, in the past ﬁve years. In early September, BYD
unveiled its ﬁrst commercial monorail line in Yinchuan in Ningxia Province. It is
a short 5.7km system in Yinchuan's Flower Expo Park. For FY17E, BYD expects
to book about RMB5bn of revenue from the monorail business with about 40km
completion, mostly in a public-private partnership (PPP) format with BYD as one
of the investors. In FY18E, BYD plans to begin construction of another 20 projects
(e.g. in Shantou and Guilin), with more cities under negotiation.
While we are still uncertain about the monorail business's proﬁtability, BYD
once claimed that it could be more proﬁtable than the NEV business given less
competition, and we now think that investors will probably be willing to apply
some valuation to this business once more revenue is booked in FY18E.

Handset business still in good shape
BYD has experienced solid growth in its handset-related business, thanks to
consistently strong orders from major local brand clients such as Vivo and Xiaomi.
The company also see business growth from its 3D Glass business (similar to the
growth driven by metal casing popularization, in our view).
Solar and electrical energy storage business picking up
According to BYD, its solar module business was loss-making in 1H17. While we
do not envision a meaningful recovery in the near term, we think the trend will
improve (as suggested by the company). For instance, BYD will supply 170MW
solar modules to NextEra Energy for power plants projects in the US. This is the
biggest order the company has got so far in North America, a region to which
BYD has shipped about 1GW of solar modules to date.
Besides, BYD introduced its B-Box electrical energy storage system in Europe
and Australia earlier this year to store the electricity generated by rooftop solar
systems. The ﬁrst installation, a 11.5kWh storage system, was just completed in
Germany and BYD plans to introduce the system in the US market as well. While
we do not expect the demand for B-Box to suddenly surge in future, it can provide
another channel for the company to utilize its lithium ion battery capacity.

Valuation and risks
Earnings upgrades on better revenue outlook
Mainly on the back of higher pricing forecasts for BYD's NEV business, despite
lower volume forecasts for aggregate vehicle sales, and higher revenue estimates
for the monorail business, we raise BYD's FY17-19E revenue by 9.1-16.1% and
net proﬁt by 11.1-19.8%.

Valuation not stretched given rapid earnings rebound
Our SOTP-derived target prices are based on 1) a peer average FY18E P/E of 14.7x,
24.0x and 7.2x for the handset business (16% of SOTP value), battery business
(7% of SOTP value) and monorail business (2% of SOTP value), respectively; and 2)
a peer average FY18E P/sales of 1.4x and 2.2x for the conventional auto business
(10% of SOTP value) and the NEV business (65% of SOTP value), respectively
(vs. the previous P/E-to-growth methodology used for the auto business), since
we think the market cares more about BYD's NEV sales momentum rather than
immediate proﬁtability. The implied target FY18E P/E is 28.1x, the highest target
P/E benchmark among its local peers, which we believe is justiﬁed by its unique
exposure to China's NEV market and its 37% FY17-19E two-year EPS CAGR. We
maintain Buy on BYD-H on a positive earnings outlook, driven by a NEV sales
recovery, as well as potential EV battery sales to third parties. We maintain Hold
on BYD-A, given the valuation premium to the H-shares.

or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.
Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. Analysts are

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no
less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to time discuss with
our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report
is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
