3Q17 proﬁt as guided; 4Q17E earnings
to improve slightly QoQ
4Q guidance below expectation but new energy vehicle (NEV) sales still
growing
BYD has reported 3Q17 results under PRC GAAP. Gross revenue grew by 3.8% YoY
to RMB28.9bn on higher demand for its own brand passenger and commercial
new energy vehicles (up 9.7% and 7.5% YoY, respectively), partially oﬀset by a
36.4% YoY decline in conventional vehicle sales during the period. Gross proﬁt
margin declined by 2.3 ppt YoY probably on lower NEV margin after subsidy cut,
in our view. Meanwhile, BYD’s 3Q17 net proﬁt declined 23.9% YoY to RMB1.1bn,
which is near the mid-range of BYD’s previous guidance.
In its announcement, BYD guided that it expects to register a 15.1-20.0% YoY
decline in FY17 net proﬁt to RMB4.04-4.29bn, which translates to 4Q17E net proﬁt
of RMB1.2-1.5bn (vs. RMB1.4bn in 4Q16), implying an YoY decline of up to 10.0%
or an YoY growth of up to 8.0%. For 4Q17, BYD expects NEV sales to continue to
grow at a high pace, while traditional passenger vehicle sales can improve with
good market reception for the new Song Max MPV. Besides, management sees
positive outlook for its handset component and assembly business, and more
revenue/proﬁt recognition for its monorail projects.
Deutsche Bank view - Buy BYD-H as scalable Chinese NEV play
BYD’s FY17E earnings guidance accounts for about 91-96% of our forecast.
Considering the guidance, we trim our FY17-19E revenue by 0.8-3.6% on 1) more
prudent vehicle sales forecast and 2) a possible cut in subsidy income amount
in FY18 amid policy reﬁnement. We also cut our FY17-19 net proﬁt forecasts by
6.9-11.8% on lower margin assumptions for the auto business.
Our SOTP-derived target prices are based on 1) a peer average FY18E P/E of 15.5x,
22.4x and 7.4x for the handset business (18% of SOTP value), battery business
(6% of SOTP value) and monorail business (2% of SOTP value), respectively; and 2)
a peer average FY18E P/sales of 1.7x and 2.1x for the conventional auto business
(12% of SOTP value) and the NEV business (62% of SOTP value), respectively.
The implied target FY18E P/E is 29.8x, the highest target P/E benchmark among
its local peers, which we believe is justiﬁed by its unique exposure to China's
NEV market and its 37% FY17-19E two-year EPS CAGR. We maintain Buy on
BYD-H on a positive earnings outlook, mainly driven by robust NEV demand
and potential NEV battery sales to third parties. We maintain Hold on BYD-A,
given the valuation premium to the H-shares. Key upside risks: rapid auto sales

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
