We reiterate our Buy rating on Hikvision and raise our target price to CNY43 
from CNY34.5, as we raise our earnings forecast and lift the target multiple to 
30x from 25x, driven by our expectation of accelerated earnings growth due to 
margin expansion. 
Better-than-expected margin expansion and outlook 
We have been highlighting Hikvision’s margin expansion through a rising 
solution business and management efforts. 3Q17 GPM of 46% is a high since 
2015, above DB/consensus expectations of 42%. As Hikvision continues to 
pursue solution business opportunities in overseas markets and its domestic 
market continues to improve, we expect the company to sustain the 2017 
margin expansion into 2018/2019 at 44%. 
AI strategy focuses on edge cloud computing 
Hikvision recently announced its “AI cloud” framework at the 16th public 
safety expo in Shenzhen. Its strategy focuses on edge cloud for video 
surveillance applications, which allows faster responses and the filtering of 
unnecessary data from video/images captured by millions of cameras 
constantly. In addition to domestic transportation and security projects, 
Hikvision has won a smart city project in Singapore of over USD10mn. The 
increasing adoption of AI presents upside risks to revenue and margins. 
Positive progress in the innovation business 
In addition to AI, the innovation business is a growth catalyst at Hikvision. The 
largest contributor is Ezviz, whose subscribers exceed 20mn. In addition to a 
consumer client base, it has business clients, such as retail chain and property 
management companies, which utilize the Ezviz cloud to track client traffic and 
monitor premises. Its robot business has landed orders for three types of 
robots for JD.com’s automated warehouse in Shanghai. We expect the 
innovation business to grow 142%/83% in 2017/2018. 
Valuation and risks 
Hikvision’s share price has appreciated over 150%+ YTD (vs. Shenzhen 
Composite index: 2%). We expect it to continue re-rating, given accelerated 
profit growth from AI exposure, rising innovation contributions, and margin 
improvement. Our new target price of CNY43 is based on 30x FY2018E PE, 
which lies toward the top end of the company’s historical trading range, and 
would be supported by an accelerated 34% profit CAGR in 2017-2019E, 
compared to a 26% profit CAGR in 2014-2016. Risks: market share loss, weak 
demand in industry project orders (see page 8-10, for details).

Earnings comparison 
3Q17 results beat our forecast in margin expansion 
Hikvision’s 3Q17 revenue is in line with our forecast with 31% YoY growth, 
due to continual market share gains. More importantly, it delivered a strong 
GPM of 46.3% (vs DBe’s 42.6%) in the quarter, a significant improvement from 
43% in 2Q17 and a record high since 2015. Management attributes the margin 
improvement to management efforts and the growth of the higher-margin 
solution business. With an opex ratio decline due to scale, 3Q17 operating 
profit was 14% ahead of DBe at CNY2.8bn, +55% QoQ and +32%YoY. Lower 
non-op income was offset by tax return with high-tech software qualification. 
3Q17 profit was 6% of DBe at CNY2.9bn, up 58% QoQ and 28% YoY, arriving 
at EPS of CNY0.31.

Business update 
New progress in industrial robots 
JD.com completed its first unmanned factory recently, where the robots for 
sorting, transporting and loading, and industrial version solutions are provided 
by Hikrobotics Technology, a subsidiary of Hikvision. At the sorting stage, 
Hikvision installed cameras on the robot’s arms to identify the bar code, size 
and shape of each package, enabling the robot’s arms to grab the packages 
more precisely. The packages are then passed onto sorting robots and 
delivered to different warehouse areas via address categorization. Hikvision 
provides the whole recognition system for these robots. Hikvison Group 
supplies the total solution, including the robot’s body, brain and eyes.  
Except for the e-commerce logistics area, Hikvision’s warehousing robots 
apply to most other industries, such as solar and manufacturing. At the 3Q17 
results analyst meeting, management indicated that lots of competitors are 
targeting the potentially enormous industrial robot market due to its low entry 
barriers. However, management is confident of its competitive advantage in 
high-end robots, given the company’s customization ability and its core skills 
in image recognition technology. 
Hikrobotics is part of Hikvision’s innovation business. Despite limited revenue 
contribution, it provides business opportunities that will come if JD.com builds 
more automated warehouses, upgrades existing facilities or if other e-
commerce companies follow suit. We believe industrial robots are a catalyst 
for Hikvision’s long-term growth, given the automation trend and government 
campaigns such as “Made in China 2025”.

Rising contribution of solutions and projects to overseas 
business 
Hikvision has been expanding its overseas business, given its lower market 
share outside of China. In 1H17, the overseas revenue contribution reached 
30%, with 38% YoY growth, due to share gains. The overseas business is able 
to generate a higher GPM (48%/50% in 2016/1H17) due to milder competition. 
Moreover, management targets to increase the contribution of projects and 
solutions to its overseas business as they generate better margins and are 
closer to end-demand. We believe management has devoted additional 
resources and set up more offices to target the solution/project business. Its 
contribution to overseas business increased to 30% in 1H17 from under 20% in 
2016. Management noted a recent order win for a smart city project in 
Singapore of over USD10mn, one of the largest AI smart city projects in South-
east Asia.  
Given lower market share and management efforts to expand the overseas 
market, we expect the growth of the overseas business to outpace domestic 
growth with rising contributions in the coming years. The rising contribution of 
the overseas business with its rising project/solution exposure will be margin 
accretive to Hikvision’s overall margin profile.

CNY10bn investment plan paves the way for future growth  
In September, Hikvision’s board of directors decided to invest CNY10bn capex 
to build four R&D centers and two industrial bases in five cities in the next four 
years. The four R&D centers will cost CNY6.5bn and be deployed in the cities 
of Xi’an, Wuhan, Chengdu and Hangzhou. Combined with the Hangzhou R&D 
center, their R&D network will cover mid-western provinces in China and 
utilize local science and education talents to strengthen the R&D team. The 
two production bases will cost CNY4bn and be deployed in Chongqing and 
Wuhan. The completion of the production bases will help Hikvision leverage 
local labor resources and increase capacity. 
We expect these R&D centers to strengthen Hikvision’s core competence in 
video surveillance (smart city etc.) and develop innovation businesses (such as 
cloud, 
industry 
automation 
and 
automotive 
applications) 
with 
new 
applications, while the new production bases will increase capacity and 
vertical integration capability as the company grows in size. For the long-term 
outlook, we believe the investment plan is in sync with management’s strategy 
to secure its leadership in the video surveillance sector while diversifying into 
new growth segments.

Share reduction by major shareholder  
Major shareholder Hong-Jia Gong sold 107m shares for CNY3.1bn via a block 
trade on 27 September. Those shares accounted for 7.2% and 1.2% of his total 
holdings (16.2%) and outstanding shares, respectively. After the transaction, 
Mr Gong remains the second largest shareholder with 1.39bn shares, 
accounting for 15.01% of the total stock.  
Mr. Gong has started to offload his stock via block trades since 2013, when his 
stake was then 20%. Hikvision indicates that his share reduction plan is for 
personal cash demand purposes and is not related to the company’s 
business outlook.

Valuation and investment 
risks 
Maintaining a Buy rating with a 12-month target price of 
CNY43 
We use a P/E methodology to value Hikvision, as we expect the company to 
continue to generate earnings growth from its core video surveillance products 
with improving margins stemming from the rising solution business. Our target 
price of CNY43 is based on a 30x target P/E multiple for 2018E EPS, the 
average of the top two bands from the forward P/E band chart. We believe the 
company can reach this level, given accelerated earning growth with industry 
leadership, AI exposure, and a surge in the innovation business and margin 
improvement. We expect earnings growth to accelerate at a 34% profit CAGR 
in 2017-2019, up from a 26% profit CAGR in 2014-2016, while ROE expands 
from 34% in 2016 to 37% in 2018/2019E.

From the peer comparison table, we note that Hikvision is trading at a higher 
PE/PB multiple over its peers and we attribute the premium to its industry 
leadership and substantially higher ROE of > 30%, compared to the sector 
average of 20%/23%. In addition, we expect its earnings growth to accelerate 
into 2018 with continual share gains, AI exposure and margin improvement. 
We expect it to sustain the valuation premium on the basis of a higher-than-
sector average growth outlook and ROE delivery.

Risks 
 
Market share loss to video surveillance peers would adversely affect 
sales and EPS estimates. 
 
Weaker orders from system integrators, value-added retailers, 
governments, and corporate clients would lead to lower shipments 
and earnings than we expect. 
 
Higher component costs or labor cost hikes in China.

"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources 
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-

report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on.

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
