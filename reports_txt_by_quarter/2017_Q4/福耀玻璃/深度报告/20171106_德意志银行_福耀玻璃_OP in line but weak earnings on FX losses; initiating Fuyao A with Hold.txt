OP in line but weak earnings on FX
losses; initiating Fuyao A with Hold
OP numbers in line but FX losses
Fuyao released 3Q17 results after market close on Wednesday. NPAT slightly
decreased 1% YoY to RMB2.14bn in 9M17, representing only 67% and 66% of
DB's whole year estimate and Bloomberg consensus, respectively, mainly due to
FX losses of RMB300m+ in 9M17 as a result of RMB appreciation against the
USD. If we strip out FX losses, Fuyao’s bottom line actually increased 24% YoY
in 9M17, in line with our estimate (please refer to table below).
US auto glass turned proﬁtable in 3Q17; management optimistic about
international operations
According to management at the results call yesterday, the US auto glass plant
started to make a proﬁt in 3Q17 with earnings of USD1.6m+, vs over USD10m
of losses in 1H17. Management expects the momentum to continue as eﬃciency
improves. The second phase of the US project (capacity: 2.5m sets) is completed
as planned and management expects it to ramp up in Feb 2018. In addition,
management sees no signiﬁcant challenges in gaining market share in the US,
citing improving eﬃciency, customer satisfaction, and R&D abilities as the main
reasons.
Initiating on Fuyao-A with a Hold; risks
With this report, we initiate coverage of Fuyao A shares (600660.SS) with a Hold
and a target price of RMB23. The valuation is derived from the currency translation
of our H-share target price, which is set using DCF methodology, with a WACC of
7.1% (cost of equity at 8.4%, risk-free rate at 3.9%, market risk premium of 5.6%,
beta of 0.8) and terminal growth of 0%. The stock is trading at 21.6x 2017 DBe
EPS with 2017-19 DBe EPS CAGR of 12%. We believe the valuation is fair, and
thus initiate with a Hold. Fuyao A is trading at 21.6x 2017 DBe EPS with 2017-19
DBe EPS CAGR of 12%. A share peers are trading at 23x 2017E EPS and 2017-19
EPS CAGR of 17%. Also, Fuyao is an exclusive, leading auto glass player with 65%
market share in China and over 20% globally, and we believe it has competitve
edge. Risks: Fuyao may face challenges during its international expansion, such
as ﬂuctuations in currency exchange rates, political and economic instability, etc.
Also, automobile glass industry is competitive, thus there is pressure on Fuyao's
market share if it cannot compete eﬀectively. Other risks include: higher or lower
raw materials and fuel prices; changes to the incentives provided by the PRC
government could materially reduce Fuyao's proﬁtability, e.g. a change in the
preferential income tax rate.

Key takeaways from 9M17 earnings call
■
US factory capacity ramp-up: 3m sets capacity this year in the
US, output guidance of 2.1m-2.3m sets (about 70% utilization rate).
Management is optimistic about reaching this target. Construction of the
phase II project (2.5m sets capacity) is mostly complete; management
expects it to ramp up in Feb 2018.
■
Overseas profit: In 3Q17, US auto glass started to make a proﬁt with
earnings of USD1.6m+, and US ﬂoat glass proﬁt was about USD3.0m.
In 9M17, US auto glass generated a loss of USD8.7m and US ﬂoat glass
a proﬁt of USD7.5m. Management expects the strong momentum to
continue at the US plants, thanks to improving eﬃciency and customer
satisfaction. The Russia operation still suﬀered losses in 3Q17, but
management expects it to turn proﬁtable in 4Q, as volume is picking up.
■
FX exposure: Fuyao currently has around USD700m in cash and this
matches the needs of overseas operations; the USD deposit interest rate
is approximately equal to the company's USD debt interest rate.
■
ASP: Excluding the FX impact, ASP increased 3.5% YoY in the reporting
period, mainly thanks to high value-added products. This year, the
company expects high value-added products to account for about 33%
of total revenue, 3ppt higher than last year.
■
Production costs: Besides a signiﬁcant market price increase for soda
ash, the costs of logistics, packaging, etc all increased this year.
However, management is conﬁdent that it can deal with the pressure by
promoting strong cost-control measures.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
