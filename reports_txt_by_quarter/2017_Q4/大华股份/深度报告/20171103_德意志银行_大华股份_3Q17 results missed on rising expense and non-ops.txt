Dahua reported 3Q17 EPS of RMB0.16, which was 12% below the DB forecast 
of RMB0.18 on rising selling expenses and higher finance costs. We maintain 
our Buy rating and TP of CNY27.5. 
Higher selling expense and non-op loss impact on 3Q17 profit 
Dahua’s 3Q17 revenue and gross profits were in line with the DB forecast, but 
3Q17 operating profits were 9% below, at RMB359m, -49% QoQ/+72% YoY, 
mainly due to a higher selling expense ratio, at 15%. Moreover, the non-op 
profits were below our forecast, as the recurring income from the VAT tax 
return was offset by a surge in finance expense from forex losses. While 3Q17 
pre-tax income was 24% below the DB forecast, on rising expenses and lower 
non-op, Dahua incurred a tax credit of RMB28m, as with the RMB32m tax 
credit in 3Q16. 3Q17 net income was 12% below the DB forecast at CNY461m, 
-34% QoQ/+28% YoY, for EPS of CNY0.16. For 1-3Q17, net profit registered 
CNY1.4bn, within management guidance of CNY1.3-1.5bn 
2017 full-year guidance on profit growth at 20-40%  
Management gave 2017 full-year guidance of annual profit to grow 20-40% 
YoY, with the range of net profit at CNY2.2bn-2.6bn. We note that the new 
guidance is lower than the raised 25-45% guidance for 1-3Q17 profit growth 
given out in August 2017. The lower guidance could potentially be a reflection 
of the lower non-op income. As we enter the peak season in 4Q17, we expect 
revenue to grow 26% QoQ/59% YoY, while operating margin recovers from 
scale. Our 2017 full-year profit forecast of RMB2.5bn, for EPS of RMB0.87, is 
at the high-end of management’s guidance. 
Positive 2018 outlook with accelerated profit growth 
We expect the strong revenue growth momentum to sustain into 2018 as the 
company continues to expand market share with rising total solution projects. 
In addition, the AI applications and future PPP projects are catalysts to drive 
Dahua’s growth outlook. In particular, Dahua has indicated participation in 
Alibaba’s “City Brain” project in providing infrastructures such as front-end 
sensors, back-end storage and access platforms. We expect OPM to sustain at 
the 2017 level of 12%, with a rising solution contribution and increasing scale.  
Valuation and risks 
As the 3Q17 miss was mainly due to the rising selling expense and lower non-
op income, we lower our 2017 earnings by 7% but leave our 2018 forecast 
unchanged. We remain positive on Dahua and our TP is unchanged at 
CNY27.5, based on 22x FY2018E PE, supported by accelerated profit growth of 
38%/43% in 2017/2018 and ROE expansions. Risks: market share loss and 
weak orders from solution projects.

Downside risks 
 
Slower orders for video surveillance products and the solution 
business could result in downside risks for its revenue and earnings 
growth vs. our assumptions. 
 
Weaker ODM orders from globally-leading brand vendors would 
negatively impact sales and OPM performance. 
 
Higher costs for components, labor, and factory management in China.

believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. 
Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes investment

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
