3Q17 beat with encouraging yield and
int'l load factor recovery
48% proﬁt growth amid improvement in passenger yield
Spring reported 3Q17 gross revenue growth of 28.9% YoY to RMB3.6bn on the
back of 15.0% passenger traﬃc (RPK) YoY growth and passenger yield recovery,
in our opinion. Meanwhile, operating expenses increased at a slower pace of
27.0% YoY due mainly to an increase in capacity (ASK), higher fuel cost and
take-oﬀ/landing fees post CAAC price reform in April, according to the company.
Together with 1) 22bps drop in SG&A to revenue ratio; 2) ﬂattish net ﬁnance cost
and 3) limited investment loss (3Q16: RMB23.2m investment loss), the airline
recorded a 36.6% YoY increase in operating proﬁt to RMB696.9m. Helped by
RMB195.0m non-operating income (+22.6% YoY) mainly from local airports route
subsidies, the airline’s 3Q17 net proﬁt grew by 47.6% YoY to RMB633.9m. On
a 9M17 basis, Spring's unaudited reported net proﬁt increased by 1.6% YoY to
RMB1.2bn.
Deutsche Bank view – yield recovery on track; maintain Buy
As Spring’s 9M17 proﬁt accounted for 117% of our full-year earnings estimate and
107% of consensus, we consider the results beat our expectation. Even though
4Q is usually a slow season for Chinese airlines, we see upside risk to our full
year forecast, due to a decent yield trend and recovery in the international load
factor. In September, Spring recorded 10.3% YoY passenger traﬃc (RPK) growth,
driven by 18.2% YoY growth in domestic passenger traﬃc but 3.0% YoY decline
in international traﬃc. Passenger load factor improved 0.4ppt YoY to 89.6% in
September with international load factor recording YoY improvement (+2.9ppt to
85.2%) for the ﬁrst time since February.
We maintain Buy as we expect the airline’s yield to bottom in FY17 with the load
factor staying at c.92%. Our TP is based on 3.5x average FY18E P/BV, c.30%
below Spring’s average P/BV of 5.0x since listing. We believe this is justiﬁed
vs. sustainable ROE of about 15-16%. Key downside risks: excessive capacity
addition; competition from regional LCCs and Chinese airlines; and slower-than-
expected demand growth.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
