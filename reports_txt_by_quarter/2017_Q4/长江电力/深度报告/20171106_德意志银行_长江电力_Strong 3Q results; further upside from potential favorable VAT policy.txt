Strong 3Q results; further upside from
potential favorable VAT policy
Yangtze Power reported robust 3Q17 results with net proﬁt up by 11% to
Rmb9.7bn. As a result, 9M17 net proﬁt increased by 9% yoy to Rmb17.8bn,
accounting for 90% of our previous full-year forecast (historically 79-83%). The
3Q earnings growth are primarily driven by a 4% yoy increase in power output,
a 87% yoy increase in investment income and a 11%/19% yoy drop in ﬁnancial/
operational cost. Consequently, we lift FY17/18 earnings by 10/9% on the back
of strong 3Q results. With 15% upside to our new target price of Rmb18.3, we
reiterate Buy on Yangtze Power given 1) a high-quality hydro power assets with
stable earnings, 2) an absolute DPS commitment at Rmb0.65/sh until 2020 (4.0%
yield) and >75% payout post 2020, 3) potential earnings upside if the favorable
VAT rebate policy gets extended. Management will host a call at 9:00 am on 1
Nov (dial in: China: 95040123456; overseas: +86 5722760523).
3Q17 results boosted by higher output, investment income and cost savings
In 3Q17, net proﬁt was up by 11% yoy to Rmb9.7bn driven by 4% yoy increase in
net output, a 87% yoy increase in investment income and a 11%/19% yoy drop in
ﬁnancial/operational cost. Power generation growth recovered from a 4% decline
in the ﬁrst half to 4% yoy in 3Q17 thanks to improving water ﬂows in Three Gorges
(output +6% yoy) and Gezhouba (output +11% yoy). While Chuanyun (Xiluodu
and Xiangjiaba)’s power output growth remains stable with 1% improvement in
3Q17.
As a result, 9M17 net proﬁt was up 9% yoy to Rmb17.8bn. The 1% yoy decrease
in net power output was well oﬀset by 12%/24% yoy decrease in ﬁnancial/
operational cost and doubled investment income. 9M17 results accounts for 90%
of our previous full year estimates, ahead of the historical range of 79-83%.
Further room for ﬁnancial cost savings
In 9M17, Yangtze's ﬁnancial cost was lowered by 12% yoy to Rmb4.4bn with
stable net gearing at 110%. Eﬀective interest rate was lowered by 0.3ppt to 4.4%
per our calculation. During the 1H17 results conference call held in September,
mgmt expects the debt to asset ratio to decrease gradually from 59% to 30%, after
which Yangtze may consider M&A and raise the debt to asset ratio again. We see
further room for ﬁnancial cost savings going forward as a result of deleveraging.
Hydro VAT rebate could be extended, positive to Yangtze
According to Energy News on 8 Sep, the NDRC is soliciting feedbacks for the
notice of Reduce the Tax for Enterprises in Renewables Energy Sector. In the
notice, the NDRC proposes to reduce the VAT for hydro power units (with capacity

for those with capacity above 1GW. If passed, Yangtze Power would be the key
beneﬁciary and we estimate the extended VAT rebate would bring 9.6%/9.4%
2018/19E earnings upside. See report Hydro VAT rebate could be extended,

or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.
Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. Analysts are
paid in part based on the proﬁtability of Deutsche Bank AG and its aﬃliates, which includes investment banking, trading

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no
less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to time discuss with
our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report
is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
