Conference call takeaways
China Eastern Airlines (CEA) hosted a post-3Q17 results conference call on 27
October. Key takeaways are as follows:
■
Yield: CEA recorded ﬂattish passenger yield in 3Q17 with 0.3% domestic
yield YoY growth oﬀset by 0.6% international yield YoY decline (mainly
due to the aggressive launch of long-haul international routes in the past
few years).
■
Capacity: CEA guided for about 9% YoY passenger capacity (ASK)
expansion in 4Q17, comprising 7% domestic ASK growth and 13%
international ASK growth. For FY18, the airline expects its ASK to
grow c.10% YoY with 8% YoY on domestic routes and 10-12% YoY
on international routes. Considering the regulator's (CAAC) new policy
to control overall ﬂight slot increase in some congested airports, CEA
targets to optimize its ﬂight routes by increasing long-distance route and
international route mix. Meanwhile, the airline also aims at improving
operating eﬃciency by minimizing ﬂights cancelation occurrence with
more backup planes.
■
Load Factor: CEA attributes the load factor decline in business routes
in August to extreme weather and large national events. The airline
estimates that the load factor will gradually recover starting September,
and sustain at a high level in future. For the international market, there
is upward load factor trend in Europe, but weaker for North America and
Korea routes.
Our price target is based on a target
1.1x FY18E P/BV. Key downside risks are
demand weakening on North Asian routes
and excessive new capacity on domestic
routes. Key upside risks are stronger-than-
expected growth in yield and return of
demand on Korean routes.
■
Direct sales: CEA’s revenue from direct sales increased 34% YoY in 3Q17,
accounting for 53% of total passenger traﬃc.
■
FX gain: CEA recorded RMB620m FX gain in 3Q17 vs. RMB410m FX
loss in 3Q16 due to the recent RMB appreciation against USD. CEA has
reduced its USD to total debt ratio to 31% in 3Q17, and the company
tends to maintain the current debt structure.
Deutsche Bank view - Buy H-shares on the expectation of improving yield
We remain optimistic on CEA's business operation despite slowing traﬃc growth,
as we expect the yield to gradually improve with a stable load factor amid slowing
capacity growth as well. We also see long-term upside potential from its low-

cost carrier unit, China United Airlines. All in all, we think CEA is better positioned
with its Shanghai hub, and all of the aforementioned factors should translate into
an improvement in CEA’s long-term earnings outlook. Hence, we maintain our
Buy rating on CEA-H, but a Sell rating on CEA-A due to the excessive A-share
valuation.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.

investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
