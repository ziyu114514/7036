We are positive on Lens’ 4Q17/2018 outlook, from the angle of high unit 
growth (driven by the rising adoption of double cover-glass design). However, 
we are concerned that the market could have overestimated its ASP growth, 
given the adoption of 3D glass (which costs 100%+ more than 2.5D glass) 
could be slower than expected. Our industry check suggests Apple is unlikely 
to adopt 3D glass in 2018. Retaining Hold rating on valuation. 
3Q17 earnings preview below expectation    
According to Lens’ 3Q17 earnings preview, 3Q17 net profit should reach 
RMB54.7mn to RMB63.0mn (+0% to +15% YoY), a deceleration from 26% YoY 
growth in 1H17 net profit. Considering the launch of iPhone 8/8 Plus with the 
new double cover-glass design, the magnitude of growth appears low. The 
mid-point of the guidance (RMB59mn) trailed our estimates and Bloomberg 
consensus by 20%-25%. Lens attributes the weakness to low capacity 
utilization and unsatisfactory production yield in its new production site. We 
believe the delay to the iPhone X launch is also partly to blame.       
Double glass remains the trend, but 3D glass adoption appears slower    
We agree that the rising adoption of a double cover-glass design on high-end 
smartphones is a clear trend for the coming two to three years (for wireless 
charging or aesthetic purposes), which is positive for a cover-glass leader like 
Lens. However, we caution that the upgrade to 3D glass (USD10+) from 2.5D 
glass (~USD4) or 2D glass has been slower than expected. Our industry check 
indicates the new iPhone in 2018 will still have 2.5D glass. Most of the high-
end smartphones from Chinese OEMs will stay with 2.5D glass too, due to cost 
concerns and durability issues (3D glass is more breakable at the edge).    
Valuation and investment risks  
We trim 2017-19 net profit forecasts by 7%-13% (to reflect lower GPM and 
ASP assumptions), but raise our TP from RMB26 to RMB29.4. Our new TP is 
still based on 22x PER, but we roll over the valuation from 22x 2017E EPS to 
22x 2018E EPS. 22x PER mirrors 0.8x PEG, in line with regional peers. 
Upside/downside risks include: strong/weak iPhone demand, ASP hike/decline, 
and market share gain/loss.

Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within

taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on.

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
