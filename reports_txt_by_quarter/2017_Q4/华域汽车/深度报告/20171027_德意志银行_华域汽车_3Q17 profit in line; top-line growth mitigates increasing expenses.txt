3Q17 proﬁt in line; top-line growth
mitigates increasing expenses
13% YoY earnings growth with ﬂat margin despite SG&A expense expansion
3Q17 gross revenue edged up by 12.1% YoY to RMB35.4bn. The revenue growth
was likely driven by production growth and new model launches from key OEM
customers and good momentum on overseas business. Meanwhile, Huayu’s
3Q17 gross proﬁt grew 12.4% YoY to RMB4.7bn with a mild 6bps YoY gross proﬁt
margin expansion. Together with 10.3% YoY growth in proﬁt contribution from its
JVs/associates, but partially oﬀset by 18.8% YoY jump in SG&A expenses, 3Q17
net proﬁt increased by 12.9% YoY to RMB1.6bn. On a 9M17 basis, Huayu’s net
proﬁt of RMB4.8bn was up 7.8% YoY and accounted for 72% of our previous
full-year FY17 earnings forecasts of RMB6.7bn (73% of Bloomberg consensus).
Therefore, we consider the results in line with our expectation.
Deutsche Bank view – favorable outlook intact with attractive valuation
We raise our FY17E revenue by 1.5% to reﬂect slightly better-than-expected 3Q17
revenue growth. However, with lower margin assumptions, we adjust down our
FY17E earnings forecasts by 0.7%. For FY18-19E, we increase revenue forecast by
9.0-9.3% and net proﬁt by 0.6-2.1% to factor in the impact from recent acquisition
of the remaining 50% stake in Shanghai Koito auto lamp JV.
Our TP is based on 12x FY18E P/E (from 10.5x, given the sector re-rating over the
past few months), in-line with Huayu’s mid-cycle P/E of 12x. This is justiﬁed as
we expect Huayu to deliver a 12.8% FY16-19E three-year net proﬁt CAGR. The
expanding overseas sales of interior trim subsidiary Yanfeng and acquisition of
auto lamp business should provide an additional growth driver. Maintain Buy on
attractive FY18E P/E of 11.3x and 4.8% dividend yield. Key downside risks: weaker
auto sales and unexpected increase in raw material prices.

in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
