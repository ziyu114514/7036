3Q17 earnings a considerable miss
with further margin deterioration
3Q17 margin worsened QoQ with ongoing discounts and more marketing
Great Wall Motor (GWM) just released its 3Q17 results earlier today. Its net
revenue grew by 1.1% YoY (22.6% QoQ) on the back of 2.1% YoY (18.5%
QoQ) vehicle sales volume growth. However, GWM's 3Q17 gross proﬁt margin
eroded by 8.5ppt YoY (1.5ppt QoQ) partly due to ongoing discounts. Together
with 30.8% YoY (16.9% QoQ) increase in SG&A expenses (due to new model
marketing and higher R&D expenses) and higher ﬁnance cost, oﬀset by higher
investment and subsidy income, GMW's net proﬁt declined 79.9% YoY (1.1%
QoQ) to RMB459.7m in 3Q17.
In 9M17, GWM’s net proﬁt was RMB2.9bn, down by 60.1% YoY, accounting for
42% of consensus and 41% of our FY17 estimate. We consider the results a miss.
Deutsche Bank view – margin recovery not visible yet to turn bullish
Since local brand competitors have been posing a greater threat in various SUV
price segments in which GWM participates, inevitably escalating costs for GWM
to defend their market position, in our view. At the moment, the company is
attempting to regain SUV market share and restore margins by oﬀering refreshed
models (e.g. the new generation Haval H6) and the upscale WEY brand. While
initial sales have been decent (e.g. 12,013 units of WEY brand sales in September),
we remain concerned that sales cannibalization, ongoing price pressure and cost
inﬂation in various aspects amid competition, will cap the extent of earnings
recovery, if any, in upcoming quarters. We currently have Sell ratings on GWM's
H shares and its A shares with target valuation at 7x FY18E P/E. Key upside
risks are stronger-than-expected sales growth, rapid margin recovery and new JV
formation. We will update more details after the company's conference call on
27 October.

described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.

investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
