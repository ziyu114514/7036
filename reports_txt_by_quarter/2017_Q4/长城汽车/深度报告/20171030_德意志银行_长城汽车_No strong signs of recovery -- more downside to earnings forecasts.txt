No strong signs of recovery -- more
downside to earnings forecasts
Tough to get back to the heyday amid competition
After listening to Great Wall Motor's (GWM) post-3Q17 results conference call, we
see one positive in the near term for the company, as Q4 sales will be supported
by the ramp-up of WEY brand sales. Yet, the negatives that made the latest results
so poor will still dominate, in our view. The painful impact of old models suﬀering
price erosion should combine with the ever-increasing competition in the SUV
segment, and we have cut our already low FY17 estimates by a further 26.8%.
This translates to another YoY drop in quarterly earnings of 12% in 4Q17E.
Looking into FY18, there will be further gains from new model launches, which
should add 1.5ppt to the gross proﬁt margin, in our estimate. However, this will
still be a long way short of the 21%-plus level seen in FY10-16. This is because
GWM would probably need to beef up expenses to keep its products competitive,
and hence we reduce our FY18/19 net proﬁt forecasts by 10.4-10.7%. Our new
target price is cut by 11%, based on 7.0x FY18E P/E (unchanged), which is below
Great Wall's historical H-share trading average, considering the lack of long-term
EPS growth. We believe that our target multiple is justiﬁed, given a FY16-19E
three-year EPS CAGR of -4%. Key upside risks are stronger-than-expected new
model sales and a margin rebound.

Post results conference call highlights
Great Wall Motor (GWM) hosted a conference call earlier today after posting an
80% YoY plunge in 3Q17 net proﬁt. Key takeaways are:
■
Management attributes the 3Q17 margin squeeze to: 1) increase in
advertising expenses; 2) oﬃcial price cuts of older products; 3) higher
sales incentives; and 4) low initial margins for the new models. Going
forward, management expects margins to rebound on rising new model
sales, partly helped by last-minute buying in 4Q17E before the end of tax
stimulus. To facilitate growth, GWM aims at having 100-150 upscale WEY
brand 4S stores by the end of 2017, and further ramp up monthly sales
for the WEY VV5 SUV to about 10k units.
■
For the new model pipeline, The WEY brand will launch a plug-in hybrid
model P8 at the end of 2017 and another model in 2018. The Haval brand
will have a completely new SUV model H4 in 2018, besides other facelifts
and new energy vehicle variants between now and 2018.
■
The annual production capacity for the in-house 7-speed DCT gearbox will
increase from 250k units in 2017 to 500k units in 2018. The gearbox will
be used in both WEY brand and Haval brand. Besides the better economy
of scale when new model sales ramp up, GWM believes that the usage
of in-house gearbox would help to lower unit costs and claims that the
new models should achieve better margins than the older models going
forward.
■
Regarding GWM's potential JV tie-up with BMW (BMWG.DE, EUR86.28,
Buy) to produce MINI vehicles in China, management said that the two
parties are still working on this project without further details to disclose.
That being said, there are still uncertainties.
■
When commenting on market competition vs. other local and JV brands,
GWM argued that some other local brands also struggled this year.
However, management still believes that GWM will stay competitive with
high value-for-money products.

Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its

in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
