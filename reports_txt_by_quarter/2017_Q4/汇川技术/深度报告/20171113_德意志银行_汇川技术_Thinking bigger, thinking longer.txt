Thinking bigger, thinking longer
An emerging national champion; raising TP
According to an ancient Chinese proverb, to win a battle, it requires the right time,
right place and right people. In the battle for market share in China's industrial
automation (IA) sector, we believe all these three factors align with Inovance.
In terms of timing, the Chinese government's strong push for manufacturing
upgrades and promotion of high-end manufacturing should help to sustain robust
IA demand in the next 10 years. On top of it, local players who focus on hardware
equipment will accelerate their market share expansion, given the government's
intention to promote local champions. Along with management's impressive
market insights and distinct "vertical-based" strategy, we believe Inovance is well
placed to top the inverter and servo markets in China by 2025. With sustainable
long-term growth and an industry-leading position, we believe the stock's current
valuation premium is warranted. We raise target price to Rmb34.3.
At the right time
"Made in China 2025" was ﬁrst unveiled in May 2015, at a time when China's
manufacturing industry and IA market were struggling. Thanks to a strong top-
down push from the government, China's IA market started to recover in 2H16,
with the recovery positively surprising in recent quarters. We view this round of
IA recovery as structural instead of cyclical, and hence we believe it is highly likely
to persist in the next 10 years. Apart from government support, manufacturers
who are facing poor quality, low eﬃciency, and labor shortages have also started
to voluntarily automate their production facilities. This trend has now spread
into traditional verticals such as textile machinery, machine tools and metallurgy,
signaling that current China's automation upgrades have become broad-based.
We expect China's overall IA demand to post a 10% CAGR in 2017-20, while
the general servo and low-voltage inverter markets, Inovance's two focused
segments, to register a CAGR of c.20% and 10%, respectively, over 2016-20 (vs.
+6% and -5% over 2011-16). Over 2021-25, we expect China's general servo and
low-voltage inverter markets to witness a CAGR of 10% and 5%, respectively (vs.
China's overall IA market: 5%).
In the right place
China's current manufacturing upgrades still largely center on hardware
equipment, which has been Inovance's strong suit. In addition, the government's
promotion of localization has been intensifying, which would accelerate local
players to gain market share. Currently, 65% of China's IA market is still

dominated by foreign players. In some of Inovance's focused markets, the ratio
can be as high as c.90%. Leveraging its deeper understanding of local customers
and improving the price-to-performance ratio of its products, Inovance has
successfully grown into a local leader capable of challenging MNCs' positions
in certain areas. Its low-voltage inverter and general servo already ranked No.3
and No.5, respectively, in China. With accelerating import substitution, we expect
Inovance to become the No.2 player in China's low-voltage inverter and No.3 in
the general servo market by 2020. By 2025, Inovance is highly likely to lead both
markets, based on our estimates.
With the right people
Inovance's success, in our view, is probably more driven by its management than
its technology and/or products. A strong evidence to support this is the local
competitors of Inovance, in our view. Several started out with similar business
at a similar time with similar technology but have fallen signiﬁcantly behind
Inovance after a decade of operations. Driven by management's aggressive
but practical manner, Inovance has successfully penetrated into multiple areas
including inverter, servo and NEV, and quickly built up a leading position.
Inovance recently launched a distinctive "vertical-based" penetration strategy
that is completely diﬀerent from its local and foreign competitors. Instead of
pushing existing products to customers, the core strategy is to focus on deeply
understanding customers' trued needs and developing customized products.
Through this practice, Inovance can not only penetrate but also quickly dominate
downstream verticals. Air compressor is a good case in point. By coming up with
customized drive solutions (inverter+controller), Inovance has rapidly occupied
more than 2/3 market share of this particular vertical. The most recent successful
cases are textile machinery and metallurgy, and we expect many other verticals
to follow.
The same thing can be said about NEV
Inovance has been a proven leader in the NEV bus drive market and we expect
such success to be repeated in the logistics and passenger NEV. Growth for
logistics NEV drive this year has been ahead of market expectation and we expect
such to continue to surprise the market on the upside. By 2020, we expect
Inovance to take a 60% share in China's logistics NEV drive market, bringing
in Rmb1bn in revenue (or 36% of the total NEV segment) and surpassing NEV
bus revenue. Meanwhile, its passenger NEV drive business is also progressing
well, having secured 5-6 tier-2 automakers and is likely to secure another 1-2
tier-1 automaker(s) by year-end. Over the longer term, we believe having a strong
electronics platform (through its IA business) will give Inovance signiﬁcant cost
advantage over its peers (e.g. lower sourcing pricing for IGBT due to larger
volume), which will further facilitate its market share expansion.
Fine-tuning earnings and raising target price; maintaining Buy
We trim our earnings estimates by 3-4% for 2017-19E, mainly reﬂecting our
more conservative assumptions on margins due to the company's heavy R&D
investment in the passenger NEV drive business. Still, our 2018-19E earnings are
5-10% higher than consensus forecasts. We see upside potential in our current
estimates as we have not factored in meaningful robots sales in coming years.
As we turn more bullish on Inovance's long-term growth prospects, we lift our
target price by 14% to Rmb34.3, after raising our long-term growth assumptions
and rolling forward our valuation timeframe to 2018. We maintain Buy.

High IA growth to sustain
The right time: China's manufacturing upgrades are
accelerating
"Made in China 2025" was ﬁrst unveiled by the State Council in May 2015, at
a time when China's manufacturing industry was clearly struggling and China's
IA market was heading south. Approximately one year after the document was
released, China's IA market started to recover thanks to the top-down push by
the government. The strength of recovery has been ahead of market expectations
so far, especially in recent quarters. Despite tougher comps, China's IA new order
growth in 3Q17 accelerated to 15% (Figure 1), much stronger than what the
market had expected.
Figure 1: Since bottoming out in 4Q15, China's IA
market has been recovering strongly, especially in recent
quarters

More importantly, growth of the OEM market (mainly equipment manufacturing
industry) has already surpassed that of the project market (or end-user verticals)
since 2013 and the gap further widened starting 2016 (Figure 2). The emergence
of the equipment manufacturing industry signals that China's "real" automation
upgrade is indeed taking place.
We believe 2013-16 probably marks the start of China's broad-based automation
upgrades and this round of upgrade cycle may last as long as 10-20 years due
to the more complicated structure of China's manufacturing industry, which is
diﬀerent from other countries (e.g. Japan's manufacturing industry is mainly
driven by 3C and automotive, etc.).
We expect China's overall IA demand to post a 10% CAGR over 2017-20E and
a CAGR of 5% over 2021-25E. We forecast the total IA market size in China to
reach c.Rmb260bn by 2025.

Low-voltage inverter: 7% CAGR over 2017-25E; a Rmb31bn market by 2025E
By varying the frequency and voltage supplied to the electric motor, inverters
can smoothly change the speed and torque of an electric motor. As electrical
machinery such as electric motors within plant facilities has become a huge
consumers of energy, inverter is critical to energy savings and eﬃciency
improvement. In China, inverter is the largest industrial drive segment, with an
annual market size of Rmb19bn in 2016.
Within China's inverter market, low-voltage inverter accounts for 85% of the total
and has been Inovance's primary focus (Figure 4). For low-voltage inverter market,
OEM market accounts for over 2/3 while project market represents the remaining
1/3. In contrast, medium/high-voltage inverter is purely driven by project market
(Figure 5).

General servos: 14% CAGR over 2017-25E; a Rmb24bn market by 2025
Servo, or more precisely, servo system, is a servo driver and a servo motor. It is
essentially an extension of inverter as servo drive is not only capable of controlling
speed and torque of a motor (as inverters do) but is also capable of providing
position control to a motor. Therefore, servo system has an extensive application
in the manufacturing sector and remains a key part of the industrial automation.
Currently, servo is still at its early stage of penetration in China, evidenced by
its much smaller market size (Rmb7.4bn) compared to inverters (Rmb19.3bn). By
downstream vertical, machine tool has been the largest one, accounting for 30%
of the total market (used to be 45% prior to 2013). On the other hand, electronics
manufacturing equipment (mainly 3C) has been the fastest-growing vertical in
recent years, accounting for c.20% of the total market in 2016 vs. <10% in 2006
(Figure 12). The two verticals combined accounted for c.50% of China's general
servo market in 2016 (Figure 11).

Most other verticals for general servos, however, have a market size of around
Rmb100-200mn (Figure 13). These small verticals are widely viewed as mid- to
low-end segments, which are the key targets for China's manufacturing upgrades.
This points to a substantial growth potential for servo market going forward.
With increasing adoption of servos, we expect China's general servo market to
post a CAGR of 19% over 2017-20, reaching Rmb15bn by 2020E (Figure 14). From
2021-25E, we expect the market to continue to witness a 10% CAGR, reaching

Inovance's sales of inverters increased >8x over 2008-16, vs. merely 18% for the
overall market. Correspondingly, Inovance's market share rose rapidly from 1% in
2008 to 10% in 2016, making it the No.3 player in China, behind ABB and Siemens
(Figure 15).
Similarly, Inovance's servos sales also increased 150% over 2011-16 (vs.+36% for
overall market). It market share increased from 4% in 2011 to 7% in 2016, ranking
No.5 in China, following Panasonic, Yaskawa, Delta and Mitsubishi (Figure 16).
While Inovance's progress is certainly encouraging, these two markets that
Inovance focused on are still very much dominated by MNCs, which have a
combined 88% share of China's general servo market and 63% of China's low-
voltage inverter market. For China's overall IA market, 65% of market share is still
controlled by MNCs currently.

While import substitution has generally turned out to be slow in China's IA market
in the last 10 years, we expect it to speed up in the coming decade. Apart from
improving product quality and lifting price-to-performance higher than MNC's,
the government's intention of raising local content would facilitate market share
gains by local players, in our view.
On accelerating import substitution, we expect Inovance to deliver stronger-than-
market growth for both inverter and servo segments. We project a revenue CAGR
of 20%+ and 40%+ for Inovance's sales of inverters and servos respectively
over 2017-20E (vs. 10% and c.20% for the respective markets in China). For
2021-2025E, we project a revenue CAGR of 10% and 16% for Inovance's sales
of inverters and servos respectively (vs. 5% and 10% CAGR for the respective
markets in China).

The right people: vertical-based sales strategy highly eﬀective in China
Inovance's success, in our view, is probably more driven by its management than
its technology and/or products. A strong evidence to support this is that several
Inovance's local competitors, who started similar business at similar time with
similar technology, have fallen way behind Inovance after a decade's operations.
Driven by management's aggressive but practical manner and strong market
insights, Inovance has successfully penetrated into multiple areas including
inverter, servo and NEV, and quickly built up a leading position.
Inovance recently launched a distinct "vertical-based" penetration strategy that is
completely diﬀerent from its local and foreign competitors (Shenzhen Inovance -
Key trip takeways: Inovance's ear is coming). Instead of pushing existing products
to customers, the core of the strategy is to focus on deeply understanding
customers' trued needs and developing customized products. Through this

practice, Inovance can not only penetrate but also quickly dominate downstream
verticals.
Air compressor is a good case in point. By coming up with customized drive
solution (inverter+controller), Inovance has rapidly occupied more than 2/3
market share of this particular vertical. The most recent successful cases are
textile machinery and metallurgy (Figure 23) and we expect many other verticals
to follow.

NEV - similar story as IA,
we believe
The right time: the global vehicle electriﬁcation trend and
Chinese government's strong push
We believe the Chinese government is determined to promote NEV, given
China's: 1) energy structure; 2) pollution concerns; and 3) ambition for technology
leadership. The recent news regarding China developing a plan to phase
out vehicles powered by fossil fuels and implementing a dual-credit scheme
exempliﬁes the government's eﬀort to accelerate the development of this market.
The government's crackdown on subsidy cheating in 2016 created disruption to
the market but the impact proved to be only short lived. After eight months of
suspending catalogue approvals, MIIT resumed approval process in December
2016. Since February, China's NEV market has staged a strong recovery, with
volume growth accelerating to 78% in September.
Although YTD sales of NEV bus still register negative growth, volume has reverted
to positive growth since June (Figure 25). On the other hand, sales volume
of passenger NEV has been strong since February and the strength further
accelerated to close to 100% in September (Figure 24).

Moreover, after logistic NEV was included in MIIT's catalogue of vehicles eligible
for incentives for the ﬁrst time in December 2016, we are seeing a steady
proportion of the catalogue coming from logistics NEV models (Figure 26), which
now accounts for c.25% of the total catalogue approvals so far this year (Figure

The right place: third-party suppliers to prevail over
automakers in China's NEV controller market
Electrical controller is indeed an application of Inovance's drive technology in
the NEV ﬁeld. Through the exclusive supply agreement with the local bus leader
Yutong, Inovance successfully established its footprint in this market.
At the current stage, in-house production and sourcing from third-party providers
are main options for NEV automakers. The two parties largely equally share the
market. BYD, being the major one adopting in-house production, accounts for
25% of total NEV controller market (Figures 28 and 29).

Based on 2016 data, Yutong's leading position in China's NEV bus market helped
lift Inovance ranking to No.4 in China's NEV controller market, coming after BYD,
BAIC and UAES. Excluding automakers, Inovance ranked No.2 in 2016, after
UAES, a JV between SAIC and Bosch, which mainly focuses on passenger NEV.

Although automakers have strong intention to master the core technology, most
local automakers are ﬁnal assemblers that lack R&D capability to support in-
house production. Moreover, when production volume ramps up signiﬁcantly,
substantial quality risk and cost pressure would emerge, which would make
in-house production a less optimal option. Third-party suppliers could take
advantage of economies of scales by supplying products to the entire industry
while most mid to small automakers can not. We therefore believe third-party
OEMs will likely gradually gain market share as NEV sales rise.
We believe the competitive landscape for China's third-party NEV drive market is
still evolving especially for the passenger NEV segment. Although earlier movers
such as UAES and Shanghai E-drive have already established their footprint in this
market, we believe Inovance can still penetrate and grab decent market share,
leveraging its core competence in drive ﬁeld, track record in NEV bus area, and
cooperation with Brusa.
Cost advantage could be Inovance's key competitiveness over the long run
Moreover, as volume signiﬁcantly ramps up, we believe Inovance's strong cost
competitiveness will enable the company to stand out. Compared to other
dedicated third-party NEV driver producers, Inovance has a strong electronics
platform (due to its IA business), which would oﬀer substantial cost advantage
(e.g. lower sourcing prices for IGBT and capacitors due to larger purchasing
volume) since IA and NEV have a large overlap for certain core components. In the
long term, as NEV volume signiﬁcantly ramps up, automakers will likely become
increasingly more cost conscious. Therefore, we believe Inovance's strong cost
competitiveness will facilitate its market share expansion in future.
The right people: we like management's strategy
developed for passenger NEV
Inovance has been a proven NEV drive leader in the NEV bus segment but
relatively new to the passenger NEV segment. While being the exclusive NEV
controller supplier of Yutong Bus is an endorsement of Inovance's product quality
and technology, breaking into passenger OEM's supply chain system is not easy
given rigorous requirements for product safety and quality, which requires high
R&D investment and close cooperation with auto OEMs.
Fully realizing the challenges, management of Inovance has come up with three
strategies:
■
Inosa: Inovance established Inosa in September 2016 by cooperating
with Brusa, which was founded in 1985 and is mainly involved in electric
motors and components for NEV (including controller, DC/DC converter,
charger, etc.). Brusa's product line coupled with its leading technology
in NEV ﬁeld makes it a nice complement for Inovance. While currently
Inovance is mainly focusing on NEV controller, in the longer term,
Inovance will develop its electric motor as well as gearbox by leveraging
Brusa's advantages.
■
Better product integration: Existing local players have focused on
oﬀering controller plus motor solutions but Inovance is taking this
one step further by oﬀering 3-in-1 powertrain solutions consisting of
controller, motor and gearbox. The beneﬁts to automobile manufacturers
are clear – reduced weight and size with no extra cabling between the
Deutsche Bank AG/Hong Kong
Page 13
7 November 2017
Manufacturing
Shenzhen Inovance Technology Co., Ltd.
motor and inverter enable the simple integration of the drive units within
the vehicle architecture. The company will eventually produce all three
components internally. In the near term, Inovance will likely provide
motor and controller separately for local NEV makers, mastering the
powertrain technology will prepare Inovance for the likely intensifying
competition when foreign NEV automakers start to aggressively enter
the China market possibly in 2019.
■
ISO certification: While it is not yet strictly required by local NEV OEMs,
getting ISO certiﬁed (ISO26262 in this case) – one of the highest safety-
related certiﬁcations globally – is an endorsement of product safety
and quality. Inovance is the ﬁrst local player to successfully roll out
automated production lines and obtain the ISO26262 certiﬁcation for
its NEV drive business. Our channel checks also suggest most local
passenger NEV drive suppliers have not been certiﬁed.
Leveraging Brusa’s leading technology and Inovance’s sound strategies (i.e.
providing integrated powertrain & acquiring ISO certiﬁcate), we are increasingly
conﬁdent that Inovance will repeat its success in the passenger NEV ﬁeld.
2017-19: logistics NEV to drive growth; beyond 2019:
passenger NEV to take oﬀ
Although NEV bus fell short of expectations so far this year, due to weak volume
from Yutong as well as iASP cut, logistic NEV positively surprised YTD and will
likely continue to exceed expectations in the coming years. Management recently
also raised its full-year revenue target for its logistics NEV segment to Rmb350m
(from Rmb200m guided at the beginning of 2017).
We estimate that the market size of China's logistics NEV drive market will
probably be around Rmb800-900m in 2017 (volume of 100k units x ASP of
Rmb8-9k), which means that Inovance occupies c.40% market share. We expect
the overall market to continue to register a 22% CAGR over 2018-2020 and
Inovance to further grow its market share to 60% by 2020E. This suggests that
Inovance's logistic NEV revenue will grow at a CAGR of 33% over 2018-20E, more
than oﬀset the potential softness from NEV bus. Based on this trend, we expect
its logistics NEV to surpass the NEV bus segment and become the largest revenue
contributor for the whole NEV segment starting 2019 (Figure 31).
In terms of passenger NEV business, despite surging opex which pressured
Inovance's proﬁtability in 2017, the heavy investment in passenger NEV has
ﬁnally started to show progress. In 1H17, Inovance managed to secure 5-6
tier-2 passenger NEV customers to supply its controller products. Management
is conﬁdent that it can secure 1-2 tier-1 passenger NEV customer(s) in 2H17 and
expects the business to take oﬀ in 2019.
We expect Inovance's sales of passenger NEV controller to post a CAGR of 133%
over 2017-20. By 2020, we expect Inovance to take a 10% share in China's
passenger NEV controller market, with revenue contribution reaching c.Rmb1bn.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
