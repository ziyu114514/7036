A weak 3Q17 with intense margin
pressure is a miss to us
47% YoY 3Q17 net proﬁt decline on margin contraction, despite ﬂattish sales
Chang’an Auto released its 3Q17 results earlier today. The company’s 3Q17
net revenue increased 1.5% YoY to RMB17.3bn despite an 11.1% YoY drop in
local brand vehicle sales volume to 286k units, probably due to increasing SUV
sales mix, in our view. However, Chang'an's 3Q17 gross proﬁt margin eroded by
10.6ppt YoY, probably due to ﬁerce competition, in our view, oﬀset the 6.7ppt
YoY drop in the SG&A ratio. In addition, there was an 27.2% YoY earnings
contribution decline from its JVs/associates, driven by a 14.4% YoY sales volume
drop at Chang’an Ford, probably due to an aging product portfolio, in our view.
Altogether, Chang'an's 3Q17 net proﬁt fell by 47.1% YoY to RMB2.4bn. On a 9M17
basis, Changan's net proﬁt of RMB5.8bn was down 24.9% YoY and accounted for
64% of our original FY17 earnings forecasts of RMB9.0bn. Therefore, we consider
the results a miss to our expectations.
Deutsche Bank view – competitive pressure makes us more downbeat
With the originally popular products' sales momentum weakening and limited
new 'killer' products in sight, especially at the major earnings contributor
Chang’an Ford, we doubt that Chang’an can stage a strong earnings rebound in
the upcoming quarters. Although we raise our FY17-19 net revenue forecast by
2.8-8.6% on higher local brand sales and higher SUV mix assumption, we cut
our FY17-19E net proﬁt by 8.0-9.1%, mainly on lower margin assumptions for the
local brands and the JVs amid competitive pressure.
We value Chang'an at 7.5x FY18E P/E (from 7.0x, considering the sector re-
rating over the past few months), which is below the company's historical trading
average. In our view, this is justiﬁed, as we expect Chang'an to suﬀer net proﬁt
decline going forward (-4% FY16-19E CAGR) vs. strong growth in the past (45%
FY13-16 CAGR). Given a lack of share price upside potential vs. our target
price, we maintain our Hold rating. Key downside risks include: 1) weaker-than-
expected vehicle sales, 2) pricing pressure and 3) worse-than-expected local
brand proﬁtability. Key upside risks include: 1) better-than-expected new and old
models sales and 2) a stronger-than-expected earnings rebound at the local brand.

liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no
less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to time discuss with
our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report

situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments

judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
