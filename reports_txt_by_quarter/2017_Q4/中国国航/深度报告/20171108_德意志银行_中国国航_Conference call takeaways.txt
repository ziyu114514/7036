Conference call takeaways
Air China hosted a post-1H17-results conference call on 30 October. The key
takeaways are as follows:
■
Yield: With prudent yield management, Air China recorded 4-5% YoY
passenger yield growth in 3Q17 on strong growth in certain international
routes (e.g. Europe and Africa), partially oﬀset by marginal decline in
domestic yield (mainly due to severe weather and competition from high-
speed railway). The airline expects the healthy yield trend to continue.
■
Capacity: In 3Q17, Air China recorded 7.7% passenger capacity (ASK) YoY
growth with 1.9ppt YoY contraction in load factor. For 4Q17E, the airline
plans to expand ASK by 9-10%, with domestic ASK likely to increase
by 5-6% and international ASK to increase by 15%. Air China also does
not see much impact by the regulator's (CAAC) new policy to control
overall ﬂight slot increase in some congested airports on the airline's ASK
planning.
■
Cargo business: Air China's cargo business recorded an excellent yield
in 3Q17. The airline managed to raise price signiﬁcantly in Europe and
America routes while maintaining traﬃc growth. Air China plans to add
more capacity by transferring staﬀ from the passenger business to the
cargo business and they still see room for yield improvement.
Our target price for Air China is based
on 1.05x FY18E P/BV. We believe the
valuation benchmark is prudent, given 9%
FY18E core ROE. Key downside risks include
excessive new capacity on international
routes, and weakening in Cathay Paciﬁc's
earnings contribution. Key upside risks are
the reverse of the aforementioned points.
■
Investment income: Management conﬁrmed that the YoY slump in
3Q17 JV/associate earnings contribution (down 54.7% YoY) was mainly
attributable to losses at Cathay Paciﬁc (0293.HK, HKD11.62, Sell).
Nonetheless, as Cathay Paciﬁc has started a cost control program in 2017
to save c. HKD4bn in 3 years, and also has an extra plan to trim human
resource expenses, Air China believes that Cathay Paciﬁc should be on its
way to an earnings recovery.
■
USD debt: Air China recorded FX gain of RMB2.2bn in 9M17 vs. FX loss of
RMB2.2bn in 9M16 due to RMB appreciation against USD year-to-date.
The airline has reduced its USD debt ratio to 40% at the end of September

Deutsche Bank's view - solid core business partially oﬀset by Cathay weakness
We think that Air China's 3Q17 results, with decent yield growth and controlled
cost increases, well demonstrate its fundamental strength vs. local peers. That
being said, we remain concerned that the airline's earnings upside will likely be
capped by Cathay Paciﬁc's weakness in the near future. Therefore, we maintain
a Hold on Air China H shares. Meanwhile, we have a Sell rating on its A shares,
given their signiﬁcant valuation premium over the H-shares.

described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient

their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this
information before investing.
