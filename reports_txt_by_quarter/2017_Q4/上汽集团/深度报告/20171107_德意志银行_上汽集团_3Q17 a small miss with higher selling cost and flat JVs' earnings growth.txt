3Q17 a small miss with higher selling
cost and ﬂat JVs' earnings growth
8% 3Q16 net proﬁt YoY growth on decent sales at both local brands and JVs
SAIC Motor released 3Q17 results after the market close on 30 October. The
company’s 3Q17 gross revenue grew 17.4% YoY to RMB211.6bn, on the back
of 11.3% growth in vehicle sales volume during the period, probably due to
product mix improvement. Meanwhile, SAIC Motor’s 3Q17 gross proﬁt rose
26.1% YoY to RMB29.7bn with 1.0ppt YoY gross proﬁt margin improvement,
possibly also due to better sales mix. Yet with a 46.7% higher selling expense
YoY and ﬂat proﬁt contribution from its JVs (despite 9.7% and 7.7% YoY sales
volume growth at SAIC Volkswagen and SAIC GM, respectively), 3Q17 net proﬁt
increased only 8.1% YoY to RMB8.7bn. On a 9M17 basis, SAIC Motor’s net proﬁt
of RMB24.6bn was up 6.7% YoY, accounting for 70% of DB's FY17 forecast
and 68% of Bloomberg's full-year FY17 forecast. We consider the results slightly
below expectations as nine months' net proﬁt accounted for 71-72% of full-year
net proﬁts in the past two years.
Deutsche Bank view – stable earnings growth and attractive yield in the price
Going forward, we expect SAIC Motor's 4Q17 sales momentum to be sustained
with year-end sales rush and further product mix improvement. However, we
think that extra promotional eﬀorts will be needed to push sales amid intensifying
competition. All in all, we envision a stable earnings growth trajectory for the
company, which should support its generous dividend payout. We maintain Hold
on SAIC Motor because we think the current valuation is fair.
We raise our FY17-19 revenue forecasts marginally, by 3.7-5.2%, on higher sales
volume estimates, but trim our FY17-19 net proﬁt forecasts 0.3-2.1% mainly
on lower consolidated EBIT margin assumptions. We value SAIC Motor at 9.5x
FY18E P/E (from 9x FY18E given recent auto rector re-rating), which is above the
company's historical trading average and close to the industry's long-term P/E
average. This is justiﬁed, in our view, as we expect SAIC Motor to achieve a three-
year net proﬁt CAGR of 7% in FY16-19. On a P/BV basis, we believe the company's
implied FY18E target P/BV of 1.5x is justiﬁed, considering its 16-17% sustainable
ROE.
Key downside risks include: 1) a weak reception for its new models from various
SAIC brands; 2) pricing pressure amid industry competition; and 3) worse-
than-expected local brand proﬁtability. Key upside risks include: 1) better-than-

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
