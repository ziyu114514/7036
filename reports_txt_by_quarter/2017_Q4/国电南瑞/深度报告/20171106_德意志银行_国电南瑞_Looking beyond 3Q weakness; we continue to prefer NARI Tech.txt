Looking beyond 3Q weakness; we
continue to prefer NARI Tech
We see a broad weakness from China A-share power T&D equipment names’ 3Q
earnings reporting: NARI Tech +5% (vs. 1H’s +25%, dragged by solar EPC), XJ
Electric +4% (vs. 1H’s +46%, lower margin) and Pinggao Electric down 69% (vs.
1H’s down 35%, lower margin/UHVAC delay). However, when looking into the
underlying operations, we ﬁnd NARI Tech’s 3Q proﬁt weakness is relatively more
temporary than structural, with core grid business growth/margins and order
momentum remaining on track. Its parentco asset injection has been approved
by SASAC, Ministry of Commerce and CSRC and is expected to be completed
by end of this November. We continue to prefer NARI Tech in the sector on
relative better earnings defensiveness and growth sustainability against industry
headwinds (grid investment downturn, margin pressure, etc.), stronger parentco
support, which should justify a valuation premium vs. peers.
Solar EPC, a near-term earnings dragger, expected to be removed next year
NARI Tech’s 3Q revenue/net proﬁt growth weakened to +4%/5%, respectively,
from +11%/25% in 1H. This was mainly dragged by the shrinking solar EPC
business (under power generation & renewable energy segment), which has
incurred a net loss of c.Rmb70m in 9M17 due to margin contraction amid
intensiﬁed pressure passed through by customers and competition. Management
expects it will remain an earnings dragger into 4Q this year, which may lead the
company’s full-year earnings growth (before asset consolidation) to fall between
10-20% (prior guidance: +20%). However, this impact should be temporary and
will be removed by next year, as management targets to speed up exiting this
low-margin business by next year.
Core business performance still on track
Putting solar EPC business aside, NARI Tech’s 3Q core power automation
business growth remains stable at close to 20%; rail automation proﬁt tracks
15-20% growth excluding PPP project contribution, according to management.
GPM advanced by 1.6ppt on favorable product mix and resilient margins for
secondary grid automation business. Total order intake growth in 9M17 stays
similar to 1H’s 18%. At consolidated level after asset injection, management
expects it is largely on track to achieve close to 20% earnings growth target, with
accelerated UHV order delivery this year.
More defensive in weathering through industry headwinds
Against industry headwinds, including shrinking grid Capex (as guided by
State Grid recently for next ﬁve years) and persistent margin pressure on

competition, we believe NARI Tech will demonstrate increasingly higher earnings
defensiveness and sustainability vs peers, with 1) favorable product positioning in
the growing secondary automation/ﬂexible transmission market, both with high
entry-barriers, 2) strong R&D capability and highly market-based compensation
scheme to grow new products and non-grid markets.
Strong Parentco support; targets set for both asset size and market cap
Mr. Shu Yinbiao, Chairman of State Grid, explicitly expressed support for
NARI Group during his company visit this August, in terms of 1) earnings
delivery, 2) high-proﬁle tech projects, 3) employee stock options, 3) new product
qualiﬁcation. In addition, he sets a “double 100billion” (assets and market cap)
targets by 2020 for NARI Tech, incentivizing NARI’s management in terms of both
earnings growth and share price performance.
A recap of XJ and Pinggao Electric's 3Q resutls
XJ Electric's 3Q revenue and NP decelerated to 5%/4% vs. 12%/46% in 1H.
Although 3Q NP was partially aﬀected by higher asset impairment, GPM (+0.7ppt)
continues to disappoint considering much more high-margin UHVDC revenue
yoy. Management reckons margin pressure to persist, especially for low-voltage
primary equipment and EV charging business. Additionally, shrinking domestic
UHVDC orders will weigh on its earnings outlook next year, although in longer
term this could be partially oﬀset by growing ﬂexible DC transmission and export.
Pinggao Electric recorded a widened NP decline in 3Q (down 69%) vs. down
35% in 1H, mainly hit by >10% lower price and delayed delivery for UHVAC GIS,
shrinking high-voltage GIS revenue and higher raw material costs. Low-voltage
products and exports are growing, but could not help enough. Moreover, we see
its earnings growth remains uncertain and the downturn could be structural, given
1) UHVAC project approval has been put on hold at government level due to power
oversupply and safety controversy; 2) high-voltage grid investment will continue
to scale down.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
