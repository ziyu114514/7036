In-line quarter led by manufacturing

Solid OCF generation in 3Q17
Shanghai Pharma reported revenue / core proﬁt of RMB33.3bn / 685m in 3Q17,
representing YoY growth of 7.9% / 0.5% respectively, moderating from 1H17
growth of 10%/11%. Growth in the distribution arm was dragged down by two
invoice policy and broad reform headwinds, while anemic proﬁt growth was due
to the high base last year from JV contributions. The manufacturing segment
remained the bright spot with 22% growth in 3Q17, or 11% on an organic
basis. Contributions from Vitaco and acquired assets in 3Q17 were approximately
RMB280m and RMB65m, respectively. We highlight the solid cash generation
abilities of SPH, with RMB1.1bn OCF inﬂow in 3Q17, compared with RMB850m
inﬂow in 3Q16. We maintain Buy on SPH-H on its valuation and growth outlook;
Hold for SPH-A.
Distribution decelerated, while manufacturing continues to deliver
Pharma distribution registered a growth deceleration in 3Q17, registering YoY
growth of -9.6%, compared to 10%/16% in 1H17/2016. On the contrary, organic
growth at the manufacturing arm accelerated to 11% YoY in 3Q17, compared
to 7%/5% in 1H17/2016. Executives expect to capture opportunities arising from
the outﬂow of prescription drugs, supported by the derivative business, including
commercial healthcare insurance and Yiyao e-commerce.
Margin expansion driven by higher DS contributions
GM/OPM increased to 12.1% and 3.9% in 3Q17, compared to 11.3%/3.4%
in 3Q16. Gross margin expansion was driven by a growth acceleration at
DS and a lower contribution from the IDS segment. OPM improvements are
largely attributed to lower selling/marketing expenses and improving operational
eﬃciency. Going forward, management expects ﬁnancing costs to trend upward
slightly, on the back of an upward interest rate revision cycle. AR and inventory
days were largely stable, registering 97/51 days in 3Q17, compared with 96/49
days in 3Q16. AP days increased from 83 days in 3Q16 to 100 days this quarter,
suggesting enhanced operational liquidity despite reform challenges.
Maintaining PT of HKD24.5 for SPH-H and RMB21.3 for SPH-A; risks
We derive our target price from 16.5x 2018E EPS. We believe SPH deserves a
slight premium for its high earnings visibility and future acquisition opportunities,
compared to peers trading at 15x with 12% growth in 2018E (vs. the 10% we

3Q17 recap
We highlight the following key updates during 3Q17:
■
Impact of two-invoice system: Management expects the gradual
implementation to continue to exert pressure on its IDS segment, while
the DS businesses are likely to enjoy above-industry growth and further
margin expansion. We estimate the net loss to its IDS business could
be close to RMB10bn in FY2018, as reform implementation accelerates.
Nevertheless, GM is likely to continue to trend higher as the percentage
of DS increases in the next few quarters. We remind investors that DS/
IDS remain steady at c. 70% / 30%, respectively.
■
Distribution: DS delivered signiﬁcant outperformance vs. IDS in
provinces with policy implementation. According to the company, it
achieved 8%+/ 14.7%/ 24.3% in Anhui/ Hunan and Shaanxi provinces
respectively. For Anhui in particular, DS growth stood above 8% while
IDS recorded only 4.5% during the same period. In the aforementioned
three provinces, SPH achieved market share expansion as a result of a
favorable policy.
■
Manufacturing business: SH Pharma achieved organic growth
acceleration in its manufacturing franchise at 11%/ 7%/ 5% in
3Q17/ 1H17/ 2016, respectively. Notably, sales from Vitaco registered
RMB280m in 3Q17, while two more acquisitions from Gansu and Tianjin
generated RMB65m to the top line.
■
On M&A: Shanghai Pharma is actively reviewing favorable targets for
acquisitions, with the following selection criteria: 1) an expanding
footprint in previously non-covered regions; 2) companies with a
competitive edge in speciﬁc disease TA. On overseas acquisitions, SH
Pharma will focus mainly on companies with specialty pharma, patented
drugs or products with high entry barriers.
■
Geographical breakdown: Zero mark-up policy in Beijing reduced
overall ASP by 9-10% during Apr-Sep 17, and volume growth stood at
approximately 10%, maintaining ﬂat YoY growth for Beijing revenue.
Executives believe that the majority of the negative impact is already
reﬂected in the ﬁrst few months. Going forward, SH Pharma expects
stable growth in the distribution arm from the Beijing region.

or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no
less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to time discuss with
our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report

situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
