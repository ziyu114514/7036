3Q17 result strong beat; reiterating Buy
Sales more than doubled in 3Q helped by increasing volume
Kweichow Moutai reported 3Q17 results with a 120% yoy sales increase to
RMB18.9bn and 140% yoy net profit increase to RMB8.7bn. The sales growth
was much higher than our forecast at 40% for 3Q, and tracks ahead of street's full
year forecast at 27% yoy growth for FY17. Particularly, the strong sales growth
is driven by:
■
Around 70% yoy volume growth for mainstream Moutai (DB estimates).
To recap, Moutai indicated on August 28 that it supplied 6,200 tons of
liquor (including 5,600 tons of "Feitian Moutai" and 600 tons of other
SKUs) between August 15 and September 30, to meet the strong demand
during National Holiday and Mid-Autumn Festival, implying 70% yoy
growth.
■
Strong growth of super premium Moutai. We estimated that most of 600
tons of other SKU are super premium Moutai. This drives mix-upgrade for
mainstream Moutai.
■
Strong growth of mass market Moutai products. According to news from
Moutai website, mass market Moutai sales increased over 200% yoy
in the ﬁrst 9 months. This is a result of Moutai's "133" brand strategy
(one core brand, three strategy brands - Huamao, Wangmao, Laimao,
and three key brands - Hanjiang, Renjiu and Wangzi). Meanwhile, the
number of domestic distributors increased by 634 YTD to 2,965, mainly
for penetration of mass market Moutai.
Net margin expanded 440bps yoy on operating leverage
Moutai's gross margin was stable at 75% in 3Q17, as the impact from lower
margin mass-market products was oﬀset by high margin customized Moutai.
Selling expense ratio increased 20bps yoy to 3.2%, due to increasing A&P expense
for its "133" brand strategy and "5+5" channel strategy (5 core markets and 5
potential markets). G&A expense ratio declined 480bps yoy , mainly helped by
operating leverage.
Increasing transparency in revenue recognition
Moutai booked most ex-factory shipments as revenue in 3Q17. This is diﬀerent
from market's and our expectation that it would allocate the shipments into sales
and advances from customer accounts. Therefore, advances from customers

were stable at Rmb17bn on Sep 30 (vs Rmb18bn on June 30). This partly
contributed to the results beat in 3Q. We believe this implies increasing
transparency and improving cooperate governance for the company.
Reiterating Buy with new target price at Rmb650
We are revising up our earnings forecast by 1-4% in 2017-19E, to factor in the
better than expected sales growth. We revise up our target price by 6% to
Rmb650, based on a DCF method (factoring in 9.5% WACC and a 2% TGR). The
stock currently trades at 25x 2018 and 22x 2019 P/E with 26% earnings CAGR in
2017-19E. We expect street to revise up earnings forecasts and trigger further re-
ratings. We reiterate Buy. Main downside risks: shorter-than-expected restocking
cycle; government policy changes; food safety incidents.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the

to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
