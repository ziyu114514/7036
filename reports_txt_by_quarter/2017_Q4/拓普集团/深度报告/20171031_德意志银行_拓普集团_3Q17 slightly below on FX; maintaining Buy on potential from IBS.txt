3Q17 slightly below on FX; maintaining
Buy on potential from IBS
6% proﬁt YoY with strong top-line growth oﬀset by margin and FX
3Q17 gross revenue edged up 25.8% YoY to RMB1.2bn, likely driven by strong
orders from local brands OEM customers, such as Geely, SAIC Roewe, and
GAC Trumpchi. Gross proﬁt rose 20.0% YoY to RMB324.2m with a 1.3ppt YoY
gross proﬁt margin contraction, mainly due to product mix deterioration with less
contribution from shock absorber and intelligent braking segments, in our view.
Together with a ﬂattish SG&A to sales ratio in 3Q17, oﬀset by FX losses (due to
RMB appreciation vs. USD) and lower other operating income, 3Q17 net proﬁt
increased only mildly, 5.8% YoY to RMB164.1m.
On a 9M17 basis, Tuopu's net proﬁt of RMB551.1m was up 30.1% YoY and
accounted for 70% of our full-year FY17 forecast and 67% of the Bloomberg
consensus FY17 estimate. Therefore, we consider the results as a slight miss to
both our and consensus expectations.
Deutsche Bank view – Buy on growth potential from ADAS
We believe Tuopu will continue to beneﬁt from the rapid growth momentum
at its key OEM customers and expect Noise, Vibration and Harshness (NVH)
parts to remain the company's major revenue contributor. In addition, we remain
optimistic on the growth potential of Intelligent Braking System (IBS) and Electric
Vacuum Pump (EVP) products.
Our target price is set at a target 26x FY18E P/E (unchanged), near with its mid-
cycle P/E of 28x. Key downside risks: weaker-than-expected auto sales volume;
failure to record new order awards for IBS/EVP products; and unexpected increase
in raw material prices.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this
information before investing.
