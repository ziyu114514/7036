3Q17 earnings beat; reiterating Buy on
continued sales recovery
Sales/net proﬁt is 3.5%/4.4% higher than DB forecast
Yili reported 18% yoy sales growth to Rmb19.0bn and 34% net proﬁt growth to
Rmb1.6bn in 3Q17.  Net profit is 4.4% higher than DB forecast. The earnings beat
is mainly driven by better-than-expected market share gains. The strong earnings
growth is driven by:
■
Strong sales growth on recovering sector growth and market share
gains. We estimate the industry retail growth recovered from low single
digit in 3Q16 to high single digit in 3Q17, helped by less price discount
on more balanced supply. Meanwhile, Yili's market share in Ambient/
chilled products/IMF expanded from 31%/15%/5.7% to 34%/16%/6%
respectively (Figure 1).
■
Selling expense/sales ratio declined 100bps yoy to 21.9%, helped by
easing of competition within a more balanced supply environment.
■
G&A expense declined 150bps yoy to 6.2% from a high base, as Yili
incurred incremental G&A for some one-oﬀ event (i.e. internal property
maintenance).
■
SG&A expense savings was partly offset by 102bps yoy decline in gross
margin, due to rising raw milk and packaging prices.
Improving inventory turnover indicates that 4Q growth to remain strong
Inventory days improved from 31.9 days in 3Q16 to 30 days in 3Q17. Given the
production date is an important decision factor when consumers choose brands
in retail ends, the shorten inventory days indicate improving fresh level of the
products, which should help to drive its sales growth in 4Q17. The improving
inventory days also indicate a more balanced supply and demand market.
We expect the recovery trend to continue with an under supply environment
We believe Yili's growth recovery from 2Q is mainly driven by more balanced
supply from 2017. After three years capacity reductions for upstream dairy farms
from 2014, raw milk supply is becoming more balanced with demand from 2017.
During the over supply environment, smaller dairy players could source raw milk
at a heavy discount compared with large brands, but during the under supply

environment from 2017, smaller players need to pay a premium instead. This helps
large players such as Yili and Mengniu to gain market share.
Reiterating Buy
We are revising up our earnings forecast by 2-4% in 2017-19E, mainly to factor
in higher-than-expected sales driven by Yili's market share gains. We revise up
our TP by 13% to Rmb31.6 based on a DCF approach, factoring in a 9.5% WACC
(3.9% RFR, 5.6% ERP, 1.0 beta, debt-free structure) and 2% terminal growth. We
reiterate Yili as our top pick among our A share coverage. Downside risks: higher-
than-expected raw material price increase, food safety incidents and worse-than-
expected competition.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
