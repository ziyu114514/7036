on estimated for illustration purpose.  
 
We expect the dairy sector to enter an undersupply cycle from 2018. In this 
new cycle, competition will switch from price to raw milk sourcing. Helped by 
their closer relationship with dairy farms, Mengniu and Yili should be able to 
gain market share faster in the next three years. Meanwhile, rising raw milk 
cost could be mostly offset by lower selling expenses and price increases, as 
we have seen in past cycles. We expect continued re-ratings for Mengniu and 
Yili within the new cycle and we reiterate Buy on both. 
The undersupply and oversupply cycles of the past six years  
The dairy sector experienced an undersupply cycle in 2011-13 and an 
oversupply cycle in 2014-16. During the undersupply cycle, Mengniu and Yili 
posted 13% and 17% sales CAGR, driven by market share gains, as smaller 
players had to source raw milk at a higher price. Yet operating margins for 
both companies expanded during the period, helped by lower selling expense 
and price hike in 2013. During the oversupply cycle, both companies’ sales 
growth slowed down to high-single digit CAGR, because oversupply resulted 
in increasing competition at the retail end, as the smaller players can source 
milk at a much lower price. For Mengniu and Yili, the cost savings at a lower 
milk price are mostly offset by rising selling expenses.  
Entering a new undersupply cycle in 2017-19  
After three years’ capacity reduction on upstream from 2H14, the sector’s 
supply is rebalancing with demand from 2017. Given it takes two years for a 
calf to grow up to be a milkable cow, we expect the shortage cycle to continue 
in 2018-19. Similar to the previous shortage cycle in 2011-13, we expect both 
Mengniu and Yili to gain more market share in 2017-19. Actually, Mengniu/ 
Yili’s sales growth recovered to double digits in 3Q17, faster than industry’s 
mid-single-digit growth. Meanwhile, we expect Mengniu’s and Yili’s margins 
to expand in 2018-19, as the rising raw milk price will be fully offset by lower 
selling expense, fewer price discounts and potential ex-factory price hikes.  
The cycle is just beginning; reiterating Buy on Mengniu and Yili  
Mengniu and Yili have rallied 44% and 74% YTD, driven by the early signs of 
industry recovery. We think the recovery is a structural trend for the next three 
years and expect the two names to continue to deliver sustained sales growth. 
We raise our target price for Mengniu to HK$26.8 and our target price for Yili 
to RMB35.0 based on DCF method (factoring in 3.9% RFR, 5.6% ERP, 1.0 beta, 
debt-free structure and 2% terminal growth). The next catalyst will be their 
result reporting dates. Downside risks: food safety, and oversupply.

Investment summary  
Mengniu and Yili’s sales growths are recovering from 2017 after two years’ 
weak growth. The market generally believes this is due to a recovery in dairy 
demand. However, we believe this is more because of changing raw milk 
supply cycles. We expect the dairy sector to switch from an oversupply cycle 
to an undersupply cycle from 2017. In the new cycle, small brands will face 
increasing raw milk cost and losing market share to large brands. We expect 
the undersupply cycle to be sustained into 2018-19, which should lead to 
faster market share gains for Mengniu and Yili.  
We are raising our earnings forecasts for Mengniu and Yili, and lifting our 
target price for Mengniu to HK$26.8 and our target price for Yili to RMB35, 
both based on DCF approach. We reiterate Buy on the two stocks.

The historical milk supply cycles 
Unlike most other staples segments, dairy names’ operations are highly 
affected by the supply situation of the upstream dairy farms. Raw milk, the 
major raw material of the dairy sector, is cyclical in supply and has a very short 
shelf life. Meanwhile, an oversupply or an undersupply cycle normally lasts for 
two to three years, because it takes two years for a newborn calf to grow up to 
become a milkable cow. China experienced undersupply in 2011-1H14 and 
oversupply in 2H14-2016.

Source: Deutsche Bank, moa.gov.cn; future raw milk prices are DB forecast.  
In an undersupply cycle, the competition arises mainly in raw milk sourcing, 
and large brands (Mengniu and Yili) are better positioned than smaller brands, 
because large dairy names generally have long-term contracts and closer 
relationships with upstream dairy farms. For example, Mengniu signed a 10-
year contract with China Modern Dairy in 2008. Meanwhile, large brands have 
a national raw milk sourcing network and can ship more milk from production 
regions (north China) to consumption regions (south and east china). Large 
brands tend to gain more share in the cycle.  
During the 2011-1H14 undersupply cycle, Mengniu and Yili recorded sales 
growth of 13%/17% in 2011-13 helped by market share gains (Figure 6). 
Meanwhile, though Yili’s and Mengniu's gross margins declined during the 
period due to rising raw milk price, their core OP margins expanded from 
1.9%/4.4% in 2010 to 8.5%/5.9% in 2014, as the rising raw milk cost was fully 
offset by fewer price promotions, mix upgrade, and a 5-17% price hike in 2013.  
In an oversupply cycle, the competition switches back to sales and marketing, 
and small brands are better positioned. It is easier for small local brands to 
source milk at a much lower price, because dairy farms have strong incentives 
to sell out all extra milk. Dairy farms also sell milk directly to retail ends. This 
leads to heavy price competition at the retail end. However, due to their closer 
relationships and long-term contracts with large dairy farms, large brands 
cannot cut procurement volume immediately and revise down sourcing price 
too aggressively.

For example, in 2016, a dairy farm we visited supplied Mengniu/Yili at RMB3.5-
3.8/kg, but supplied its extra milk to smaller local brands at RMB2/kg. Yet, 
from 3Q17, the dairy farm was still selling to Mengniu/Yili at RMB3.5-3.8/kg, 
but selling to smaller brands at RMB3.9/kg. 
During the 2H14-2016 oversupply cycle, Yili and Mengniu saw a slowdown in 
sales to 8%/7% CAGR in 2014-16, due to increasing competition from small 
local players. Though the gross margins of both companies expanded, helped 
by declining raw milk price and product mix upgrade, Yili and Mengniu's core 
OP margins changed by 10bps/-260bps in 2014-2016, due to heavy price 
competition and increasing A&P expense.

Entering a new undersupply cycle 
We expect raw milk supply to rebalance again from 2H17  
National raw milk price has recovered from RMB3.4 in 2Q to RMB3.5 in 3Q17. 
According to “cow” magazine’s survey, all of the 21 dairy farms in its survey 
either have the same or a higher price in October compared to September, and 
none of those farms limited production in October. We believe this is a result 
of capacity reduction from 2014.

What will happen in the new shortage cycle? 
Within the undersupply cycle, we expect a similar trend to the previous 
shortage cycle to happen in 2018-19:  
 
First, as large dairy players, Yili’s and Mengniu's sales growth will 
accelerate, driven by faster market share gains. This is because small 
brands’ raw milk sourcing capability is weaker in this cycle. Actually, 
Yili and Mengniu have shown such recovery from 2017 – Yili’s sales 
growth accelerated from 0.4% in 2016 to 14% sales growth in 9M17, 
and we expect Mengniu’s sales growth to accelerate to double-digit in 
3Q17. We forecast Mengniu/Yili’s sales to grow at 9%/11% in 2017-
19.  
 
Secondly, while gross margin will be under pressure due to rising raw 
milk price, most of this pressures could be passed on to consumers 
through reducing price discounts at an early stage, and raising prices 
at a later stage. For example, a Shanghai distributor indicated that Yili 
and Mengniu have raised the supply price of chilled yoghurt from 3Q.  
 
Thirdly, the selling expense ratio will decline on easing competition. 
Yili’s and Mengniu’s financial results in 9M17 also show this trend. 
Thanks to easing off of competition and lower SG&A expense, Yili’s 
and Mengniu's core operating margins expanded 120bps in 9M17 and 
190bps yoy in 1H17, respectively. We expect Mengniu/Yili’s core EBIT 
margins to expand by 400bps/260 bps from 2017 to 2019.

Mengniu: market underestimates its margin recovery 
potential; reiterating Buy 
We forecast the dairy sector to register an 8% sales CAGR in 2017-19, driven 
by 4% volume growth and 4% price increase each year. Further, helped by its 
stronger position in raw milk sourcing, we expect Mengniu’s market share to 
expand by 2-4% from 2017 to 2019.  
Meanwhile, we expect Mengniu to narrow its profitability gap with Yili, helped 
by recovering efficiency after the company’s organizational restructuring in 
2016 and improving IMF operations helped by industry recovery. (Refer to our 
note “Can Mengniu catch up with Yili?” for more details.) We forecast 
Mengniu’s recurring EBIT margin to expand from 6.1% in 1H17 to 7.0% in 
2019.  
We increase our earnings forecasts by 1-3% and expect a 31% recurring 
earnings CAGR in 2017-19. We raise our target price to HK$26.8 based on a 
DCF approach (factoring in 3.9% risk-free rate, 5.6% equity premium, 1.0 beta 
and 2% terminal growth). Our earnings forecasts are 1-6% higher than market 
consensus. In our view, the market is still underestimating the potential of its 
margin recovery. We reiterate Buy. The annual results announcement in March 
will be next catalyst.

Yili: well positioned in shortage cycle; reiterating Buy 
In the near term, we expect Yili’s market share in ambient/chilled products to 
expand from 34%/16% in 3Q17 to 38%/20%, respectively, in 2019, helped by its 
strong capability in raw milk sourcing. Meanwhile, we forecast its OP margin 
will expand from 11.5% in 9M17 to 12.2% in 2019, helped by easing 
competition and product mix upgrade.  
In the long term, we expect Yili to be an industry consolidator in the staples 
sector, helped by its stable and experienced management team, strong 
distribution network, and good track record in new product launches. We 
expect it to deliver secular growth through market share gains, category 
expansion, and M&A. 
We raise our earnings forecasts by 1-3% and forecast a 16% earnings CAGR in 
2017-19. We increase our target price to RMB35 based on a DCF approach 
(factoring in 3.9% RFR, 5.6% ERP, 1.0 beta, debt-free structure and 2% 
terminal growth). Downside risks: higher-than-expected raw material price 
increases, food safety incidents, and worse-than-expected competition.

discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company

the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
