Comments from Chairman Dong
On 9 December 2017, Gree’s chairman Mingzhu Dong was invited by the
China Entrepreneur Summit to give a speech on several topics, including Gree’s
automation strategy and 2017 performance:
■
The automation reform and diversification strategy are bearing fruits.
In her speech, Ms. Dong commented that Gree began to diversify
its businesses in recent years. In addition air-conditioning business, it
has entered into the ﬁeld of small appliances, smart manufacturing,
smart phones etc. Gree is undergoing automation reform. The company
considered using the domestic equipment before, but it ﬁnally chose the
imported German devices due to the higher precision. But as a long term
plan, Gree decided to enter into the ﬁeld of industrial manufacturing in
2013. Currently, Gree’s CNC machine, and robots are not only provided
for internal use, but also for other industries. Ms. Dong said that all of
the devices in Zhuhai Silver Dargon (a company invested by Ms Dong
privately) were produced by Gree.
■
Preview of 2017 results. According to Ms. Dong, Gree ‘s 2017-ytd
revenue increased RMB 40bn (2016 revenue: RMB108.3bn) as compared
with last year’s same period, and its NP margin was 15%.
Deutsche Bank view
With 2017 sales increased by RMB40bn, this implies 2017 total gross revenue
will reach RMB148bn, which beat DB's forecast and market consensus by 5%
and 4%, respectively. As for NP margin, her guidance is 0.3/0.8 ppt higher than
DB's forecast (14.7%) and market consensus (14.2%), respectively. Management
did not comment on Ms Dong's 2017 sales and NPM data.
Better product mix: an important positive in 2018 restocking that is not fully
priced in. Gree’s strong net margin could be driven by better product mix.
In our recent channel checks we noticed that distributors (starting from the
new air conditioner year) are focusing more on improving their product mix
than in previous years, clearing inventory to recover cash. This may drive better
proﬁtability for air conditioner brands (on top of strong volume growth which is
likely in the price). Proﬁtability expansion should be universal, as Midea previously
indicated that its core brand gross margin has improved by 2-3ppt YoY during

herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the
majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does
not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an
oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
