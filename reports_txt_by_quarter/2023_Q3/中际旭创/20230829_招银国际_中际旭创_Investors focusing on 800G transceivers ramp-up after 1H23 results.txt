Innolight (300308 CH) 
 
 
 
Investors focusing on 800G transceivers ramp-up 
after 1H23 results 
 
Innolight released 1H23 results. Total revenue was RMB4,004mn (-5.4% YoY), 
mixed impacts from increasing demand for AI-related transceivers and 
deteriorated demand for traditional datacenter products. NP was RMB613.8mn 
(24.6% YoY), mainly driven by higher GPM and operating cost optimization. 
1H23 NP was close to the mid-point of the preliminary range. Maintain HOLD, 
with unchanged TP at RMB104. 
 AI-related transceivers have offset non-AI transceivers. Company’s 
2Q23 revenue showed sequential growth (17.9% QoQ) primarily attributed 
to heightened shipment of 800G transceivers. However, total revenue fell 
slightly in 1H23, as the Company pointed out that the demand for 
200G/400G transceivers from datacenter was declining. This trend aligns 
with our previous expectations that AI investment will likely 
cannibalize certain traditional server expenditures and negatively affect 
sales of non-AI high speed transceivers. (link) 
 Margins stand out particularly. GPM expanded to 31.1% in 2Q23 vs. 
29.5%/29.3% in 1Q23/2022. NPM also increased to 16.8% in 2Q23 vs. 
13.6%/12.7% in 1Q23/2022. The increase is mainly due to decrease in 
procurement costs and favorable product mix driven by increasing 800G 
products shipment.  
 Maintain HOLD, with unchanged TP at RMB104. We lowered 2023-25E 
revenue forecasts by 6%-11%, as non-AI weakness is greater than our 
previous expectations. 2023-25E GPM was adjusted to 30.5%-31.7%, 
reflecting favourable product mix as the Company is expected to deliver 
more high data rate transceivers that have higher margins. The net impacts 
from lower sales and higher GPM left NP almost unchanged. 1H23 total 
revenue/NP now accounted for 39%/42% of our full-year estimates. 
 Potential upside/downside: We believe investors are closely monitoring 
the scaling up of 800G transceiver capacity and the Company’s ability to 
sustain the current performance, i.e., sequential sales growth and 
continuing margin expansion. Meanwhile, the deteriorated demand of 
200G/400G transceivers for datacenter should be on investors’ radar. While 
we regard Innolight’s optical transceivers business positively, we believe the 
current valuation is full.
