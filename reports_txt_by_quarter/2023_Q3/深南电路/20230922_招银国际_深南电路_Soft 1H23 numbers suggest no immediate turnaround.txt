Shennan Circuit (002916 CH) 
 
 
 
Soft 1H23 numbers suggest no immediate 
turnaround  
HOLD (Maintain) 
The worldwide PCB market experienced a significant decline of 20% YoY 
in 1H23, mainly due to falling demand for electronics products under global 
macroeconomic pressure. This is in line with our previous prediction that “we 
expect the global PCB market will persistently encounter macroeconomic 
challenges due to weakened consumer demand and the ongoing destocking 
cycle among downstream industries.” (link) Shennan Circuit (002916 CH), a 
pure PCB manufacturer, is not immune to the market weakness. Maintain 
HOLD, with lowered TP of RMB72. 
 PCB segment (nearly 2/3 of total revenue) remains weak, with margin 
erosion in a declining market. Segment revenue dropped by 12.4% YoY 
and 11.6% QoQ to RMB3.9bn in 1H23. The gross margin declined by 
1.49ppts to 25.9% compared to 1H22. Weakening demand in domestic and 
overseas telecom markets and delay in upgrade for Eagle stream platform 
dragged the segment sales. The contribution of the Company’s AI server 
related PCB products was not meaningful, suggesting Shennan is not yet a 
key beneficiary from the current AI boom. Auto PCB was the only spotlight, 
with 40% YoY growth in orders due to a low base.  
 Substrate segment was dealt a heavy blow with a significant 39.9% YoY 
drop in revenue, as downstream manufacturers continued destocking. 
Although the Company actively ventured into new projects and cultivated 
new customer relationships, ASP erosion was particularly severe for 
package substrate. GPM was 18.8% in 1H23 vs. 30.3% and 23.1% in 
1H22/2H22, affected by market down cycle and rising costs of new factories.  
 The Company reported a 13.5% YoY decline in revenue to RMB6.0bn and 
a substantial 37.02% YoY drop in net profit to RMB474mn in 1H23. GPM 
was lowered to 22.9% vs. 26.5% and 24.6% in 1H22/2H22. The Company’s 
1H23 results were below our estimates, which were already lower than 
consensus. We cut FY23/24E revenue and NP by 14%/14% and 29%/24%, 
as we think the business will continue to be affected by industry downcycle 
and a near-term turnaround may not be imminent. Maintain HOLD, with 
lowered TP of RMB72, based on 25x rollover 2024E P/E. We keep the 
same P/E multiple of 25x, which is over 1SD below 5-year historical avg., as 
the market is waiting for a clear sign of demand recovery.
