CTGR Group (600905 CH) 
 
 
 
Sound business operation; rising depreciation 
drags on earnings 
 
CTGR Group announced its 1H23 results, with in-line business operation but 
operating cost missing expectations. CTGR achieved revenue of RMB13.70bn, up 
by 12.98% YoY. Attributable NP was RMB4.52bn, dropped by 10.10% YoY. Although 
CTGR reported solid operation in electricity generation and slightly beat on-grid tariff, 
the increase in costs and operating expenses (under updated accounting standards) 
led to a drop in earnings. We believe CTGR will grow rapidly since its abundant 
projects under construction are about to operate in 2H23 and following years, and 
lower new energy upstream costs will lead to higher IRR of the projects.  We 
adjusted our TP to RMB6.24 and maintained a BUY rating. 
 Robust operational performance drives 1H23 revenue growth; rising
operating costs erode overall earnings. In 1H23, CTGR’s revenue was up by 
12.98% YoY due to resilient power generation growth. Attributable NP dropped by 
10% YoY. Its operating cash flow rose 21.79% YoY. CTGR’s revenue rose while 
attributable NP slipped due to: 1) 14.55% YoY rise in on-grid power generation; 2) 
slightly beat on-grid tariff for wind/solar power of RMB0.496/0.506 /kWh; 3) 34.67%
YoY increase in operating costs thanks to higher depreciation under accounting 
standard change (the depreciation of project operation costs accrue as the units 
enter operation in 2023 after a trial run in 2022) and higher management  fee; and 
4) 1.6% YoY rise in management expenses, while investment earnings descended 
by RMB0.27bn. 
 CTGR has abundant projects in construction and approved, with expected
promising growth. In 1H23, CTGR recorded a newly-added new energy installed 
capacity of approximately 1.8GW (0.84/0.65GW of wind/solar power). Moreover, 
CTGR recorded an approved and filed project capacity of 5.5 GW, and the planned 
installed capacity of projects under construction totalled 13.2 GW. With the projects
gradually commencing by 2H23 and next year, CTGR’s installed capacity of new 
energy is expected to speed up. Meanwhile, CTGR’s IRR of newly-added power 
plant projects will potentially climb due to lower upstream costs, benefiting CTGR’s 
earnings. 
 We adjusted our TP to RMB6.24, maintained BUY. Considering accounting 
standard adjustment, we slightly raised our estimated operating cost to
RMB12,219/14,344/16,371mn in FY23-25E, and adjusted attributable NP to
RMB8,932/10,534/12,956mn in FY23-25E. However, we maintained our key 
assumptions unchanged and stayed optimistic about CTGR thanks to its solid 
growth of power generation and steady on-grid tariff, and several projects are about 
to start operation. Thus, we raised our target FY23E PE from18x to 20x (close to 
3-year hist. avg.PE of 19x) for its sound business outlook, and we adjusted our TP 
to RMB6.24. Maintain BUY.
