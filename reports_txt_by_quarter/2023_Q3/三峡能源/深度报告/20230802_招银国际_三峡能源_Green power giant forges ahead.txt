CTGR's predecessor was the China Water Resources Development Corporation(中国水利
实业开发总公司) , which was established in 1985 and focused on the development of water 
conservancy and hydropower projects as well as urban water supply projects.  
 
In 1999, CTGR entered the business of new energy by participating in the shareholding of 
Goldwind (a wind turbine manufacturer), and in 2005, it entered the development, 
investment, and operation of wind farms. In 2008, CTGR was restructured and merged into 
CTG as its wholly-owned subsidiary, responsible for the development and operation of the 
Three Gorges Group's new energy business. Since then, the Company has continued to 
explore the field of new energy, with the commissioning of its first solar project in 2011 and 
first offshore wind project in 2016. In 2018-2021, CTGR completed the three-step strategy 
of "introducing strategic investors, stock reform, and listing," entering a new stage of 
development.  
 
In 2021, CTGR was listed on the SSE main board with one of the largest IPO in China's 
power industry in history.

Industry Analysis 
 
National energy policy targets to support the future high-speed growth of the 
wind power and solar power generation industry 
 
In 2022, China's cumulative installed wind power capacity reached 37GW, with a CAGR of 
16.17% from 2016 to 2022. The wind and solar power installation plans for different regions 
in China during the 14th Five-Year Plan period are clear. We estimate China's wind power 
installed capacity to reach 620mn kW by 2025, with a CAGR of 17% from 2021 to 2025.  
 
Figure 13: Newly-added wind power and solar power installed capacity in China 
(2018-25E) 
  
Source: NBS, NEA, CMBIGM estimates 
 
According to the data of Wind Daily and NEA, in 2022, wind power bidding exceeded 
103.27 GW in China, and newly-added installed capacity of wind power achieved 37 GW.

Most of the bidding capacity are expected to be grid-connected in 2023, resulting in an 
estimated 67 GW of newly-added installed capacity and an increase of around 81% YoY. 
Thus, in 2023, we predict the cumulative installed wind power capacity to be around 432 
GW in China. Additionally, the newly-added installed wind power capacity in 2024 and 2025 
will be up by 15% YoY and reach 77 GW and 89 GW respectively, with a predicted 
cumulative installed wind power capacity of 509 GW and 598 GW, maintaining around 20% 
YoY growth each year. 
 
Figure 14: Accumulated power installed capacity in China (2018-25E)  
  
Source: NBS, NEA, CMBIGM estimates 
 
For solar power, China's solar power installed capacity was 392 GW in 2022, and the solar 
bidding capacity for 2022 was about 155 GW. Based on the views of CPIA, China's 
conservative prediction for newly-added installed capacity of solar power in 2023 will be 
95GW, and the optimistic prediction will be 120 GW. Meanwhile, according to data from the 
NEA, the newly-added installed capacity of solar power in 1Q23 was 33.66 GW, up by 
154.81% YoY. As of Apr 2023, domestic PV component bids have exceeded approximately 
82 GW.  
 
Thus, we are positive that the newly-added installed capacity of solar power in 2023 may 
reach 120 GW, with a total accumulative installed capacity of 513 GW for the year.  
Additionally, solar power will continue to maintain high growth in 2024 and 2025, and we 
estimate cumulative solar power installed capacity will reach 652 GW and 811 GW. 
By 2025, the cumulative installed capacity of wind and solar power will reach 1,409 GW, 
exceeding the national 14th Five-Year Plan target of 1,200 GW.

optimization of wind farm layout and design, including site selection, wind farm layout, wind 
farm integration, and multi-energy complementarity. 
 
 
Policy support for the solar power industry and energy storage 
 
The solar power industry has also received policy support, and policy dividends will drive 
rapid development of the solar market. In recent years, the National Energy Administration 
issued a notice on solar power generation development, proposing a series of policy 
measures, including increasing support for photovoltaic poverty alleviation, promoting the 
construction of solar power+ energy storage projects, and accelerating the construction of 
photovoltaic poverty alleviation demonstration power stations, providing strong policy 
guarantees for the development of the solar power industry. 
 
Overall, the new energy power generation industry in China is in a phase of rapid 
development, with abundant resource reserves, strong policy support, continuous 
technological improvement, and broad market prospects.  
 
In the future, wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation will continue to be 
the main forms of new energy power generation. At the same time, to better promote the 
development of new energy power generation, it is also necessary to strengthen grid 
construction and research on energy storage technologies, and improve the consumption 
capacity and stability of new energy power generation. 
 
Abundant project reserves to support continue growth in 
CTGR’s electricity generation 
CTGR has a large projects reserve and plans to increase wind and solar power by at least 
5mn kW annually during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period. The Company aims to achieve

We compared the main layouts of electricity operators in the new energy sector under the 
latest “Big Five and Small Noble 4” power generation groups. Based on the data of 2022, 
we found that CTGR has several outstanding advantages as follows: 
 
1) In 2022, CTGR's photovoltaic installed capacity was the highest among the 
listed peers of “Big Five and Small Noble 4” power generation groups. In the 
future, CTGR will continue to focus on developing photovoltaic installations. 
 
The target for the newly-added photovoltaic and wind power installed capacity of CTGR in 
2023 is 5,000 MW. Photovoltaic installed capacity will make up the majority of this target, 
with a planned ratio of around 6:4 between photovoltaic and wind power. Additionally, the 
upstream cost of the photovoltaic industry chain has decreased, which has partially 
reduced construction costs and helped to improve the overall IRR of photovoltaic projects. 
Therefore, the company's willingness to invest in photovoltaic installations will up, enabling 
it to achieve or even exceed the photovoltaic installed capacity targets. 
 
Due to longer procurement cycles, the installations in 1H23 were delayed. It is expected 
that new energy installation will accelerate in the 2H23. 
 
2)  In 2022, CTGR's power generation increased significantly, which was due to 
the increase in wind and solar power installations and higher-than-national-
average utilization hours. 
 
In 2022, CTGR's power generation increased by 46.2% YoY to 48.35mn MWh, which was 
the highest among the peers we listed. The company's power generation in 1H23 is 
relatively optimistic. In Jun 2023, CTGR’s power generation had increased by 14.71% to 
28.09bn kWh. From Jan to May, power generation and utilization hours were slightly higher 
than the national average. With the improvement of wind resources, it is expected that wind 
power generation will continue to improve.

3)  In 2022, CTGR's revenue increased by 45%YoY, and its net profit attributable 
to shareholders ranked among the top listed peers of the new energy 
electricity operators. 
 
CTGR's revenue increased by 45% YoY in 2022, and its net profit attributable to parent 
company was up by 11.07% to RMB 7.155bn. The company's results growth was mainly 
due to the commissioning of new projects, an increase in total installed capacity, and an 
upward in power generation and grid-connected electricity.  
 
In particular, CTGR's revenue growth rate was among the highest of comparable 
companies. Although CTGR’s gross profit margin and net margin decreased slightly in 2022, 
but the data maintained a leading position among comparable companies. The net profit 
attributable to shareholders was also among the highest among listed peers, which was 
mainly attributed to the company's good cost control capabilities, technological progress, 
and excellent resource acquisition capabilities. 
 
Additionally, we believe that the company can maintain outstanding revenue and net profit, 
as well as good gross profit margin and net margin. The related growth can be driven by :1) 
CTGR's clear target for new installations in 2023; 2)sufficient approved and reserved 
projects; 3) a significant decrease in upstream costs for photovoltaics and wind power; 4) 
a great incentive scheme; 
 
4) CTGR's installation progress in 1H23 was slightly slower and its stock price 
has been stagnant, with its valuation partially falling. We expect its new 
energy installations to accelerate in 2H23, and the stock price to rebound.  
 
In 2022, CTGR recorded a P/E of 21.7x and a P/B of 1.9x. Its overall valuation was slightly 
higher than its peers, and its EPS were lower than those of leading new energy companies 
such as China Longyuan and Huaneng Renewables. Therefore, we regard CTGR’s profit 
and valuation attractiveness as still need to be improved. According to the company's 
announcement of Jun 2023, CTGR's progress in 1H23 is slightly slower, and its stock price 
has been stagnant, with its valuation partially falling. We expect installations to accelerate 
in 2H23, and the stock price to rebound. 
 
5) CTGR is a leader in offshore wind power generation, with advanced 
technology and stable future development. 
 
As one of the earliest central enterprises to develop offshore wind power in China, the 
CTGR has nearly 5mn kW of offshore wind power capacity that is already connected to the 
grid, ranking first in China. The large-scale development of offshore wind power is a 
strategic focus for the company, with advanced technology and experience in this field. 
 
In addition, CTGR has a number of offshore wind power projects in the pipeline and has 
received support from the government for the development of offshore wind power. We 
believe that CTGR's leadership in offshore wind power generation will be beneficial to its 
long-term development. 
 
Lower upstream costs lead to higher IRR of the wind farm 
project and solar power project, prompting CTGR’s 
investment willingness  
 
The wind power industry in China has entered the Grid Parity Era since 2021, leading to a 
reduction in upstream costs and a decline in wind turbine prices. According to Wind Power 
Headlines, the highest price for onshore wind turbines reached RMB4,200/kW in mid-2020 
and fell to the lowest at RMB1,150/kW in Feb 2023, dropping by -73%. Therefore, lower 
upstream costs have resulted in an increase in the IRR of wind power projects, making 
more projects suitable for investment by CTGR. As a result, CTGR is expected to show a

higher willingness to invest in wind power installation in 2023.

Figure 20: Onshore wind power tariff policies 
  
Source: NDRC, CMBIGM estimates 
 
The optimization of the industrial chain in the wind power sector reduces cost and increases 
efficiency, which drives the long-term growth in IRR of the onshore wind power project. For 
example, if the average tariff (incl-tax) for the project is RMB0.45/kWh, the construction 
cost of a 100MW onshore wind power project falls from RMB4,500/kWh to RMB4,000/kWh, 
the IRR of the project will increase from 11% to 14.3%. Additionally, if the construction cost 
decreases further to RMB3,800/kWh, the IRR will increase to 15.5%.

Source: CMBIGM estimates  
*Assuming utilization hours of 2000 
 
As the IRR for wind farm projects increases thanks to lower upstream costs, more projects 
will meet CTGR's investment criteria IRR. Therefore, a higher IRR of the wind power project 
is likely to boost CTGR Power’s investment willingness in newly-added wind power 
installations. 
 
For solar farm, given the upstream cost continues to drop, we believe the IRR of wind farm 
projects will further boost. Recently, the lowest reported price for solar module components

reached a historical low of RMB1.18/W, according to the latest group procurement. In light 
of CTGR's focus on increasing photovoltaic installed capacity in 2023, we believe the 
company can easily achieve and exceed its new energy’s newly-added installed capacity 
targets for 2023. As a result, the new project's IRR of CTGR is expected to further increase. 
 
Figure 22: Sensitivity analysis of IRR (solar power project) 
  
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates  
 
Lower upstream costs in the short to medium term are expected to benefit the IRR of new 
energy projects of CTGR. Continuous technological progress may also create opportunities 
for IRR improvement. Otherwise, changes in the non-technical costs of local governments 
will need to be monitored to comprehensively measure project’s IRR as well.  
 
Additionally, CTGR’s accelerated deployment of wind and solar power installed capacity, 
as well as active deployment of energy storage, is expected to benefit the stability of wind 
and photovoltaic power generation. However, configuring energy storage may increase 
construction costs and put some pressure on the project's IRR. Therefore, overall changes 
in IRR should be considered comprehensively. 
 
 
The improvement of power generation and average utilization hours 
 
Due to the rapid increase in wind power and solar installed capacity, China's wind power 
and solar power generation have grown significantly. The average utilization hours of grid-
connected wind and solar power equipment showed an overall upward trend, mainly due 
to the significant improvement in the wind and solar power curtailment rate.

to the present: benchmark pricing (2009-2018), guided pricing (2019-2020), and grid-parity 
pricing (2021 onwards). During the benchmark pricing stage, new energy projects received 
a fixed electricity price with excess payments above the local coal benchmark price as 
subsidies. During the guided pricing stage, on-grid electricity prices were determined by 
market competition but could not exceed the guided price in the resource area.  
 
Since 2021, wind and photovoltaic projects in China have been enter the cusp of grid parity, 
with the on-grid electricity price set according to the local coal benchmark price. The on-
grid tariff of onshore wind power and solar power tend to be rebound and stable in 2023.  
 
For offshore wind power, the Chinese government has announced the gradual cancellation 
of national subsidies for offshore wind power and the implementation of local subsidies, 
promoting healthy development and competitiveness of the industry. Although it presents 
challenges, the policy provides opportunities for the industry, and offshore wind power is 
expected to gradually achieve grid parity in the future.

Grid parity lowers overall electricity prices in 2021, while the tariff tend to be stable 
in 2023 as CTGR’s mgmt.’s guidance 
 
The downslope in subsidies and the promotion of grid-parity pricing have led to a general 
decline in the CTGR's tariff, particularly in solar power. From 2017 to 2022, the Company's 
integrated average on-grid tariff had a CAGR of -1.9%. Among them, wind power had an 
average CAGR of 2.68%, photovoltaic power had an average CAGR of -9.15%, and 
hydropower had a flat average CAGR. 
 
In 2022, CTGR's overall on-grid electricity price (ex-taxes) reached RMB0.5/kWh, an 
increase of 0.54%YoY (based on FY22 financial report adjustment from RMB0.4705/W in 
FY21 financial report to RMB0.4994/W). Wind power increased by 12.6% YoY to RMB0.51 
/kWh, photovoltaic power decreased by 6.6% YoY to RMB0.50 /kWh, and hydropower 
increased by 15.4% YoY on average. 
Figure 27: CTGR’s tariff (2017-2022) 
 
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates 
 
In 2022, CTGR participated in market-oriented electricity transactions in 19 provinces and 
regions, with a trading volume of 19.087bn kWh, accounting for 40.58% of the on-grid 
electricity transaction volume. The proportion of market electricity sales has increased and 
is expected to continue to rise.

oriented transaction prices with some discount compared to the approved tariff. However, 
with the increase of grid parity projects and the emergence of a tight supply-demand 
balance in electricity, the discount on tariff has gradually decreased over the years.  
 
Assuming a grid-connected electricity price of RMB0.45/kWh (based on the national 
benchmark coal-fired electricity price) for new grid-parity projects, we estimate the CTGR 
realized tariff to be RMB0.514, RMB0.501, and RMB0.484 /kWh from 2023 to 2025 
 
In 2022, CTGR actively participated in carbon reduction asset, green energy, and green 
certificate trading, locking in an additional revenue of over RMB280mn. CTGR signed its 
first ten-year green energy trading agreement as well. We believe that the scale of green 
energy trading will continue to expand, bringing potential performance growth from the 
green energy premium.

 
Expected improved progress in subsidy disbursement 
CTGR’s new energy subsidy funds mainly come from special funds and the China central 
treasury, with low possibility of being unable to recover. However, the accumulation of 
subsidies may pressure the Company's cash flow. If the subsidy receipts accelerate, it will 
benefit the Company's financial expense savings and new installed capacity investment.  
 
 
 
Incentive mechanism flexibility is expected to enhance business expansion 
enthusiasm and attention to market value management 
CTGR granted restricted shares at a discount to incentive objects in 2021, with a 
performance assessment requirement of achieving a revenue CAGR of at least 15.0%, 
16.5%, and 18.0% from 2022 to 2024. While the equity incentive will increase management 
expenses, it is expected to enhance business expansion and market value management.

(I) Offshore Wind Power 
 
The Company firmly implements the "Offshore Wind Power Leader" strategy, vigorously 
promotes preliminary work in Guangdong, Fujian, Jiangsu, Liaoning, Shandong, and other 
places, and constantly consolidates the advantages of large-scale development of offshore 
wind power. 
 
In 2022, the Company persisted in playing its differentiation advantages, and added 
2.15mn kW of offshore wind power resources. Shanghai, Hainan, and Tianjin successively 
achieved "zero" breakthrough, and the coastal area layout covered a wider area. By 2022, 
CTGR’s offshore wind power grid-connected installed capacity totaled 4,875,200kW. The 
first marine ranch and integrated demonstration project of parity offshore wind power in 
Shandong, the Changyi project (300,000kW), achieved full capacity grid connection within 
six months of going offshore, and the Muping offshore wind power project in Shandong 
(300,000kW) started construction.

(II) Onshore Wind Power 
 
CTGR is promoting onshore wind power development, focusing on ultra-high-voltage 
transmission and large-scale projects. The Company has onshore wind power projects in 
25 provinces, including the largest project in China and Asia in Inner Mongolia. The 
Company completed the first megawatt-level wind power project at high altitude in 
Xitieshan, Qinghai, and the Qingshui Baituo wind farm in Gansu supports clean energy and 
poverty alleviation. 
 
(III) Solar Power

Financial analysis and valuation 
 
 
Better proportion of new energy subsidies to account receivable, expected 
further subsidies return will improve company’s profit 
 
CTGR provisions impairment of renewable energy subsidies under conservative 
assumptions, which affects current profit. Accounts receivable for new energy subsidies 
accounts for 92.8% of the total, which show slight improvement. The Company has set 
aside RMB 560mn in bad debt reserves for subsidy receivables, which may increase the 
Company's net profit and operating cash flow if the subsidies are returned and the bad debt 
provision is less than the book balance of the reserve.

Profit forecast key assumptions 
 
 
(1) Installed capacity: According to the company's guidance, it is expected that the 
annual wind and solar power installed capacity will increase by no less than 5mn kW 
during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period. Based on the projects of the under-
construction and approved. We expect that the total installed capacity in 2023-2025 
will reach 31,421MW, 37,421MW, and 44,221mn kW, respectively.

(2) Utilization hours: Wind and solar resources are easily affected by climatic conditions. 
We assume that the utilization hours of onshore wind, photovoltaic, and hydropower 
for the CTGR will be 2,065, 1,348, and 4,250 hours in 2023. We assume that the 
utilization hours of onshore wind power will increase by 1% YoY in 2024, the 
utilization hours of photovoltaic will up by 3% YoY, and the utilization hours of 
hydropower will remain unchanged. 
 
(3) Tariff: We calculate the wind and solar power grid tariff for the Company in 2023-
2025 based on the weighted average price of subsidies and trading prices. We 
assume that the subsidy policies for wind and solar power will remain stable during 
the forecast period, and the proportion of subsidies in the grid price will gradually 
decrease. Overall, we assume that the market electricity prices will remain stable 
compared with last year. 
 
(4) Cost of generation: We assume that the cost of wind and solar power generation 
for the Company will continue to decrease due to technological advancement and 
lower upstream costs. For 2023, we estimate that the cost of wind power generation 
will decrease by 4% YoY, and the cost of solar power generation will decrease by 6% 
YoY. 
 
(5) Revenue growth: We assume that the Company's revenue CAGR will reach 16.8% 
during the forecast period, driven by the continuous expansion of installed capacity 
and the improvement of grid parity.

Figure 32: Key assumption table 
 
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates 
 
We estimate CTGR’s net profit attributable to shareholders to be RMB9.7bn, RMB11.79bn, 
and RMB14.44bn in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively, with EPS of RMB0.34, RMB0.41, 
and RMB0.50/share.  
 
Currently, CTGR is trading at 17x FY23E PE, which was lower than its peer China 
Longyuan (001289 CH) 22x FY23E PE.  For CTGR, its valuation was 22.59x for FY22 PE. 
Thus, we regard CTGR’s valuation should be re-rated and close to its peer China 
Longyuan’s valuation as they both are  the leading new energy operators with strong 
background of state-owned parent company and solid new energy installed capacity.   
 
For CTGR, it has the growth potential in 2023 as follows: 1) speed up new energy 
installation as the higher IRR of the projects with lower upstream cost, as we estimated 
solar power newly-added capacity will up by 60%YoY to 3000MW and wind power newly-
added installed capacity will up by 21%YoY to 2000MW in 2023; 2) robust on-grid tariff 
management capability and active green power trading enable CTGR to stabilize its overall 
on-grid tariff and we expected the on-grid tariff of 2023 will reach RMB0.5/W; 3) we also 
predicted further lower upstream cost to boost the GPM from 58% in 2022 to 59%,59%,60% 
in 2023-25E; 4)continually stable and attractive dividend payout ratio;

Summing up, we assign CTGR with an FY23 target PE of 20x, which close to the 
valuation of China Longyuan(001289 CH) 22x for FY23E, and arrive at the target price 
of RMB 6.79/ share. Initiate with BUY rating.
