Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH) 
 
 
 
2Q23 earnings +24%; Gross margin below 
expectations but likely rebounds  
 
Hengli’s net profit in 2Q23 grew 24% YoY to RMB653mn, with growth 
accelerated from 18% in 1Q23. That said, we do not see this as high quality 
growth as it was largely driven by FX gain that offset a surprisingly decline in 
gross margin (-4 ppt YoY). While the overall hydraulic components demand 
remained weak in Jul and Aug, we expect the gross margin to recover from 2Q 
as we understand that Hengli reduced the discount offered to customers. We 
trim our earnings forecast in 2023E/24E by 8%/9% on lower volume and gross 
margin. Our TP is revised down to RMB83, based on unchanged 42x 2023E 
P/E (1SD above the 4-year average of 30x to reflect the acceleration of earnings 
growth). We continue to like Hengli as we expect the commencement of 
hydraulic components production base in Mexico to help speed up the 
penetration in the US market. Besides, the expansion in ball screw (a key 
component of robots) will serve as a new growth driver.     
 Earnings growth in 2Q23 driven by largely by fx gain. Revenue in 2Q23 
grew 20% YoY to RMB2bn, accelerated from 10% in 1Q23 due to low base 
effect. Gross margin, to our surprise, contracted 4ppt YoY and 4.1ppt HoH 
to 36.8%, due to more discounts offered to customers. This resulted in 2.5% 
YoY decline in EBIT. Helped by the depreciation of RMB, net finance income 
grew 60% YoY to RMB292mn. Net profit therefore grew 24% YoY to 
RMB653mn.  
 Key highlights in 1H23 results. Sales volume hydraulic cylinder (for 
excavator) increased 1% YoY to 322k units. Sales volume of non-excavator 
cylinder grew 18% YoY to 114k units, driven by marine, AWP and industrial 
applications. Total revenue/net profit in 1H23 grew 14%/21% YoY to 
RMB4.45bn/1.28bn. Operating cash inflow slightly dropped 5% YoY to 
RMB991mn.  
 On-track development of ball screw product. A ball screw is a 
mechanical linear actuator that translates rotational motion to linear motion 
with little friction. Ball screws can be used to drive changes in the vertical 
and horizontal orientation of robot arms. Hengli’s ball screw product is 
currently at the trial stage. The first batch production equipment is expected 
to be arrived in Sep. Upon a full commencement of phase 1 capacity, the 
annual output value is expected to be RMB400-500mn.      
 Risk factors: (1) further weakness in the demand for hydraulic components 
for excavators; (2) lack of recovery of gross margin

Valuation  
 
We maintain our BUY rating on Hengli with new TP of RMB83 (previously: RMB90), based 
on unchanged 42x 2023E P/E, equivalent to 1SD above the 4-year average of 30x. Our 
above-average P/E is to reflect the acceleration of earnings growth driven by the overseas 
expansion and new opportunities in robotic component (ball screw) segment.
