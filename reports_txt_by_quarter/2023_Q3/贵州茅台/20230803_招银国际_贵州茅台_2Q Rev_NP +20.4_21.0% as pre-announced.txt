Kweichou Moutai (600519 CH) 
 
 
 
2Q Rev/NP +20.4/21.0% as pre-announced 
 
Moutai announced 2Q results that matched with its pre-announcement, and we 
do not expect the numbers to be eventful to near term share price. While Moutai 
has been a laggard of the recent baijiu sector rally in response to a positive market 
takeaway from the recent politburo meeting, the company remains a solid 
defensive name which shields itself from any malignant price competition through 
its brand scarcity. Our recent channel check with distributors indicated that prices 
of sealed/unpacked Feitian Moutai steadied at RMB2,940/2,740 per bottle by 
end-July, largely unchanged from that we observed in early June, not to mention 
a healthy 15-day inventory level. Forward-looking into 3Q in which gifting season 
begins with the Mid-Autumn festival, we see every reason for Moutai to sustain 
its high-teen growth trajectory. We remain Buyer of Moutai. 
Key 2Q results takeaway 
 2Q revenue booked RMB31.6bn, up 20.4%, compared to 18.7% in 1Q 
and 19.0% in the pre-announcement. This was mainly driven by 21.0% 
growth in both Moutai and Series liquor sales. Assuming a high single 
digit volume growth, we attribute the predominant growth driver to ASP 
uplift. 2Q GPM stood at 91%.  
 Production wise, in our view, the growing Series spirit contribution should 
comprehend Moutai’s competitiveness in the entry high-end segment, 
while alleviating the growth bottleneck of Moutai spirit. 
 We believe 2H outlook is positive with relatively more gifting scenarios 
and increased corporate procurement needs along with further macro 
recovery. 
 Regarding innovative launches, subsequent to the debut of Moutai ice 
cream, the company migrated into the coffee segment with new attempts 
in Moutai Americano, Moutai Dirty, Moutai Latte, etc. The CEO 
mentioned that Moutai shall expand its product coverage with the aim of 
attracting younger customers.  
 
Earnings change/Valuation. We moderately adjust our forecasts on back of an 
in-line 2Q results. Our TP is still based on 41.0x end-23E P/E, which represents 
long-term average since 2019. Our methodology reflects our relative optimism 
(vis-a-vis other F&B diversified of which target multiples are based on -1sd below 
long term average) on Moutai that it is one of the core beneficiaries of China’s 
reopened 
economy 
with 
high 
certainty 
in 
earnings 
delivery.
