CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
 
Yili Industrial (600887 CH) 
 
 
 
Full-year guidance unchanged 
 
We hosted a NDR with Yili management to obtain follow-up post the company’s 
investor day on 14th Jul and 2Q operational update. Overall, Yili maintained its 
initial guidance of a HSD top line growth with a 0.3pp uptake in net margins for 
the year. On a sequential basis, 2Q sales has further accelerated from that of 
1Q. This consists of drivers such as QoQ improvement in UHT milk, especially 
that of high-end UHT milk, double-digit growth in adult formula, growth in low-
temp SKUs (despite a tough comp) and a stable cheese momentum over 2B 
channel. Separately, Yili reaffirmed that, albeit deflating raw material prices, 
gross margins will likely remain stable, when reasonable discounts to stimulate 
retail sales likely offset the savings. In other words, any improvement in 
profitability will be solely driven by operation cost savings. Concerning the 
remainder of the year, Yili remains upbeat and see scope for further recovery to 
take place, thanks to a high debut density from brands like Satine and 
Ambrosial. While we remain lukewarm on the dairy segment from a risk-reward 
perspective, we think Yili is a relative outperformer among its peers thanks to 
its operation scales, more frequent new launches and above-industry milk 
formula growth. We are buy-rated. 
 Raw material cost impact to GPM. Despite a small, or a LSD drop in raw 
milk costs, Yili expects a stable GPM for 2023E as the merit will likely be 
offset by a small increase in other material costs such as sugar, packaging 
materials, not to mention retail discounts. Mix upgrade will be the only driving 
force to boost GPM and financially we look for a 0.2-0.3pp hike over 2023-
25E. 
 Earnings assumptions/ changes. We largely maintain our 2023/24E 
estimates. For 2023E, we continue to assume 1) a 5.5%/ 20%/ 20% liquid 
milk/ low-temp dairy/ IMF sales growth YoY, respectively. These underpin a 
7.7% 3-year revenue CAGR between 2022-25E. Combined with the GPM 
assumptions above, our net margins for 2023-25E are set at 8.0%/ 8.3%/ 
8.7%. Overall our forecasts largely tally with management’s expectation on 
revenue/ pre-tax profits of RMB 135.5bn/RMB 12.5bn. We also introduced 
our 2025E forecasts. 
 Valuation. Our new TP is based on an updated 24.0x (from previously 
25.0x) end-23E PE, which still benchmarks to its 5-year average. Comparing 
to Mengniu (2319HK, Buy), which we value at -1sd below average, we 
assign a higher target multiple to Yili to reflects the latter’s stronger IMF 
business outlook in the near term.

Key takeaway from Yili’s investor day 
 
Satine (Premium room-temp milk): 
 
Premium milk products is experiencing high growth supported by data disclosed by 
Nielsen: market penetration is as high as 76%; when households average annual 
consumption volume stands at 14.6 L (or 5 packs). Single transaction exceeds RMB 
70. By 2027, Yili sees organic milk GMV to reach RMB 34.8bn. Domestic organic milk 
consumption currently takes up 20% of the global organic milk consumption, with 12% 
CAGR in the past 3-yr (the growth speed is 6 times of that of room temp milk). 
 
 
The brand continued on promoting premium organic product series, while adding the 
A2 series to start debut with competitive price. Yili sees the latter to be flagship series 
with potential RMB1bn sales.  
 
 
Ambrosial (UHT yogurt): 
 
Yogurt industry has seen a slowdown in growth over the past 3 yrs, with recent 6-mos 
shows trend of HoH improvement. Consumption preference grew to be polarized and 
there emerged various demands in regards to different aspects of health.  
 
 
The brand has devoted to introducing new products matching differentiated demands. 
For example, AMX, Ambrosial’s sugar-free product sub-brand, was introduced in 
2021. In April 2023, AMX products were upgraded and has been certified with Low 
GI. Within 52 days after its launch, sales surpassed RMB 200mn. 
 
 
Leveraging its technological breakthrough, the brand will introduce an innovative UHT 
product in Aug 2023 with active probiotic to meet consumer needs.  
 
 
In longer term, the brand plans on cross-category expansions, such as to step into 
fields of snacks and soft beverages. With its underlying gene of yogurt making, brand 
will create concepts like “healthy snacks, healthy bubble/carbonated drink”.  
 
 
Starting 19 July 2023, Ambrosial’s collaboration with McDonald’s Pineapple Yogurt 
McFlurry will be listed in 7,000+ McDonald’s stores nation-wide.  
 
 
Pro-Kido (IMF): 
 
The projected market sales should exceed RMB 140bn in 2023. Nielsen data 
suggested two major ongoing trends: ultra-premiumization and production-
localization. The sector is 60% ultra-premium products driven. These products 
nonetheless still maintained double digit growth. Domestic IMF brands market share 
has surpassed 60% and is growing at 25% YoY, which is 30 bps faster than those of 
foreign brands. 
 
 
The brand’s competitiveness lie in three aspects: 1) Zhangjie, the ambassador 
targeting female consumers of age range 20-35, 2) high reputation on Little Red Book 
and Douyin, with search rate on both platforms recording high growth, 3) leadership 
in the maternal and child care system, which conquered 65% of sales.

Xinhuo (Formula milk for Aged group): 
 
China’s aging population is accelerating, with population aged 50+ reaching 500mn 
or one-third of the total. The advancement of medical services aids further room of 
expansion. It is projected that 50+ age group population portion would grow to 41.6% 
in 2030. According to Nielsen data, formula milk consumption grew 11.4% YoY in 
1H23. In the period, retail asp increased 16% YoY. 
 


 
The high-end product line achieved a 40% growth in 1H23. The core product, sugar-
relieving dietary base formula, has achieved over 100% growth for two consecutive 
years, with no signs of slowdown. Its core competitiveness lies in being the industry's 
first product with a low GI. According to national regulations, a product with a GI below 
50 can be recognized as low GI. The two SKUs of sugar-relieving dietary base formula 
have GI indexes of 13.9 and 9, respectively. The product innovatively incorporates 
rare Chinese herbal ingredients, such as kudzu root and polygonatum, to achieve 
better blood sugar control. It is the first clinically tested blood sugar control product.

commerce has become a new purchasing channel.

ranges. In recent years, they have expanded portfolio with crispy cone products,
