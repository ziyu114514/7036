Diﬃcult market ahead, but debt-to-
equity swap plan holding up valuation
Core earnings break even; challenging market ahead but valuation holding up
We expect a challenging operating environment for QSLI, particularly for its
chemical integration project, which overhangs QSLI's performance. The company
showed signs of improvement in operations QoQ in 2Q17 and reached operational
breakeven; if we strip out one-oﬀ items (i.e., asset impairment), QSLI's core
earnings entered positive territory with a proﬁt of RMB23mn in 2Q17 vs. a loss of
RMB210mn in 1Q17, thanks to an improved transportation situation with higher
potash sales volume QoQ. 2H17 should see an improvement HoH, with higher
sales volume of potash/lithium, while the potential debt-to-equity swap may be
the next catalyst for the share price; however, shaky market conditions plus
diﬃcult ﬁnancials with higher DD&A charges could oﬀset the positives. We see a
balanced risk-reward proﬁle and keep our Hold rating and TP of RMB11.66/share.
Debt-to-equity swap plan to support share price; 1H17 net gearing at 114%
The potential restructuring of debt should support QSLI's valuation, with two
restructurings planned: 1) QSLI has proposed a debt-to-equity swap; and 2) a new
bond issuance. EBIT broke even at RMB174mn in 1H17, while operating cash ﬂow
was RMB401mn, down 27% YoY. We see limited balance sheet improvement,
with a net gearing of 114% in 1H17 (vs. 115% in 1H16/125% in FY16). On the other
hand, QSLI signed a debt-to-equity swap MOU with Qinghai SASAC and CCB,
forming a deleveraging fund of RMB20bn to facilitate the debt-to-equity swap
process. The details of the plan are still under negotiation. As per our analysis,
the debt-to-equity swap will likely be accretive for both ROE and EPS; under our
scenario 1, which uses our TP as an exercise price, FY18E ROE is enhanced by
+1.9%pts and EPS by +135% (see our analysis table for details).
Recap of 1H17 earnings: sluggish on both ends
QSLI posted 1H17 results on 30 August with a net loss of RMB523mn (EPS
of RMB-0.188/share), down 243% YoY and in line with the preliminary results
announcement. The sluggish 1H17 performance was mainly attributed to 1) asset
impairment of RMB448mn on urea/methanol/inventory; 2) a 25% YoY decline in
potash sales volume; 3) a 19% YoY dip in potash ASP; and 4) higher DD&A on
magnesium integration and Haina PVC projects. Stripping out the one-oﬀ items,
1H17 core net loss would have been RMB142mn vs. 1H16 core net proﬁt of
RMB347mn. Looking at the cash earnings, however, the EBITDA to net interest
expenses was 2.0x in 1H17, while net gearing stood at 114%.
■
Sluggish potash performance: the segment revenue declined 39% YoY
to RMB2.3bn, while GPM fell 7%pts YoY to 66%, due to 1) a 25% YoY

decline in sales volume (by 626kton) to 1,847kton, from 2,474kton in
1H16, attributed to delivery delays caused by transportation regulations
beginning 4Q16; and 2) a 19% YoY dip in potash ASP to RMB1,284/ton
(from RMB1,588/ton), excluding tax and transportation cost.
■
The worse-than-expected loss in the chemical segment was due to 1) a
higher DD&A charge on magnesium integration and Haina PVC projects
starting operations; 2) impairment provisions for inventory and urea and
methanol plants; and 3) a dip in the overall utilization rate to below
70%, inﬂuenced by an environmental inspection. This oﬀset the strong
performance in lithium, where revenue increased 4x to RMB172mn in
1H17 (despite a GPM of 59%). Looking ahead, QSLI expects to double
lithium carbonate production to c.4kton in 2H17.
Earnings, valuation and risks; maintaining Hold
We cut our FY17E/18E EPS to RMB-0.07/0.10, down RMB0.19/0.20 on asset
impairments, higher DD&A charges, and lower potash sales volume. However, we
keep our DCF-derived TP at RMB11.66 (assuming a 6.6% WACC and 2% terminal
growth), which implies 1.2x P/B in 17-18E; we believe the risks and rewards are
balanced at a current valuation of 1.2x 17E P/B vs 1.1% 17E ROE, supported by
a potentially ROE-/EPS-accretive debt-to-equity swap plan. Key downside risks:
1) sluggish chemical prices and soft demand could lead to lower product sales;
and 2) unfavorable government policy. Key upside risks: 1) better-than-expected
potash prices; and 2) faster-than-expected demand growth.

in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices

QSLI
Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.

Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
