We continue to view Luxshare (along with Sunway) as the top Buy in our China 
A-share coverage. It continues to deliver solid results and a positive outlook. 
Long term, it benefits from USB Type-C and fast-charging upgrades on mobile 
devices, which demand high quality cable/connectors. Some people are 
concerned that wireless power charging (WPC) will likely disrupt Luxshare’s 
core business (connectors/cables). However, Luxshare will likely benefit. First, 
wireline and wireless charging should co-exist for long time (given the gap in 
charging efficiency). Second, WPC requires a charging cable/pad (TX) and a 
receiving module (RX), for which Luxshare has a high market share. 
2Q17 beats expectation on strong GPM     
Luxshare reported 2Q17 EPS of RMB0.12 (+89% yoy; +26% qoq) on operating 
profits of RMB450m (+54% yoy; 24% qoq) on sales of TWD 4.4bn (+65% yoy; 
+12% qoq). EPS/operating profit beat our estimate by 14%/13%, with GPM up 
2.4ppt to 22.8% (vs our 20.5%), due to better product mix, capacity utilization 
and stabilized ASP trend (on i-device components). In terms of segment 
performance, mobile device components led, reporting 156% yoy growth 
(market share gain + iPhone audio adaptor) in 1H17, followed by automotive 
(+29% yoy), telecom equipment (+23%) and PC (-9% yoy).   
Promising 2H17 outlook, due to new iPhones and new components    
Luxshare expects 3Q17 net profit to reach RMB339-RMB475m (up 21% to 70% 
yoy). We expect Luxshare could achieve the high-end of its guidance, as we 
see multiple growth drivers ahead in 2H17, including: 1) a stronger new iPhone 
cycle (iPhone 8 with OLED, 3D sensing, WPC), 2) the addition of a wireless 
charging module (RX) and three-in-one (Wi-Fi/GPS/BT) antenna for new 
iPhones, 3) new Apple Watch (series 3) launch (Luxshare supplies the WPC 
pad) and 4) a rising penetration of USB Type-C and fast charging technologies 
on Android devices.  
Valuation and investment risks  
We revise our 2017-18E EPS by 7%/12% to reflect dollar content increase for 
the iPhone and market share gains in the telecom/auto. We raise our target 
price from RMB20 to RMB24, based on 30x 2018E EPS (from 30x 2017-18E 
average EPS). 30x PER represents 0.9x PEG (vs. regional peers of 0.8x PEG). 
We see the premium valuation as justifiable, given its improved sector growth 
outlook and long-term market share gain potential. Downside risks include: 
slow USB type-C proliferation, price competition and forex fluctuations.

Valuation and risks   
Retain Buy rating, with target price of RMB24  
We revise our 2017-18E EPS by 7%/12% to reflect dollar content increase for 
the iPhone and market share gains in the telecom/auto. We raise our target 
price from RMB20 to RMB24, based on 30x 2018E EPS (from 30x 2017-18E

taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication

or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company

the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
