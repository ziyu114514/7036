Passenger NEV – higher opex but nice
progress; reiterating Buy
IA ahead of expectations; passenger NEV has started to make progress
Inovance's 1H result (NP up 10% YoY) tracks behind our full-year estimates,
dragged by surging opex associated with the passenger NEV business. However,
underlying operations and management's comments at the analyst call brought
up two positive surprises: 1) stronger-than-expected IA growth in 1H and
sustainable 30-50% growth guided by management going forward, and 2) an
encouraging breakthrough in the passenger NEV business with 6-7 customers
secured in 1H. With continuing strength in IA, an NEV bus recovery, opex
normalization and rising contributions from passenger NEV and industrial robots,
we believe earnings growth is set to accelerate. We maintain Buy.
Strong 1H top-line growth partially oﬀset by margin contraction
1H net proﬁt of Rmb429m (+10% YoY) achieved 36% of our full-year estimate,
which tracks behind the 5-year average of 43%. GP margin contracted 3.3ppt to
45.8%, driven mainly by the new energy segment (down 18.2ppt YoY). This, along
with higher-than-expected opex (R&D expense +75% YoY and selling expense
+41% YoY), partially oﬀset strong top-line growth in 1H (+32% YoY). In 2Q alone,
sales growth moderated to 29% YoY from 38% YoY in 1Q, while NP growth visibly
slowed to 3% YoY (from 24% YoY in 1Q), largely due to surging opex.
Stronger-than-expected IA growth a key positive
Sales of general IA products (servos and inverters) soared 90%+ YoY in 1H, way
ahead of China’s overall market growth (15% for inverters and 23 % for servos
in 1H), management's full-year guidance (30-50%) and our full-year estimates
(50-60%). Inovance's "vertical-based" strategy continued to facilitate its market
gains in traditional verticals like textile machinery and air compressors.
GPM contracted while opex surged
GPM contraction was mainly because of 1) ASP cuts (10-20% by Yutong), low
sales volume and higher sales rebates in the NEV segment and 2) an unfavorable
product mix in the inverter segment (i.e. rising contributions from low-margin
auxillary elevator products and high-voltage inverters). The big jump in opex was
mainly due to a passenger NEV business expansion, with the R&D expense ratio
(as a percentage of sales) rising to a historical high of 14% in 1H. Such a surge,
however, is likely to be a one-time event as management expects the ratio to
normalize to 8-10% starting in 2018.
Guidance by segment is upbeat; encouraging breakthrough on new businesses

At Friday's post-result conference call, management gave an update of the
latest progress in new business development and provided guidance segment by
segment.
■
General IA products to sustain high growth: New order growth, albeit
slower on tougher comps, managed to sustain its high level in July
(50%+ YoY). Looking ahead, management expects its general inverter
and controller business to sustain 30%+ growth while general servo
sales keeps growing at a pace of 50%+, as Inovance views automation
upgrades as a secular growth driver of the segment.
■
NEV segment to be back on track in 2H: Despite headwinds from Yutong
in 1H, logistics NEV and non-Yutong NEV bus businesses were on track to
achieve the full-year target. New orders from Yutong in June and July have
already shown a visible recovery (a 50%+ YoY increase). Management
retains its full-year guidance of >30% for the segment (DBe: 30%).
■
Heavy investment in passenger NEV has started to show progress:
Being the ﬁrst local player to successfully roll out automated production
lines and obtain the ISO26262 certiﬁcation (the highest safety standard for
auto electronic systems) for the passenger NEV drive, Inovance managed
to secure 5-6 tier-2 passenger NEV customers to supply its controller
products and 1 customer for its powertrain products. Management is
conﬁdent that they can secure 1-2 tier-1 passenger NEV customers in
2H17 and expects the business to take oﬀ in 2019. In the longer term,
management expects third-party OEMs to take a bigger share of China's
passenger NEV powertrain market. Inovance is likely to stand out in terms
of cost competitiveness, technology and quality control.
■
Industrial robotics to emerge as a new growth driver in long term: In
1H, Inovance successfully expanded its robot product oﬀering. Its new
products are also massively being tested by customers in verticals like
mobile phone manufacturing and lithium batteries.
Maintaining Buy; risks
We cut our 2017 earnings estimate by 11% after modeling in stronger-than-
expected IA growth in 1H (lifting revenue by 3%) but more conservative opex
assumptions. We keep our 2018-19 forecasts largely unchanged and retain our
DCF-based target price of Rmb30.1 (WACC:8% and TGR: 2%). Key risks: slower-
than-expected NEV growth and an IA demand recovery.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
