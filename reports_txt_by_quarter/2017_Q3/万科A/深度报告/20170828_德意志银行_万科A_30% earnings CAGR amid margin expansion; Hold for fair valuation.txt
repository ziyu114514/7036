We lift FY17-19F earnings by 8-14% and raise our target price slightly to 
RMB25.51 after factoring in a better margin, 1H17 results and the latest land 
acquisitions. Given its RMB384bn unbooked sales with a higher post-tax gross 
margin (~26% vs. 20.9% in FY16), we expect it to deliver 30% earnings growth 
in FY17-18F, implying 4-6% dividend yields (highest among blue chips). 
However, we believe the current valuation is fair (7.2x FY18F P/E and 18% 
discount to NAV). Hence, we maintain our Hold rating. 
More land banking needed to sustain fast growth 
We expect Vanke to reach RMB535bn contracted sales this year (+47% yoy), 
given that it achieved RMB313bn sales by July, and there are ~40m sqm 
saleable GFA in 2H17. However, we believe its 116m sqm land bank is 
insufficient to sustain its high growth, and more land banking is needed in 
2H17. In addition to its 2.9m sqm (attributable GFA) of urban renewal projects, 
management disclosed that there are >40 railway property projects (distributed 
in several cities) under discussion to fuel its rapidly depleting land bank. 
30% earnings CAGR amid gross margin expansion; 5-7% dividend yield 
Due to higher ASP and better cost control under the partnership scheme, the 
post-tax gross margin of Vanke has significantly improved to 26.2% in 1H17 
(vs. 20.9% in FY16). We expect this will likely remain at similar level, and 
hence, support 30% earnings CAGR in FY17-18F (given its RMB384bn 
unbooked sales), implying a 5-8% dividend yield range on a 40% payout ratio. 
Strong growth in other businesses 
Besides its property development, Vanke also achieved strong growth in its 
other businesses: 1) property management service recorded RMB3bn revenue 
in 1H17 (+70% yoy), with ~400m sqm under management; 2) >8.5m sqm of 
commercial properties under management (including 34 malls with 4.9m sqm 
in operation); 3) 32 logistics properties (2.6m sqm) were acquired and another 
35 projects been contracted (2.5m sqm), as well as engaged in the potential 
privatization of GLP and 4) it obtained 70k units of long-lease apartments 
(including 20k units under operation with ~87% occupancy). 
Valuation and risks  
Our target price is based on 10% discount to end-2017F NAV of RMB28.35. 
The stock now trades at 7.2x FY18F P/E and at an 18% discount to NAV. Key 
downside risk: a failure to acquire quality sites to sustain growth. Upside risks 
are better-than-expected sales and margin expansion. See page 3 for more.

Investment Thesis 
Outlook 
We lift FY17-19F earnings by 8-14% and raise our target price slightly to 
RMB25.51, after factoring in a better margin, 1H17 results and the latest land 
acquisitions. Given its RMB384bn unbooked sales with higher post-tax gross 
margin (~26% vs. 20.9% in FY16), we expect it to deliver 30% earnings growth 
in FY17-18F, implying 4-6% dividend yields (highest among blue chips). 
However, we believe the current valuation is fair (7.2x FY18F P/E and 18% 
discount to NAV). Hence, we maintain our Hold rating. 
Valuation 
Our end-FY17F NAV estimate is comprised of RMB25.78/share development 
properties, HKD1.93/share of investment properties and HKD0.63/share of net 
cash. Our NAV estimate values existing land bank and properties based on a 
sum-of-the-parts methodology: 1) we use DCF to value the company's 
development properties, with WACC of 9.1% (we apply a risk-free rate of 
3.0%, beta of 1.4, risk premium of 6.0% and cost of debt at 5.7%) and 2) we 
use a cap-rate approach (cap rate between 5% and 9%) to value investment 
properties. In our model, we assume full prepayment of the land appreciation 
tax. In terms of property price assumptions, we assume prices will likely drop 
5% in T1 and T2 cities in 2017F and remain flat thereafter. For T3 cities, we 
assume 3% property price growth in 2017F and prices to remain flat thereafter. 
Our 12-month target price is based on a discount to our NAV estimate. The 
rationale for such target discount is based on eight key measures of the 
companies we cover (product quality, land bank quality, scale, leverage, 
growth prospect, profitability, financing advantage and execution). Comparing 
China Vanke to peers in terms of operating and financial performance, we 
apply a 10% discount to our NAV estimate. It implies 7.2x FY18F P/E (EPS: 
RMB3.20) and 1.7x FY17F P/B. The benchmark index for the stock is MSCI 
China. 
Risks 
Macro risks: Government property tightening measures might be stricter than 
expected, which could result in volatile moves in housing transaction volumes, 
housing prices, land prices and financing available to developers and 
homebuyers. The unexpected economic fluctuations in the Chinese economy 
also add risks to the sector. In addition, potential RMB depreciation may result 
in FX losses for developers with offshore financing. 
Company-specific risks: The downside risks include: 1) further management 
uncertainties due to the complicated shareholding structure and 2) failure in 
business diversification, leading to lower earnings growth and ROE recovery. 
An upside risk is a strong ASP improvement, leading to wider margin 
expansion.

financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank,

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside potential surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common 
adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. Yet, counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, 
regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
