1H17 weakness as guided; recovery
path still full of challenges
1H17 proﬁt in line with preliminary announcement; margins aﬀected by rising
costs
Great Wall Motor’s (GWM) 1H17 net proﬁt was marginally lower than its
preliminary proﬁt announced on 21 July. In brief, the company recorded a 1.0%
YoY gross revenue decline to RMB41.3bn on meager 0.7% YoY sales volume
growth and oﬀset by price promotion, according to the company. Moreover,
GWM’s 1H17 net proﬁt decreased by 50.9% YoY to RMB2.4bn with a signiﬁcant
6.2ppt decline in net proﬁt margins, due to 1) the aforementioned discounting,
2) higher marketing expenses and 3) higher R&D expenses, according to the
company’s announcement.
On a quarterly basis, GWM booked a 13.7% YoY decline (23.1% QoQ drop) in
2Q17 gross revenue, due to a 4.7% YoY decrease (18.7% QoQ decline) in vehicle
sales. Operating proﬁt margins plunged on a YoY and QoQ basis, probably due
to deep 2Q17 price cuts and upfront new product launch costs, in our view. On
the bottom line, the company reported a 81.6% YoY slump (76.2% QoQ decrease)
in 2Q17 net proﬁt.
Management still expects margins to recover on new models
GWM hosted a conference call on 25 August. The key takeaways are as follows:
■
Management maintains its full-year sales target of 1.25m units on higher
new Haval H6 sales and contribution from WEY brand, although they
acknowledge the challenges in attaining that target. Monthly sales of new
Haval H6 reached c.15k units in July, and the company expects sales
volume to pick up further.
■
Regarding the new WEY brand, management commented that the new
VV7 SUV is in short supply after launch, given strong demand. Great
Wall targets monthly sales of 10k units of VV7 and 15k units of VV5.
According to management, gross proﬁt margins for the two models are
likely to reach 20-25% after initial ramp-up. In addition, the company
targets increasing 4S dealership stores to c.100 by year-end, and by 200
by next year from the current c.40 stores.
Our price target is based on a target 7x
FY18E P/E (from 7x FY17/18E). Key upside
risks are stronger-than-expected new model
sales and a margin rebound (see page 2 for
details).
■
For 2H17, Great Wall plans to launch the WEY VV5 SUV, WEY VV7 plug-
in hybrid SUV, WEY brand hybrid SUV, new Haval H6 1.5T SUV and some

revamps of existing models, such as the Haval H6 Sporty and Haval H2
SUVs.
■
Despite higher labor, promotion and R&D cost base, GWM expects
margin trends to gradually improve in 2H17, with the sales ramp-up of
the newly-launched new generation Haval H6 and WEY VV7, as well as
the WEY VV5, which should achieve better-than-average margins after
ramp-up.
■
The third Xushui plant, with annual capacity of 200k units, began
operation in April of this year for the production of the new H6 and VV7
models, along with the to-be-launched VV5.
Deutsche Bank view – recovery pace unlikely to be strong amid competition
With competitors posing greater threat in various SUV price segments in which
GWM participates, we envision escalating costs for GWM in defending their
market position. Although GWM will attempt to regain SUV market share and
restore margins by oﬀering more models and the upscale WEY brand with
enhanced features, we believe ongoing price pressure and cost inﬂation in various
aspects amid competition, will cap the extent of earnings recovery, despite decent
initial demand for WEY products. Therefore, we maintain Sell ratings on GWM's
H shares and its A shares.
We lower our FY17-19 revenue and net proﬁt estimates by 2.6-8.3% and
8.4-14.7%, respectively, in consideration of GWM's weaker-than-expected sales
momentum and margin pressure on competition. We set our target price based on
7.0x FY18E P/E (rolled over from 7.0x FY17/18E P/E ), which is below Great Wall's
historical H-share trading average, considering a lack of long-term EPS growth.
We believe our target multiple is justiﬁed, given a FY16-19E three-year EPS CAGR
of -1%. Our target price also implies FY18E P/BV of 1.1x, which seems well
supported by a sustainable ROE of about 16-17%. Key upside risks are stronger-
than-expected new model sales and a margin rebound.

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.
Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. Analysts are
paid in part based on the proﬁtability of Deutsche Bank AG and its aﬃliates, which includes investment banking, trading
and principal trading revenues.
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no
less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to time discuss with
our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report
is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
