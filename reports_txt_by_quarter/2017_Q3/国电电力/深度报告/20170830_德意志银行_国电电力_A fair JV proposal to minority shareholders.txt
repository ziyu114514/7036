GD Power announced the proposal of formulating a JV with Shenhua by 
injecting thermal power assets from both companies. Meanwhile, the State 
Council also approved the merger between Guodian Group and Shenhua 
Group, parentco of the two listcos, into a newly named State Energy 
Investment Corporate, which will be the new parentco of both GD Power and 
Shenhua Energy. Based on preliminary terms disclosed, the terms look fair to 
GD Power’s minority shareholders and the merger of both parentcos should be 
strategically positive on the back of stronger vertical integration between coal 
and power and enhanced consolidation in the power sector. 
A fair multiple for GD Power’s thermal power assets 
Based on the terms disclosed, GD Power’s thermal assets (to be injected into 
the new JV) will be valued at 1.28x book value, which is in line with GD’s 
trading multiples (1.3x P/B) prior to stock suspension. Moreover, if we consider 
GD Power’s 25% capacity related to hydro power, which enjoys a higher PB as 
per listed peers, this multiple is slightly favorable. Our preliminary analysis 
suggests very limited earnings impact based on GD’s 56% stake in this new JV 
and the combined net profit base of Rmb752mn in 1H17. 
A glimpse of the new thermal power giant  
The new JV will have a total consolidated capacity of 80.3GW, up from the 
52.5GW currently owned by GD. Based on FY16 outputs, the new JV’s output 
is set to be 60% higher. The geographic span will be broadened with market 
share further enhanced in key markets such as Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. 
With the merger of parentcos, GD Power can leverage more on the vertical 
integration with coal producers and reduce earnings volatility arising from coal 
price movement. Nevertheless, the synergy may take some time to materialize 
and we still believe implementation of fuel-tariff pass-through policy and coal 
price decline are more near-term earnings drivers for thermal IPPs. 
Valuation and risks 
Our target price of HKD3.5 is based on DCF with WACC of 8.2% and zero 
terminal growth. Key upside/downside risks include: uncertainties related to 
the restructure, coal price fluctuations, and magnitude of tariff hike at year-end.

Details of the merger plan announced 
After market close today, GD Power announced the proposal of formulating a 
JV with Shenhua by injecting thermal power assets from both companies.  
Meanwhile, the State Council also approved the merger between Guodian 
Group and Shenhua Group, parentco of the two listcos, into a newly named 
State Energy Investment Corporate, which will be the new parentco of both 
GD Power and Shenhua Energy. 
Based on the announcement, GD Power would contribute 30GW consolidated 
thermal power assets and Shenhua Energy will contribute 28GW thermal 
asserts to form a JV, after which GD Power will hold 56% of the merged JV. 
Based on the disclosure, the JV will own 58GW consolidated thermal power 
assets, with an estimated Rmb752mn net profit attributable to shareholders.  
Based on the terms disclosed, GD Power’s thermal assets (to be injected into 
the new JV) will be valued at 1.28x book value, which is in line with GD’s 
trading multiples (1.3x P/B) prior to stock suspension. Shenhua’s assets will be 
valued at 1.16x book value. Based on 1H17 profits, GD Power’s average 
annualized ROA of contributed assets is at c.1.4% and ROE at c.2.6%, while 
Shenhua’s average annualized ROA (of contributed assets) is c.1.5% and ROE 
is at c.2.5%.

Synergies expected after the restructure 
According to the announcement, the restructure will help GD Power to expand 
its thermal power market share in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. With the 
merger of parentcos, GD Power can leverage more on the vertical integration 
with coal producers and reduce earnings volatility arising from coal price 
movement. Nevertheless, the synergy may take some time to materialize and 
we still believe implementation of fuel-tariff pass-through policy and coal price 
decline are more near-term earnings drivers for thermal IPPs. 
After the group-level merger, we estimate the State Energy Investment 
Corporate to have total power capacity of 224GW, of which 174GW is thermal, 
17GW is hydro and 32GW is wind. The company will have 17% market share 
in terms of thermal power capacity with >25% market share in six provinces 
(Tianjin, Hebei, Jilin, Jiangxi, Shaanxi, Ningxia). The company should also have 
21% market share in wind power with >25% market share in 12 provinces (see 
Figure 3 for details). The higher market concentration, in the long run, can 
accelerate supply side reform and reduce price competition.

Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within

taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on.

time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company

published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session,

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
