Goertek released solid 2Q17 results (EPS up 52% YoY) and positive 3Q17 
guidance (EPS up 12% to 49% YoY). Both are largely in line with Bloomberg 
consensus. The firm is positive on the 2018 outlook, backed by continued 
acoustic upgrades (stereo, waterproof upgrade) and VR headset organic 
growth. We share similar views on the strong top-line growth, but remain 
concerned that GPM could keep trending down (on a YoY basis), as low-
margin VR headsets could outgrow the component business. Retaining Hold 
rating. 
Strong 2Q17 operating results, owing to better product mix 
Goertek reported 2Q17 EPS of RMB0.14 (+52% YoY; +40% QoQ) and 
operating profit of RMB622mn (+53% YoY, +50% QoQ) on sales of RMB5.5bn 
(+41% YoY, +22% QoQ). Operating profit beat DB estimate and consensus by 
21%, owing to tight opex control and GPM expansion (up 0.6ppt QoQ to 22.4% 
vs. DBe 21.4%). Dragged down by forex loss, EPS only came in line with 
expectations. Goertek attributes strong GPM to better product mix (higher 
contribution from acoustics). Acoustic sales (speaker/receiver, MEMS 
microphone, earpod) grew 65% YoY, owing to spec upgrade (water-proofing, 
stereo sound, Lightning connector), and market share gain, as well as a low 
base in 2Q16 (the weak iPhone 6S cycle). The assembly business grew 35% 
YoY, mainly powered by VR headset assembly, despite legacy TV/game 
console peripheral assembly on a YoY declining trend.     
The firm delivered a positive tone for 2H17 and 2018 outlook       
Goertek expects 3Q17 net profit between RMB629m (+12% YoY) and RMB 
836m (+49% YoY), driven by new iPhone launch, and organic demand growth 
for VR headsets. The guidance is largely in line with DBe and consensus. For 
2018, Goertek highlights three key growth drivers: 1) the acoustic industry will 
post 25%+ YoY growth, mainly driven by Android vendors playing the catch-up 
game, on top of mild spec upgrades from iPhone, 2) new VR headset launches 
from key clients (Oculus and Sony). We believe Oculus is likely to launch a 
standalone device that can work independently (without being tethered to a 
PC), and 3) rising demand for smart speakers and wireless headphones.   
Valuation and investment risks  
We raise our 2017-19 EPS forecasts by 5% to 6%, and accordingly raise our TP 
from RMB18 (22x 2017 EPS) to RMB20.2 (22x one-year FW EPS). 22x PER 
represents 0.8x PEG, in line with regional peers. Upside/downside risks include 
market share gain/loss and ASP increase/decline.

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on.

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
