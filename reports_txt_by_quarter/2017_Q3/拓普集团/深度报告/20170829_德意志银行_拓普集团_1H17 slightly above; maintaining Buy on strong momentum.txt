1H17 slightly above; maintaining Buy
on strong momentum
44% proﬁt growth on strong demand from local brand customers
Tuopu released its 1H17 results after market close. The company’s 1H17 gross
revenue edged up by 40.1% YoY to RMB2.3bn, achieving 46% of our original
FY17E revenue forecast. The revenue growth was mainly driven by strong orders
from local brands OEM customers, such as Geely, SAIC Roewe, and GAC
Trumpchi, according to the company. By product, revenue for shock absorber and
decorative parts increased by 20.0%/71.0% YoY to RMB1.0bn/1.1bn, respectively.
1H17 gross proﬁt grew 34.4% YoY to RMB683.1m with 1.2ppt YoY gross
proﬁt margin contraction mainly due to product mix deterioration with less
contribution from shock absorber and intelligent braking segments. Gross margin
for shock absorber and decorative parts remained ﬂat, improving 9/90bps YoY to
35.0%/25.4%, respectively.
Together with a slower-than-revenue growth in SG&A expenses (+25.6% YoY)
and 1.1x YoY jump in other income, 1H17 net proﬁt increased by 44.1% YoY to
RMB387.0m, achieving 52% of our original FY17E proﬁt estimate and 48% of
consensus.
On a quarterly basis, 2Q17 revenue increased by 33.3% YoY (ﬂattish QoQ) to
RMB1.2bn. Gross margin deteriorated 1.8ppt YoY (27bps QoQ) to 29.1%. 2Q17
net proﬁt increased by 50.0% YoY (24.2% QoQ) to RMB214.4m.
Deutsche Bank view – sales momentum to remain robust; Buy
We raise our FY17-19E revenue by 1.4-1.9% and FY17E net proﬁt estimate by
5.7% to reﬂect increase in government subsidy in 1H17, partly oﬀset by weaker
gross margin. However, our FY18-19E earnings forecast is revised down by
1.4-2.2% mainly due to more conservative gross margin assumptions. Our target
price is set at a target 26x FY18E P/E (unchanged), on par with its mid-cycle P/
E of 28x. This is justiﬁed, in our view, considering we expect the company to
deliver a 23.5% three-year earnings CAGR in FY16-19E and reﬂects our optimistic
view on the growth potential of Intelligent Braking System (IBS) and Electric
Vacuum Pump (EVP) products. Key downside risks: weaker-than-expected auto
sales volume; failure to record new order awards for IBS/EVP products; any market
share loss at Tuopu's key customers; and unexpected increase in raw material
prices.

not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report
is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.
The Deutsche Bank Research Department is independent of other business areas divisions of the Bank. Details regarding

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
