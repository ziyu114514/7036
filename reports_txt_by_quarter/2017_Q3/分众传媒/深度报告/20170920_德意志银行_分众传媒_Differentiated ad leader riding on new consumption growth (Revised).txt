Diﬀerentiated ad leader riding on new
consumption growth (Revised)
Growth correlated to the new economy
We initiate coverage of Focus Media with a Buy rating and a target price of
RMB14, implying 35% upside potential. Focus Media has recently been included
in the MSCI-A and is a leading player in China’s ad industry with dominant
market share in two channels of advertising: (1) inner building media (90%), and
(2) cinema screens (pre-movie advertising). Compared to traditional channels of
advertising, such as TV etc, these two channels achieve greater impact, given they
are in conﬁned areas holding the captive attention of viewers. These channels
are favored by leading internet/FMCF clients, such as JD, Ali, Baidu, and P&G
etc, which contribute approximately 50% of FM’s revenue. We view FM as well-
positioned to ride the growth of China’s new economy. We project a proﬁt CAGR
of 20% against peers' 10-15%.
Inner building media, the only growing traditional advertisement channel
While the growth of other traditional advertisement channels, such as TV/radio/
newspapers, has dropped in the past few years, we have seen building media
growth remain robust. This is because, amid the intensifying competition from
growing internet advertising, building media is more eﬀective in delivering the
message to targeted groups of consumers and raising overall brand awareness.
Focus Media dominates the building media market, with market share of more
than 90%. We expect inner building segment revenue to generate a CAGR of
16% in 2017-19E, driven by c.12% screen expansion and a 4% increase in ASP.
We believe Focus Media's screens (both LCD and poster frame) will continue to
penetrate into tier 2-3 cities and the company can increase the utilization rate of
its screens.
Cinema media, riding on China's movie screen growth
Focus Media has 60% market share in theater advertisements (ads before the
movie) in China. We have noticed robust growth in this segment in the past few
years (65%/42%/51% yoy revenue growth in 2014-2016), thanks to signiﬁcant
growth in China's movie screens, which have doubled to more than 40,000+
from only 20,000 in 2014. As this segment is correlated with the movie screen
expansion, we estimate that cinema media revenue CAGR to be 13% in 2017-19E,
in line with our estimate of overall movie screen growth.
Revised by adding note on pg22 that Focus
Media raised RMB 4.86bn in 2016 to
complete 100% of the backdoor listing

of RMB7.54bn as of 1H17) on our 2018E earnings estimate vs. its 20% three-year
earnings CAGR. We believe the risk-reward proﬁle seems attractive. Key downside
risks: 1) more theaters start their own advertisement businesses; 2) threats from
other advertising modes; 3) a slowdown in the China movie downstream industry;
and 4) slowdown in the internet/FMCG sector growth.

Capturing China's leading
consumption trend
Outdoor channel mix is increasing
We have noticed that the advertising industry has remained ﬂattish for the past
three years, as shown in the table below, and we forecast the industry will keep
a 2% CAGR for the next 3-4 years.
However, the advertising channel mix has changed signiﬁcantly over the past
ﬁve years. As shown in the chart below, traditional channels for advertising
expenditure have shifted signiﬁcantly from traditional ones, such as TV/
newspapers/radio, etc, to outdoors (16.2% in 2016, including building LCD and
frame posters) or the internet.
Internet advertising revenue showed an average of c. 20% yoy growth for the past
four years. If we break down the internet channel, the mobile channel has surged
signiﬁcantly in recent years. It seems that more users prefer mobile terminals
and, as a result, the percentage of internet advertising expenditure on mobile
terminals, as a percentage of the total, has risen to more than 50%, from only
6% in 2009.
On the other hand, as shown in Figure 3, revenue of inner building LCD/poster
frame and cinema media (where Focus Media is focused) also enjoyed growth of
c. 20% and c. 50%, respectively, for the past four years.

Business model, upstream and downstream
Upstream - The upstream of Focus Media is the supplier of media resources
namely: 1) property management companies for oﬃce/apartment buildings and
2) cinemas. Focus Media rents resources from those buildings/cinemas at a ﬁxed
rent.
■
Property management - As property management companies are
generally small and dispersed, Focus Media mainly focuses on mid-to-
high-end residential or business buildings in tier 1-2 cities to guarantee
their advertising exposure to potential targeted high-end clients.
■
Cinema - From 2010 to 2014, the number of cinemas in China increased
from 2,000 to 8,878 and the number of screens increased from 6,256 to
41,179 from 2014 to 2015. In the coming years, we believe the growth
of urban cinemas will slow down but will still enjoy double-digit growth
(CAGR of c. 12% during 2017-19E).
Downstream - The downstream of Focus Media is the advertiser, who is the client.
Key clients of Focus Media are mainly from the internet/FMCG/Homecare etc, as
listed in the table below.

■
FMCG sector - For a long time, the industries that spend a large
amount of money on advertising have been home-care products, food &
beverages, pharmaceuticals.
■
In recent years, disposable income per capita has substantially
increased, as shown in the chart below.
Figure 7: China Disposable income per capita, 2008-2016

■
In the meantime, brand recognition among consumers has also
largely improved.
■
Therefore, industries with large advertising budgets maintain or
even increase their advertising spending every year.
■
TMT sector - On the other hand, the advertising amount from Internet
companies has also signiﬁcantly increased. This is mainly driven by: 1)
the rapid development of the Internet (especially mobile Internet), 2) the
increasing popularity of e-commerce, 3) the explosive growth of diﬀerent
kinds of mobile phone apps, and 4) the intensifying competition among
internet enterprises. Advertising plays an increasingly important role in
establishing brand image and promoting products' function.

Focus Media
Building media, dominant
position in China
A much more eﬃcient channel
Focus Media's advertising channel is mainly residential and business building
media in tier 1 and tier 2 cities in China. LCD displays and poster frames are
installed inside a lift or on the wall of a lift waiting area. According to data from
EntGroup, Focus Media dominates the lift LCD/poster frame media market with
market share of 95%/73%. In addition, the company also leads the cinema media
by 60% market share as of 2016.
Question 1, why choose the lift as the advertisement channel?
There are several competitive advantages in casting advertisements in the lift
of residential/business buildings compared with other types of advertisement
channels.
■
The lift is a conﬁned space with limited telecom signals.
■
Most people will have to spend 2-5 minutes inside the lift.
■
Focus Media speciﬁcally chooses premium/new residential or business
models in tier 1-2 cities to guarantee their potential targeted clients who
have the consumption power.
■
This makes Focus Media's posters more eﬀective in penetrating the right
individual customers and increases the eﬃciency for their advertising
clients.
Question 2, who are the clients looking for Focus Media?
As we illustrate in the table below, Focus Media's major clients are from sectors
such as the internet and FMCG. Key clients include Alibaba, Taobao, and P&G,
etc. Internet and FMCG's total revenue contribution is 40-50% in 2015-2016, as
shown in the table below.

Unlike other traditional media channels, such as TV/magazine/radio, that target
the mass market (everyone can access to those media channel), Focus Media's
channel is more "focused" on: 1) mid-to-high-end residential buildings and
business buildings, and 2) tier 1 and 2 cities. Those residents and tenants living
around the community of such buildings have much higher consumption power
than mass market consumers across China. As a result, leading internet, FMCG,
and auto companies, for example, would seek the channels of Focus Media when
they launch a new product or new marketing campaign program, simply because
this is a more eﬃcient way to test the consumer market.

Question 3, competition from internet advertisements? Not really
Investors may ask whether, given continuing internet penetration, and especially
with more and more people using smartphones in China, Focus Media's oﬄine
channel will be threatened. We believe the impact on Focus Media will be limited.
There are several diﬀerences between the internet and and Focus Media in terms
of how advertisements are communicated to consumers.
1) Passive vs. active. Compared with the active way of pushing the advertisement
to the screen, the way internet advertisement does, Focus Media uses a passive
Deutsche Bank AG/Hong Kong
Page 9

Hotels / Leisure / Gaming
Focus Media
way. As we mentioned above, consumers are conﬁned within a space with
no signal for a few minutes and therefore, they are passively receiving the
information from the display of Focus Media's advertisements. By contrast,
internet advertising may not be as eﬃcient, because consumers can choose to
avoid receiving or ignore the advertisement pushed through to their smartphone.
2) Barrier to entry: high vs. low. Generally speaking, oﬄine advertising is much
more expensive than internet advertising. Most small-mid scale companies tend
to use the internet as their mainstream way of advertising their products. The
advantage of internet advertisements is that the fees are relatively aﬀordable and
controllable. We list below the pre-movie advertisement rate card for Youku.com
for the year of 2017. The charge for 15 seconds in cities like Shanghai/Beijing is
c. RMB 130-270/CPM, depending on the channels.

Meanwhile, its barrier to entry is also low, in that any brand or product, regardless
of whether it is small or big, fake or real, can cast their advertisements to any
consumers because internet advertising is diﬃcult to track.
On the other hand, Focus Media targets leading companies in each consumer
sector as their clients. We listed the rate card for Focus Media's LCD display in
the table below. The entry level for Focus Media is much higher than the internet
advertisement rate card.

2) Big advertisers vs. small advertisers. Most big advertisers, such as P&G,
Taobao, Alibaba etc would still prefer to use oﬄine advertisements for their
promotion. Compared with internet advertising, oﬄine is better in helping
companies in the following three ways:

Our forecast on building media growth
Whilst diﬃcult to track core earnings drivers...
We believe the "core" drivers for Focus Media should be: 1) number of clients, and
2) per client advertisement spending. Although we can see the company adjusts
its rate card prices up by 20% and discounted prices by 7-10% for their clients
every year, it's diﬃcult for investors to track the growth from its customers and
their spending because the contract is conﬁdential.
…we modeled growth by looking at the annual growth of its building media
screens
As a result, we believe using alternative drivers to forecast Focus Media's growth
will make more sense from the company's reporting perspective. Focus Media
reports its building media screen growth every year. We believe advertisement
revenue from its clients can alternatively be reﬂected in the growth of its: 1) screen
number (both LCD and poster frames), and 2) per screen revenue contribution.
We are forecasting revenue CAGR of 16% for building media
Our forecast is primarily based on two segments: 1) LCD screens and 2) poster
frames. Under each segment, we further break down the growth by: 1) expansion
of its screen/poster frame number and 2) per screen/poster frame revenue.
Expansion of LCD/poster frames. In 1H17, Focus Media has 225,000 LCD
screens covering 90+cities and 1.14 million poster frames covering 50 cities in
China. As Focus Media currently primarily targets tier 1 and 2 cities, we believe
there is still high potential for its screens to penetrate tier 3 or lower cities. More
importantly, with their internet/FMCG clients aiming to penetrate more in China,
we believe Focus Media will also cover more areas in China.
Increasing per screen revenue. This is attributable to two factors: 1) like-for-
like price hikes, and 2) higher utilization of its screens. Management guided that
although the card rate price is likely to have 20% growth yoy, the discounted price
hike is c. 5-7% growth every year. On top of that, the company can increase its
per screen utilization (capacity).

Focus Media
Cinema media
Riding the robust movie screen growth
Similar to the business model and competitive advantage of building media,
Focus Media leases movie screens and casts its advertisements before a movie
starts (pre-movie advertising). Cinema media in China is dominated by only four
players with Focus Media having the largest market share with 60%, followed by
Wanda Film with 20%. China Film Group and Jinmao share the remaining 20%
market share. As of 1H17, Focus Media had already signed a contract with more
than 1,610 cinemas, with more than 10,600 movie screens in China across 290+
cities.

Focus Media
Fixed rent cost, no revenue share with cinema
In terms of the business model, Focus Media doesn't share the revenue with the
cinema. Similar to building media, cinema media is also a leveraged business:
Focus Media will sign a lease contract for the movie screen with the cinema for
a ﬁxed cost and advertisement revenue above the rent cost is the proﬁt. In terms
of the rate card price, for example, Beijing's price is c. RMB1m for 15 seconds
of advertisement per week.
We forecast revenue CAGR to be 13% in 2017-19E
The rapid growth in cinema media revenue in the past three years was mainly
driven by theater expansion in China (over 25% yoy growth during 2013-2016).
Therefore, we believe the growth in movie screens signed by Focus Media in
2017-19E will be in line with our China movie screen growth forecast.
■
Our forecast for cinema media is based on our forecast of China's movie
screen growth and per screen advertisement.
■
After the rapid expansion of movie theaters in China during 2013-2016,
we believe the growth will become milder started from 2017. We also
saw total movie screens signed by Focus Media increase only by 6% to
c. 10,600 as of 1H17 from c. 10,000 as of 2016 (note that signed movie
screens increased by 28% to c. 8,300 as of 1H16 from c. 6,500 as of
2015).
■
Media revenue per screen (c. RMB0.2m) has remained quite stable over
the past three years. We believe such a trend will continue in 2017-19E.
■
Therefore, we estimate that cinema media revenue growth will be
14%/12%/12% yoy in 2017/18/19E, which is in line with our China movie
screen growth forecast.

Focus Media
Cost analysis, mostly the
rent cost - which is ﬁxed
Like-for-like rental cost remains stable
The rental cost of Focus Media accounts for 70-75% of its total operating cost.
Given that Focus Media dominates the inner building LCD/poster frame media
channel with 90%/70%+ market share, we believe that: 1) its bargaining power is
strong over its upstream, and 2) its gross margin will continue to be stable.
■
Thanks to fragmented upstream companies, rental cost is stable. Rental
cost is occurred when Focus Media rents advertising spots from property
management companies or cinemas.
■
Inner building media - as we mentioned before, property management
companies are generally small and dispersed.
■
Cinema media - in addition, even after large consolidations in recent
years, the market of cinema companies is still fragmented (top 10 players
account for less than 40% of market share).
■
As a result, we believe that like-for-like rental costs will be stable due to
Focus Media's strong bargaining power.
■
Total costs will increase by the same growth rate as the topline, mainly
driven by the expansion of media screens.
■
With the stable level of its operating cost, total margin of c. 71% remains
almost unchanged. We believe this trend will continue in the coming
years.

Valuation
A stable cash business for the long term
Initiating coverage with Buy, price target RMB14
We initiate coverage of Focus Media with a Buy rating. Our DCF-based target price
is RMB14, implying 35% upside potential at current levels. As the dominant player
in inner building media, we argue that Focus Media should trade at a premium
to its regional peers.
DCF-based valuation
We derive our target price based on a DCF valuation. Focus Media's operations
are strong and its free cash ﬂow should continue to increase, as the company
dominates the market for inner building media in China. As a result, we believe
DCF is the best way to value Focus Media from a long-term perspective. Our key
valuation assumptions include:
■
WACC of 9.8%.
■
Targeting 90% equity for its capital structure. The company is in a net
cash position at the moment, with very small amount of interest-bearing
debt.
■
Cost of equity of 10.3%.
■
A risk-free rate of 3.9% and a market risk premium of 5.6% (in line with
our in-house estimates).
■
A beta of 1.15, the same as the average of our China movie and media
companies
■
Cost of debt (pre-tax) of 6.0% (our in-house estimate).
■
Terminal growth of 3%. This is the same as our terminal growth rate for
our China movie and media companies.
■
A tax rate of 25% (for terminal growth).

Expenses assumptions
We believe Focus Media’s gross margin will remain stable and net margin
will expand, as we expect operating expenses to decline. Sales and marketing
expenses are the main part of operating expenses (70% of total SG&A in 2016).
We expect SG&A expenses to achieve a CAGR of 7% between 2016 and 2019,
compared to our estimated revenue CAGR of 14% during the same period, thereby
resulting in margin expansion.

yield was 5.4% for Focus Media in 2016. We are expecting the cash yield

Focus Media
■
We believe that Focus Media may use its abundant cash for strategic
acquisitions in the future.
■
On the other hand, given that the dividend payout ratio in 2016 is 80%,
we also believe Focus Media will use its abundant cash to pay dividends.

Risks
Downside risks
■
Threats from other advertising modes. As the internet is becoming
increasingly accessible, online advertising poses a threat to traditional
advertising. Online advertising increased very fast in the past three years
with c. 35% yoy growth, especially mobile internet.
■
More theaters start their own advertisement businesses. Movie
theater operators, such as Wanda and Jinyi have started to do
advertising in their own cinemas. As of 2016, Wanda owns c. 20%
market share in the cinema advertising business. In addition, large
players such as Wanda and Jinyi will weaken Focus Media's bargaining
power and increase the rental costs.
■
A slowdown in the China movie downstream industry. The company's
cinema business is highly dependent on China's movie downstream
industry. 1) Piracy, 2) competition from online distribution and new
media, 3) Lack of supply from upstream ﬁlm producers, and 4) poor
theater locations could aﬀect the overall China movie downstream
industry.
■
Slowdown of internet/FMCG sector growth. Focus Media's clients are
mainly from the internet and FMCG sector. Advertising expenses will be
lower if the internet/FMCG sector growth slows down.

in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts

described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
