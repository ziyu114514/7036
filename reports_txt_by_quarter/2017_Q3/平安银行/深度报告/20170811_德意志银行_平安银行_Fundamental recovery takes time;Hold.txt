Valuation and risks 
We value Ping An Bank using a three-
stage Gordon Growth Model (PV= 
(ROE-g)/(COE-g)), with our target price 
based on 0.8x FY2017E book value. 
Key downside risks: weaker-than-
expected asset quality deterioration; 
faster-than-expected capital 
consumption; and weaker-than-
expected synergy with Ping An Group. 
Key upside risks: faster development of 
wealth management businesses; 
strengthened retail franchise to lower 
deposit cost; better intra-group cross-
selling. More Details on page 4. 
 
PAB reported 2Q17 net profit of Rmb6.3bn, up 2% yoy; 1H17 earnings were up 
2% yoy, accounting for 51% of our 2017 forecast. The uninspiring 2Q17 results 
were mainly characterized by higher funding cost, which we believe represents 
a read-across to other wholesale-funded joint-stock banks (JSBs). NIM fell 
another 15bps qoq. Asset quality has yet to see major improvement, while 
capital remains a concern that is not solved by convertible bond issuance. The 
only sweet spot is the retail strategy, which started to bear fruit in 1H17 with a 
40%/64% contribution to revenue/ profit (vs. 29% in 1H16). Net net, we believe 
it will take more time before we see a fundamental recovery. Hold. 
Key trends of 2Q17 results 
 
NIM in 2Q17 was 2.38%, down 15bps qoq or 33bps yoy; we believe it was 
impacted by a market rate hike and financial deleveraging. Deposit cost 
was up 11bps qoq to 1.92% and interbank borrowing cost up 28bps qoq to 
3.4%. Meanwhile, loan yield continued to decline (5.94% vs. 6.06% in 
1Q17). In addition, PAB saw difficulties in growing deposits (up 0.7% yoy). 
 
Asset quality continued to deteriorate: the NPL ratio nudged up 2bps qoq 
to 1.76% with the coverage ratio at 161% (163% in 1Q17). The SML ratio 
stood at 4.14%, up 3bps hoh; meanwhile, >90-day overdue loan/NPL 
balance remained high at 154% (vs. 158% in 2016). We estimate 2Q17 
NPL formation was 284bps, higher than 254bps in 1Q17 but lower than 
326bps on average in 2016. 
 
Weak capital ratio: The CET1 ratio stood at only 8.13% in 2Q17, down 
15bps qoq, with RWA density up 35bps qoq to 70.3%. PAB recently 
announced a Rmb26bn A-share convertible bond plan but we don’t think 
this can solve the capital issue in the short term. In our view, it may need 
to further raise capital through a placement and reduce its payout ratio 
(2016: 12%, vs big 4 banks’ c.30%). 
 
CIR fell 5.8ppt yoy to 25.9%, driven by a 21% drop in operating expenses. 
It is worth highlighting that its total employees fell 14% YTD, leading to a 
23% yoy decline in labor cost. 
 
Retail contributed 40% of group revenue and 64% of group profit in 1H17 
(29% and 29% in 1H16), which was a positive development in our view. 
We think this was a result of its strategic focus on retail banking and 
cross-selling from Ping An Group. We will seek more details during the 
post-results conference call to be held on 11 August.

We value Ping An Bank using a three-stage Gordon Growth Model (PV= (ROE-
g)/(COE-g)), with our target price based on 0.8x FY2017E book value. GGM 
inputs include terminal growth of 4.4% [ROE * (1 - dividend payout ratio)] and 
COE of 13.0%. 
Risk 
Key downside risks: weaker-than-expected asset quality deterioration; faster-
than-expected capital consumption; and weaker-than-expected synergy with 
Ping An Group. Key upside risks: faster development of wealth management 
businesses; strengthened retail franchise to lower deposit cost; better intra-
group cross-selling.

Additional Information 
 
The information and opinions in this report were prepared by Deutsche Bank AG or one of its affiliates (collectively 
"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources 
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor 
is responsible for the accuracy or security controls of these websites. 
If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. 
Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes investment 
banking, trading and principal trading revenues. 
 
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
