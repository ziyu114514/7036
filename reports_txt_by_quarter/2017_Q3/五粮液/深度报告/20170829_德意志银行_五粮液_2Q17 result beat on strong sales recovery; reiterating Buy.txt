2Q17 result beat on strong sales
recovery; reiterating Buy
2Q17 net proﬁt beat on strong sales growth and expense control
Wuliangye reported 2Q17 results with 23.3% yoy sales increase to RMB5462m
and 40.1% net proﬁt yoy increase to RMB1378m. Sales and NPAT was 10%/17%
higher than our estimates, mainly due to better than expected sales volume and
expenses control. On semi-annual basis, the sales increased 18% yoy and net
proﬁt increased 28% yoy in 1H17.
■
Sales increased 23.3% yoy in 2Q17 (vs 15.1% yoy in 1Q17), helped by
increasing demand thanks to Moutai's under-supply and Wuliangye's ex-
factory price hike (Wuliangye raised ex-factory price from Rmb659/bottle
to Rmb679/bottle in March and to Rmb739 in September 2016)
■
Business tax and surcharges/sales increased 420bps yoy to 12.2% in
2Q17, mainly due to increasing consumption tax base. According to the
new tax regulation No.218 issued by Sichuan tax bureau, the tax base
could be increased to 70% of the ex-factory price sold to distributors
compared to previously c.50% , based on our estimates.
■
If excluding the tax impact, gross margin improved 340bps to 73.7% in
2Q17 as a result of ex-factory price hike and better product mix.
■
SG&A/sales ratio declined 750bps to 28.7%, helped by lower operating
leverage and stronger cost control .
■
Advance from customer balance increase 25% yoy to Rmb5.5bn in
1H17, indicating increasing conﬁdence from consumer demands.
Earnings growth continue to accelerate in 2H17
We expect Wuliangye's net proﬁt continue to speed up for three reasons. Firstly,
Moutai's retail price hike and under-supply will drive the consumers' demand shift
to Wuliangye. Secondly, increasing channel re-stocking demand from distributors
as the retail price are recovering to over Rmb900/bottle (vs Rmb739's ex-factory
price). Thirdly, the margin continue to improve helped by price hike, lower
channel rebate and stronger cost control. Considering the impact from increasing
consumption tax basis, we expect the net proﬁt growth to speed up from 28%
yoy in 1H17 to 33% in 2H17 .
Revise up target price by 13% to Rmb62; reiterating Buy
We revised up net proﬁt by 5-9% in 2017-19E, which is to factor in a better growth
in high-end liquor and stronger expense control, while partly oﬀset by higher

consumption tax basis. We revised up target price by 13% to Rmb62, based on
13.8x 2018E EV/EBITDA, slightly higher than our old valuation of 13.4x, mainly
due to our more optimistic opinion of the company. We reiterate Buy. Downside
risks: 1) macro deterioration ; 2) government's increasing measure on anti high-
end liquor consumption.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
