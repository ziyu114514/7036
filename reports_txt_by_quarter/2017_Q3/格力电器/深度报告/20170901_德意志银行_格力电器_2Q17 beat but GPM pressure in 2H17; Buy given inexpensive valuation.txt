Gree’s 2Q17 NP beat DB/market estimates by 35%/17% due to sales growth 
acceleration and operating leverage. We believe channel inventory remains at a 
healthy level at the beginning of the cold year (end of July). Thus, we raised our 
sales forecasts for 2017-2019 by 7-9%. Meanwhile, we lower our 2017 GPM 
forecast by 1.6ppt to reflect raw material price hike pressure in 2H17. Although 
2018 will be a tough year given high base in 2017 due to property boom and 
restocking, we believe product upgrades and relatively inexpensive valuation 
with 5% yield warrants a Buy recommendation. 
2H17 outlook – channel inventory remains healthy but more pressure on GPM 
For 2H17, we expect Gree to report a 19% rise in sales with 10% increase in 
volume as we believe the current channel inventory level remains healthy 
(~21m units). Meanwhile, we expect GPM to decline 1.3ppt to 31.4% from 
32.7% in 1H17 due to continuous raw material price increase. However, opex 
ratio might remain low as demand remains strong. We expect EBITM of 15% 
in 2H17 (15.5% in 1H17).  
2Q17 NP beat due to sales growth acceleration and operating leverage 
2Q17 saw NP up 68% on sales up by 60% vs 1Q sales/NP up by 19%/27%, 
mainly thanks to restocking cycle and strong demand from retail end. GPM 
shrank 8ppt to 30.2% affected by raw materials cost hike, while opex ratio 
contracted 12.6% to 14.1%. Thus, the company still enjoys an operating 
leverage with EBIT margin improving 7.6ppt to 16%.  
Raising target price to RMB44.4 from RMB38.87; risks 
We use DCF to value the company with a new target price of RMB44.4 (old 
RMB38.87), as we raise our FY17-FY19 NP forecast by 7-9%. Our target price 
implies 13x/12x FY17/18 PE, which is at a premium to its historical valuation 
point during de-stocking of channel inventory, and dividend yield at 4.6% for 
FY17E. Downside risks include competition, subsidy policy, and M&A.

Valuation and risks  
Our primary valuation methodology is DCF. As most of Gree’s business comes 
from China, we use a 9.5% China COE, provided by Deutsche Bank’s 
Economics Team. We use a beta of 1 and a long-term growth rate of 2%, in 
line with our 2.0-2.5% sector assumption for other consumer stocks that we 
cover. This comes to a fair value estimate of RMB44.4/share, implying an 
FY17/18E PE of 13/12x. Downside risks include fierce competition, volatility in 
government subsidy policy, and M&A.

1H/2Q17 results review  
2Q17 NP beat DB/market estimates by 35%/17% thanks to better than 
expected topline growth and operating leverage   
2Q17 NP was up 68% as sales rose 60%, both registering an acceleration in 
growth vs. 1Q. This is mainly thanks to restocking cycle and strong demand 
from retail end, together with an extraordinarily low base in 2Q16. Excluding 
connected transaction with Zhuhai Yinlong in 2Q, core sales grew 42%.  
EBIT margin thus saw an improvement of 7.6ppt to 16% 
During this quarter, GPM shrank 8ppt to 30.2%, while opex ratio contracted 
12.6% to 14.1%. We believe this was due to a mixture of the following reasons: 
 
Raw material cost (e.g. copper (17% of total raw material) price 
climbed 4%/5%/4% for 4Q16/1Q17/2Q17) hike and less promotion 
expense required during a tight supply market,  
 
Recognition of some of the rebates which were booked in the previous 
years, given the air con retail market boom in 1H17.   
1H17 NP rose by 48% on gross sales increase of 40% 
Gree reported 48% NP growth to RMB9.4bn on gross sales up 40% to 
RMB70bn in 1H17. Sales beat market/DB estimates by 12%/11% and NP beat 
market/DB estimates by 9%/18%, mainly due to lower-than-expected opex  
ratio (5.5ppt lower than DBe) despite a lower GPM (3.9ppt lower than DBe) 
resulting from raw material cost hike, and overseas business saw GPM 
declining 8ppt.  
EBIT margin has improved by 4ppt to 15.5%.  Excluding connected transaction 
with Zhuhai Yinlong, core sales saw 27% growth. The company was also 
negatively affected by foreign exchange loss of RMB491m vs. an exchange 
gain of RMB2.3bn, due to RMB depreciation this year vs. the opposite trend 
last year.

Market share gain achieved 
According to China IOL, Gree’s sales volume (sell-in) jumped by 40% (vs. 33% 
in 1Q) with 68% growth from domestic market in 2Q (vs. 62% in 1Q). The high 
growth momentum has continued in July when Gree’s sell-in volume moved 
up by 41% despite a high base last year.   
Based on statistics from China Market Monitor, Gree gained 4.8ppt/2.1ppt 
market share in terms of sales volume and sales value to 34.6%/38.7% in 1H17. 
ASP also increased 4.9% to RMB4192. This is in line with Gree’s strategy focus 
to gain market share which was mentioned during 2016 annual results 
conference.   
By product segment, Gree also focused on centralized air conditioner market, 
which has a higher industry growth with 25% growth in 1H17. Gree 
maintained its leading position in the segment since 2012.  
Its prepaid rebates balance increased 3% to RMB60bn in 1H17. Cash flow 
from operation has declined 68% to RMB3.6bn largely due to inventories being 
increased 134% for the upcoming peak season.   
2H17 outlook 
For 2H17, we expect Gree to report a 19% rise in sales with 10% increase in 
volume as we believe the extremely hot summer helped to digest channel 
inventories and the inventory level has been reduced from around 31m units as 
of March 2017 to 21m units as of July 2017, according to China IOL. 
Compared with 1H17, slower growth in 2H17 is expected due to high base in 
2016, as 2017’s growth driver includes retail end demand (property market 
boom and trading up for better models) and restocking by distributors.  
GPM might be under pressure (we expect a decline of 1.3ppt to 31.4% from 
32.7% in 1H17) due to rise in raw material price. However, opex ratio might 
remain low as demand remains strong. We expect EBITM of 15% in 2H17 
(15.5% in 1H17) assuming the GPM pressure in 2H17 will be more than 1H17.

Additional Information 
 
The information and opinions in this report were prepared by Deutsche Bank AG or one of its affiliates (collectively 
"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources 
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor 
is responsible for the accuracy or security controls of these websites. 
If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on. 
Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes investment 
banking, trading and principal trading revenues. 
 
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://gm.db.com/equities under the "Disclosures Lookup" and "Legal" tabs. Investors are strongly encouraged to 
review this information before investing.
