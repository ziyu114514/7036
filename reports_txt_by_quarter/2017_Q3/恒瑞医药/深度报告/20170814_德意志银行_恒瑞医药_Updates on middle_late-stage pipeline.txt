Updates on middle/late-stage pipeline
Multiple catalysts ahead; late-stage pipeline represents 17% market cap by DBe
We update pipeline progress following the meeting with Chairman Sun. Major
catalysts are: 1) approval of 19K and Abraxane generic by YE17; 2) resubmission
of retagliptin in the near term; 3) clarity on pyrotinib development, including
an earlier submission of marketing approval; 4) updates on clinical progress
for camrelizumab; and 5) phase 3 data release on Incyte's ECHO-301. We also
highlight potential upside from additional US IND approval and clinical progress
of its novel compounds in the US. Our NPV analysis indicated the pipeline value
is RMB9.2 per share. This comprehensive report includes key ongoing clinical
studies for all mid/late study compounds, as well as competitors' studies.
Camrelizumab as the largest driver; IDO inhibitor provides signiﬁcant upside
We have updated our peak sales for camrelizumab to RMB5-6bn in China and
increased the probability of success to 75-85%, based on the strong ORR data
from the phase 1 study. Four registration trials are being conducted at present.
We expect Hengrui to get the ﬁrst domestic PD-1 approval, with safe data from
suﬃcient number of patients required by the CFDA. Additionally, we expect IND
approval for its IDO inhibitor from CFDA in the near term, following US IND
approval in May. We believe it would be signiﬁcantly positive to the IO franchise
and we forecast RMB3-4bn peak sales for the IDO inhibitor.

Our model indicates that the addressable market for PD-1/PD-L1 would be
RMB19bn in China in 2017 and RMB29bn in 2030, representing a CAGR of 15%.
NSCLC and GC are likely to be the largest indications due to a large patient base
and unmet medical need. Our model is based on 14 tumor types, including the
approved indications and major indications being investigated. Among domestic
names, we identiﬁed six companies that are conducting late stage studies for
their PD-1/PD-L1 with Hengrui being the leader.
Valuation and risks
Our current valuation for the late stage pipeline represents 17% of the market cap,
vs. 15% as of our ﬁrst attempt in September 2016. Our TP of RMB58.5 is based
on 42x 2018E EPS. We believe 42x is justiﬁed, as A-share peers are trading at 29x
with 18% EPS growth in 2017 (vs. the 24% we model for Hengrui). We believe
the premium is justiﬁed, given the top China pipeline, major upside from exports
and the potential earnings growth acceleration driven by blockbuster launches.
Key risks include product launch delays and price cuts.

Late-stage pipeline
analysis
Revisiting our estimates to reﬂect recent updates
Our updated valuation for the late-stage pipeline represents 17% of the market
cap, vs. 15% when we ﬁrst attempted to value Hengrui's late-stage pipeline. We
summarize the key changes to our estimates on Hengrui's pipeline below.
■
We increased our peak sales estimate for camrelizumab to RMB5-6bn
from RMB1.2-1.8bn as we expect substantial opportunities for China-
speciﬁc unmet medical needs, such as LC, GC and EC. Our POS is also
revised to 75-85% from 60-70%, as the company is already conducting
four registration trials with initial encouraging data.
■
We added SHR9146, an IDO inhibitor, to our analysis. While the drug
is pending clinical trial approval by CFDA, it has already received IND
approval from the US FDA. If successful, we estimate peak sales to be
RMB3-4bn. We believe this will be a signiﬁcant value driver going forward.
■
We increased our peak sales estimate for pyrotinib to RMB2-2.8bn from
RMB1.2-1.6bn. Our POS is also revised to 85-95% from 80-90% as we
anticipate Hengrui to ﬁle production approval to the CFDA, based on
phase 2 data. We expect better eﬃcacy data vs. T-DM1.
■
For henagliﬂozin, we revised our POS to 85-95% from 75-85% as the
company initiated a phase 3 study in May 2017.
■
For hetrombopag olamine, we increased our POS to 80-90% from 70-80%,
as the company moved the drug into a phase 3 study in July 2017, based
on public records.
■
We added SHR4640 to our analysis. As an URAT1 inhibitor, a phase 2 trial
is being conducted for this drug in the treatment of gout.
■
We increased our peak sales estimate to RMB2.5-3bn from RMB2-2.5bn
as we are more upbeat on the growth outlook on COPD therapeutics.
■
We removed Exforge generic from the model as we are unable to identify
a new BE study after the withdrawal of the application.
■
We now model NPV of RMB9.2 per share from these potential
blockbusters, vs. RMB7.3 previously in November 2016 and RMB6.8 at
ﬁrst in September 2016. We summarize our estimates in the following
exhibits.
Despite the aforementioned eﬀorts, we still believe we undervalued Hengrui's
pipeline because: 1) we did not model any early stage pipeline compounds, 2)
we did not model global opportunities for three drugs in early development in the
US, especially SHR-1314, which would be likely to become the third to market
IL-17 in the US, 3) we did not model US ANDA generic opportunities but expect
signiﬁcant upside as it is highly likely Hengrui would address billion-dollar market
opportunities dominated by branded innovative drugs.

Camrelizumab: the largest value driver in the pipeline
We highlight camrelizumab (SHR1210) is the top priority for the pipeline of
Hengrui. There are four registration studies being conducted at present, including
a P2 study for classical Hodgkin Lymphoma (cHL), a P3 study for 1L NSCLC, a P3
study for relapsed/refractory esophageal cancer, and a P2/3 study for relapsed/
refractory liver cancer.
These data suggest Hengrui has the largest PD-1 clinical program among all
domestic players. Recall recently that CFDA articulated a willingness to approve
IO drugs based on a single arm P2 study; however, CFDA also made it clear the
approval would also require suﬃcient safe data from a large number of patients.
According to management, Hengrui is likely to have safety data from 800-1,000
patients by 2H18 when the cHL study completes. We highlight there are 1,250
patients from all ongoing P2/3 studies.
We continue to think that Hengrui is likely to be the ﬁrst domestic company to
launch PD-1 in China. Among domestic competitors, Beigene entered cHL in April
2017 with a P2 study scheduled to enroll 68 patients (60 in China and the rest
in South Korea) among 17 sites (14 in China), while another compound, IBI308,
entered P2 in April, as well as targeting 90 patients among 29 hospitals. For
global companies, we highlight two PD-1 mAbs, pembrolizumab from Merck and
nivolumab from BMS, are in phase 3 while two PD-L1 mAbs, atezolizumab from
Roche and durvalumab from AZN, are in phase 3 in China. We summarize all
ongoing trials of the aforementioned drugs below.

Diabetes
The company has several innovative compounds being developed for diabetes in
its pipeline. The lead compound is retagliptin, a DPP4 inhibitor, and we expect the
company to resubmit its application in the near term. Additionally, the company
started a phase 3 study for henagliﬂozin, a SGLT2 inhibitor. We believe the
company would be the ﬁrst domestic player to launch a self-developed DPP4
inhibitor and SGLT2 inhibitor.
Additionally, according to clinicaltrial.gov, there are three clinical studies
conducted by Hengrui for PEX168, a GLP-1 agonist. However, public records
indicated that the clinical trial approval for PEX168 belongs to Jiangsu Hansoh
and Jiangsu Hansoh is also conducting late stage trials for the drug. We expect
more clarity for the development of this program in the near term. We summarize
the ongoing trials by Hengrui and its major competitors below.

TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor)
We continue to expect indication expansion opportunities for apatinib, including
major cancer types such as NSCLC and liver cancer. Hengrui is currently
conducting phase 3 trials for these two indications. Additionally, we believe
pyrotinib is likely to be a key focus in the next few years as a diﬀerentiated
therapeutics with better eﬃcacy/ AE proﬁle vs. available drugs. It is likely that
the company would ﬁle production approval for pyrotinib based on phase 2 data,
and it might be the ﬁrst Chinese oncology drug approved based on P2 data. We
summarize the ongoing trials for apatinib, pyrotinib and their key competitors
below.

Remimazolam tosilate is a GABA receptor agonist applied to general anesthesia.
Both the eﬃcacy and safety of remimazolam tosilate are expected to be prior
to midazolam and propofol. Given that the domestic analgesics drugs market in
China is dominated by Hengrui, Humanwell and NHWA, we see good potential
of remimazolam tosilate. We highlight that Hengrui received phase 3 clinical
trial approval from CFDA this June, while Humanwell is doing phase 1 study for
remimazolam.
We summarize the major analgesics by Hengrui and competitors as follows.

Generic drugs
The company has a decent pipeline of generic drugs covering a number of
therapeutic areas. We highlight the following key generic drugs.
■
Abraxane generic: the company is competing with CSPC being FTM
for this drug. We assign 60% probability on simultaneous approval of
nabpaclitaxel from Hengrui and CSPC, as a bear case scenario is now less
likely for either company. We expect Hengrui to grab the majority of the
market share and forecast peak sales of RMB1.0-1.2bn.
■
Advair generic: we expect the drug could reach peak sales of
RMB2.5-3.0bn if the company is able to launch it. However, due to
technical barriers, we assign a POS of 55-65% at present. We also believe
SBP might be ahead of Hengrui for this drug.
■
Cialis generic: the company started a BE study in Feb 2017 and we expect
resubmission of the drug in the near term. We forecast peak sales of
RMB1.0-1.4bn.
■
Celebrex generic: a BE study was completed in June 2017 and we expect
resubmission soon. We estimate peak sales to be RMB1-1.5bn.
■
Lyrica generic: a phase 1 study is being conducted and we forecast peak
sales to be RMB1.2-1.8bn.
We summarize the trials of key generics from Hengrui and some of its key
competitors below.

Key assumptions of the model
Assume 75% discount vs. US pricing and NRDL inclusion
Executives engaged in late stage PD-1 studies believe that the government is likely
to accept a 50% price cut of PD-1 global pricing as an entry point for inclusion
in the NRDL, based on our initial discussion with them. As such, a listed price
of RMB250,000 per year is likely for domestic PD-1, translating into an eﬀective
pricing of RMB125,000 for six-month therapy with additional courses for free. We
model each indication based on the aforementioned prices with RMB125,000 as
a price ceiling per patient regardless of treatment duration.
Treatment ratio and aﬀordability
To start, we believe a treatment ratio of 20% could be reasonable as the number
represents the entire urban population.
These assumptions are the largest variables with the highest uncertainty. We do
not claim to have a crystal ball, while only listing our assumptions in the following
so that buyside could stand on our shoulder to make diﬀerent but appropriate
assumptions.
We assume 20% treatment ratio for new cancer patients of each indication,
started from 1.4bn population and incidence ratios.
■
We examined distribution of population covered by three main insurance
schemes, distribution of respectively funding consumed, as well as the
source of funding. We highlight that urban employees, which represented
only 21% population, consumed 62% of the entire insurance funding,
as such, we believe a 30% treatment ratio is appropriate to start with,
assuming another 10% population would be covered (which would
consume the rest 38% of the insurance funding)
■
We shave oﬀ 1/3 of the aforementioned numbers to arrive 20% treatment
ratio, based on our belief that these pricy oncology drugs would have
a quota system set up by the government payors. Recently, we have
learned that it is likely a quota system would be introduced, for those
drugs included in the new NRDL through negotiation.

We believe 60% affordability ratio is a reasonable starting point, as we assume
patients would have to pay at least 20% out-of-pocket fees, which include
an additional RMB25,000 (assume RMB125,000 effective price per treatment
course) on top of the entire expenses for a complete cancer treatment.
■
A recent survey included 14,594 cancer patients in China, who received
treatment between 2012-2014. The results indicated that average
spending for a cancer patient is USD9,739, vs. annual household income
of USD8,607. Assuming a USDCNY rate of 7, this represents treatment
expense of RMB68,173 per annum. Additionally, the survey indicated
that self-pay is about 78.8%, translating into out-of-pocket payment of
RMB54,000. (HY Huang et al, Chin J Cancer (2017), 36:41)
■
We assume an additional RMB25,000 price tag would reduce the
available number of patients by 1/3, which ends with approximately 67%
aﬀordability ratio.
■
We took an additional 7% cut on this, as the survey was based on 37
tier 1 hospitals from 13 provinces. Recall our previous assumption for
treatment ratio include patients from rural area, which may not have the
same household income.
Duration of therapy
We generally use clinical data from US pivotal studies. However we adjusted key
data based on feedback we received from physicians so far, including:
■
We reduce duration of treatment to 8 months for 1L NSCLC, from 10.3
months demonstrated in KN-024 (pembrolizumab P3 study). We have
learned that response rate is lower at EGFR- patients from PD-1/chemo
combo vs. US studies (for all comers). While we are not sure whether ORR
would be much diﬀerent in PD-L1 high level patients, we lower duration
of treatment in order to be cautious
■
We reduce duration of treatment to 4 months for 1L melanoma, from
6.1 months demonstrated from KN006 (pembrolizumab) and CM-066
(nivolumab). We have learned that ORR ranges from 20-25% among
Chinese melanoma patients, vs. 35-40% in US patients. We highlight
the diﬀerence resides in disease histology and etiology. (please see our
reported published on June 7, ASCO take-aways: physician feedback on
IO Chinese studies)
We await further clarity on key Chinese studies on GC, NSCLC and HCC to further
adjust this assumption.

Available number of patients for 1L vs. 2L/2L+ therapy
In our view, it is unlikely 100% 2L patients would receive PD-1/PDL1 again after
they receive these drugs as 1L therapy. While we realize the market opportunity
would be artiﬁcially lower than actual size by assuming a fraction of 2L patients
as available patients for IO therapy, our objective is to assess a proper overall
market size. This is the largest diﬀerence between our model vs. US model.
■
For gastric cancer, meta-analysis suggested 40-60% high PD-L1
expressors among Asian GC patients (Liu et al, Onco Targets Ther
(2016) 9: 2649-54). As such, we assume 100% treatment ratio for all
high expressors and 60% for non/low expressors. Additionally, we only
assume 44% of the patients would receive PD-1 in 2L therapy, as 1)
aforementioned assumptions leave 20% GC patients as IO naïve for 2L;
2) we assume 30% patients that received 1L PD-1/PD-L1 would receive
these drugs again in 2L.
■
Likewise for NSCLC, we assume 60% treatment ratio for non/low PD-L1
expressors, while assuming 51% treatment ratio for 2L patients because
1) our assumptions for 1L leave 30% patients as IO naïve for 2L; 2) we
assume 30% patients that received 1L PD-1/PD-L1 would receive these
drugs again in 2L.

(9) Median PFS was 10.3 months for Keytruda in KN024, however we estimate response rate of Chinese patients from 1L NSCLC PD-1/chemo-combo study in EGFR patients is much lower than reported US data, as such we reduced duration of therapy to 8m from 10.3m
(10) Based on the median duration of exposure of 8.0 months for Keytruda in KN021G

Outlook of PD-1/PD-L1 treatment
The PD-1 (programmed cell death–1) receptor and ligands PD-L1/PD-L2 belong to
the family of immune checkpoint proteins, which can halt or limit the development
of the T cell response. PD1/PD-L1 interaction ensures that the immune system
is activated only at the appropriate time in order to minimize the possibility of
chronic autoimmune inﬂammation.
The PD1/PD-L1 pathway represents an adaptive immune resistance mechanism
that is exerted by tumor cells in response to endogenous anti-tumor activity.
Two cancer immunotherapy agents targeting the PD-1 receptor has been
marketed, Opdivo/ nivolumab and Keytruda/ pembrolizumab. Both anti-PD-1
agents produced high complete response or partial response in numerous tumors.
Three PD-L1 therapies have been approved by FDA, based on signiﬁcant clinical
beneﬁts in the immuno-oncology space.
Overall high response rate vs. other therapies
Anti-PD-1/ PD-L1 therapies stands out from the traditional anti-tumor inhibitors
on the back of superior ORR (overall response rate), duration of response and
moderate safety proﬁle. We summarize the ORR rates for diﬀerent tumor types
udner PD-1/PD-L1 therapies as below. Notably, melanoma has the highest ORR
with c. 43%, compared to average ORR of 20% for all tumors.

The overall cancer/ immuno-oncology market is expected to surpass USD34bn
in 2024E, with checkpoint inhibitors leading the future treatment algorithms.
We summarize below the top 6 checkpoint inhibitors based on projected
2022E global sales. Among them, two PD-1 inhibitors (Opdivo and Keytruda)
captured accounted for USD19bn market size, followed by three PD-L1 inhibitors
(Tecentriq/ Bavencio/ Imﬁnzi) and one CTLA-4 inhibitor Yervoy. We believe PD-1
and PD-L1 inhibitors are likely to become one of the mainstream treatment
algorithms for cancer and auto-immune diseases given its superior clinical
eﬃcacy, and decent safety proﬁle.

(12 patients); 200 mg Q2W (34 patients), and 400 mg Q2W (12 patients). 49/58
patients received > 2 cycles (each cycle was 28 days) while 36/58 patients were
receiving ongoing treatment at the time of abstract preparation.
SHR-1210 displayed decent safety proﬁle, as the most common AEs are reactive
capillary hemangiomas (79.3%), hypothyroidism (29.3%), pruritus (19.0%) and
elevated transaminase (13.8%). Among the 46 cases of hemangiomas, only
5 patients were with grade 2, and others evaluated as grade 1. Potentially
serious AEs related to camrelizumab include acute exacerbation of chronic
obstructive pulmonary diseases, elevated cardiac troponin, thrombocytopenia
and neutropenia. Overall, the objective response rate (ORR) stood at 31.0%, with
a disease control rate of 46.5%. As for tumor response, zero patients had CR
(compete response), while eighteen patients had PR (partial response), including
10 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients (10/29), three gastric cancer
patients (3/8), one lung cancer patient (1/3), one nasopharynx cancer patient (1/3),
one hepatocellular carcinoma patient (1/3), one colorectal carcinoma patient (1/3),
and one bladder cancer patient (1/1).

JS001 (Shanghai Junshi Pharma)
JS001 is a humanized anti-PD-1 IgG4K antibody that blocks PD-1 interactions
with its ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. According to ASCO abstract 3067, a total of 36
patients were enrolled for 3 indications (melanoma, n=22/ UC, n=9/ RCC, n=5).
JS001 displayed superior safety and tolerability proﬁle, as the most common
treatment-related AEs were of grade 1/2, including hyper-thyroidism (42%), rash
(39%), fever (28%), leukopenia (22%) and elevation of liver enzymes (19%).
Grade 3 AEs include proteinuria (n = 1), and elevated lipase (n = 2). Company
highlighted that emergence of AEs is not dose related. Its PK analysis showed
dose-dependent exposure with the elimination half-life of 6 to 12 days. Among 32
evaluable patients, one melanoma patient has complete response, 7 have partial
response, and 10 patients achieved stable disease, registering an ORR of 23%
and a DCR of 53%. Notably, two groups beneﬁted most from JS001 treatment,
patients with high tumor-inﬁltrating lymphocytes (TIL) (50% ORR) and subjects
with > 1% PD-L1 expression in tumor biopsy (46% ORR). Phase 1 study suggests
that JS001 demonstrated promising anti-tumor activity, especially in previously
under-evaluated acral and mucosal melanomas.
We summarize the ongoing trials for JS001 as below.

BGB-A317 (co-developed by BeiGene and Celgene)
BGB-A317, a humanized IgG4 variant monoclonal antibody engineered to have no
Fc gamma receptor binding, targets the programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) receptor.
It is being developed in solid and hematologic malignancies with doses of 200
mg IV Q3W. The Phase 1/1b study is designed to evaluate the eﬃcacy of combo
therapy of BGB-A317 and BGB-290 (a potent inhibitor of PARP 1/2) in patients
with advanced solid tumors. Upon completion of the trial, further investigation
on indication expansion into ovarian, breast, prostate, gastric, bladder, pancreatic
and small cell lung cancers is expected to commence.
According to the ASCO abstract 3013, both compounds displayed solid safety
proﬁle, as the most common AEs were fatigue and nausea . Immune-related AEs
were grade 3 hypophysitis (n = 1), grade 3/4 autoimmune hepatitis (n = 2), and
grade 2 elevated AST/ALT (n = 1). Decreases in tumor burden have been observed

Opdivo (nivolumab)
Opdivo is a human programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) blocking antibody. It was
ﬁrst approved by US FDA for second line and beyond treatment in unresectable or
metastatic melanoma in Dec 2014. The compound received accelerated approval
given superior overall response rate of 32% in advanced melanoma patients that
failed Yervoy treatment previously.
Following the ﬁrst indication approval in year end 2014, Opdivo expanded
indications to squamous and non-squamous NSCLC, cHL, SCCHN, RCC, UC and
MSI-H cancer. As of July 2017, Bristol is conducting trials in cancers including
SCLC, GC, TNBC, OC, as well as combo therapy with other checkpoint inhibitors
or chemo drugs.

Keytruda (pembrolizumab)
Keytruda is the ﬁrst anti-PD-1 therapy approved in the US and received FDA's
Breakthrough Therapy designation. It was ﬁrst approved by the FDA for advance
melanoma indication in Sep 2014. The compound demonstrated signiﬁcant ORR
of 24% among 89 patients, with one complete response and 20 partial response.
Following the ﬁrst indication approval, Keytruda successfully expanded to
treatment for NSCLC, SCCHN, UC, cHL and MSI-H cancer. Merck is currently
conducting clinical trials for indication expansion to tumors including SCLC, RCC,
GC and HCC, under monotherapy or combo therapy setting.

Tecentriq (atezolizumab)
Tecentriq is the ﬁrst PD-L1 inhibitor approved by the US FDA, under accelerated
approval track. It targets the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway (proteins found on the body’s
immune cells and some cancer cells). By blocking these interactions, Tecentriq
may help the body’s immune system ﬁght cancer cells.
The ﬁrst indication approved for atezolizumab was urothelial carcinoma/ bladder
cancer for patients that failed platinum-containing chemotherapy. In April 2017,
it was then approved for ﬁrst line therapy of UC. Meanwhile, Tecentriq also
received approval to second line and beyond treatment of NSCLC in October 2016;
based on signiﬁcantly enhanced eﬃcacy from 1,137 patients. Roche is currently
conducting clinical trials for indication expansion to cancers including 1L NSCLC,
melanoma, CRC, and TNBC, under monotherapy or combo therapy regimen.

Bavencio (avelumab)
Bavencio is the second approved PD-L1 inhibitor, under accelerated approval
track from the US FDA. Similar to atezolizumab, avelumab is also an immune
checkpoint inhibitor that helps keep the immune system in check. Studies
suggested that Bavencio may also attack tumor cells through a second
mechanism, called antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity.
The ﬁrst approved indication for avelumab is Metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma
(MCC), which demonstrated statistically-signiﬁcant improved response rate with
decent safety/ tolerance. FDA granted Bavencio the second indication of UC
in May 2017, in second line treatment setting. The PD-L1 inhibitor is currently
undergoing clinical trials for tumors including NSCLC, GC, RCC and OC, under
monotherapy or combo therapy setting.

of PD-L1 with PD-1 and CD80. Durvalumabis currently undergoing clinical
investigation in the Phase 3 DANUBE trial as ﬁrst-line treatment in urothelial
carcinoma as monotherapy and in combination with tremelimumab. AstraZeneca
is also conducting additional studies on eﬃcacy of durvalumab in indication
expansion to tumors including SCCHN, HCC, NSCLC, GC and TNBC, as both

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term ratings. Trade
ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high conviction belief
by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a time frame of no
less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to time discuss with
our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts
or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it
diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst concerned or of
the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report
is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments
or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s
judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
