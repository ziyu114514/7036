Expecting growth acceleration in 2018
Solid growth delivered in 2Q17
Hengrui registered sales/core proﬁt of RMB3.2bn/766m in 2Q17, representing
YoY growth of 22%/21%. This suggests mild acceleration from 19%/17% growth
achieved in 1Q17. Export growth was below 20% in 2Q17, according to the
management. We highlight the near-term catalysts for Hengrui: 1) export growth
acceleration in 2H17/2018, driven by new products launches in the US; 2) we
expect apatinib to add another leg of growth following NRDL implementation,
starting from 3Q17 and 3) three potential blockbuster launches in 2019, including
19K, pyrotinib and nab-paclitaxel. We reiterate Buy on rich pipeline and earnings
growth visibility.
Domestic growth in line with expectation; ASP erosion
Growth in the oncology/anesthetics/contrast agents segments stood at
sub-20%/20%+/30%+ in 1H17 vs. 36%/19%/30% in 2016. We attribute the solid
performance to fast ramp-up of contrast agents Ioversol/Iodixanol, while cancer
drugs recorded growth moderation due to tender ASP pressure and law of large
numbers. Management indicated that price renegotiation at the hospital level
aﬀected 1H17 results.
On margins and pipeline progress
GM came in at 86.4% in 2Q17, down from 87.7% in 2Q16, primarily due to ASP
pressure in drug tenders. Nevertheless, OPM expansion was recorded despite
the GM contraction, from 26.6% in 2Q16 to 27.6% in 2Q17. Management
attributed the margin expansion to lower selling and promotion expenses and
admin cost savings. R&D expenditure was 12.3% in 2Q17 vs. 9.3% in 2Q16,
as more late-stage trials were initiated. Management indicated that near-term
pipeline priorities are pyrotinib and camrelizumab. The majority of its potential
blockbusters are in the phase 3 stage, including pyrotinib P3 for mBC, apatinib
P3 for NSCLC/LC and camrelizumab for EC/LC.
Raising target price to RMB60.5 from RMB58.5; risks
Our RMB60.5 target price is based on 43x 2018E EPS vs. the 42x we used
previously. We believe the multiple is justiﬁed, as its A-share peers are trading at
29x 2018E EPS, with 14% growth in 2019 (vs. the 27% we model for Hengrui).
We believe the premium is justiﬁed, given the superior pipeline, upside potential
from exports and potential earnings growth acceleration driven by blockbuster
launches. Key risks include product launch delays and price cuts.

Growth outlook
Hengrui continued solid growth in 1H17, with sub-20%/20%+/30%+ YoY
growth achieved in oncology, anesthetics and contrast agents, compared to
36%/19%/30% in 2016. For 2H17, management expects the apatinib inclusion in
NRDL to add another leg of growth, despite the 36% ASP cut vs. most recent
tender prices. We summarize the key drivers and catalysts below:
■
Exports: Growth in 1H17 was below 20% in 1H17, as a result of limited
new product launches in overseas markets and law of large numbers
for cyclophosphamide and sevoﬂurane. Management expects to see a
growth breakout during 2018/19, as more pipeline drugs are expected
to receive approval in 2H17. Going forward, the US remains the primary
focus for exports, as a result of a relatively established sales/promotion
model and regulatory framework. Europe and Japan would be secondary
focuses for Hengrui, given limited scale of operations and barriers to entry.
We forecast GM expansion from 87.4% in 2017 to 88.7% in 2020, as
exports contribution increases.
■
Apatinib: The drug achieved RMB800m in sales in 2016 vs. RMB280m in
sales in 2015, translating into growth of 190% YoY and a 17% contribution
to its oncology franchise. Management is optimistic on achieving its
sales target for FY17, judging from the 1H17 sales performance and
boost from NRDL coverage. We continue to expect indication expansion
opportunities for the drug, including major cancer types, such as NSCLC
and liver cancer. Hengrui is currently conducting phase 3 trials on the
above two indications.
■
Pyrotinib: Clinical application was recently ﬁled (while phase 3 is ongoing)
for breast cancer indication. We note that the application was ﬁled based
on P2 data, and could be the ﬁrst Chinese anti-tumor drug approved
based on P2 data. As per management, the phase 2 trial for pyrotinib
demonstrated superior clinical eﬃcacy vs. the control group, using Tykerb
(lapatinib) for HER-2 positive breast cancer.
■
Re-submission of 19K and retagliptin: 19K application was already re-
submitted to CFDA under priority review track in May 2017. The company
is conducting phase 3 trials for retagliptin, while guiding that the reﬁlling
timeline would be delayed. While we believe the Street still expects
reﬁlling in 2H17, we pushed back our market launch forecast of retagliptin
to 2020 vs. 2018 previously. As for 19K, it is expected to contribute to the
top line in 2018.
■
Clinical trial update: Management indicated that near-term priorities
would be pyrotinib and PD-1 camrelizumab. The majority of its potential
blockbusters are in the phase 3 stage, including pyrotinib P3 for BC,
apatinib P3 for NSCLC/LC and camrelizumab for EC/LC.

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
