SDIC enjoys higher earnings visibility, as well as stability, than thermal power 
peers, due to its 57% capacity exposure to hydropower. Over 2016-1H17, 
almost all the earnings came from the hydro segments. Meanwhile, SDIC’s 
thermal business can also benefit from accelerating supply-side reform and 
year-end tariff hikes. We expect SDIC to turn FCF positive starting in 2018, 
thanks to earnings recovery and better capex discipline, indicating potential 
upside to our assumed 35% payout ratio and dividend yield of 3%. Relative to 
Yangtze Power, SDIC is an overlooked A-share hydro name, with an attractive 
valuation and similarly strong hydro capacity pipeline. Reiterating Buy. 
Positive tariff outlook, better capex discipline, improving free cash flow 
SDIC’s 1H17 results were slightly below expectation, with a 13/37% yoy 
decline in reported/recurring net profit, but still much better than thermal 
peers, which are near breakeven. Thermal tariff recovered by 7.5% yoy, due to 
a lower DPS discount. Hydro tariff dropped 6% yoy in 1H17 but the declining 
trend slowed in the second quarter. Management expects the discount to 
narrow going forward, with less competition from peers. Furthermore, its inter-
provincial hydro power sales tariff should benefit from the thermal tariff hike in 
July and potentially another round at year-end. In response to supply-side 
reform, SDIC is delaying three coal-fired generation units (total 3GW) and plans 
no other thermal capacity additions over 2017-19E. We expect its free cash 
flow to reach c.Rmb8.0bn in 2018/19E, supporting a stable dividend outlook. 
Earnings revisions 
We revise down our 2017/18/19E net profit forecasts by 14%/4%/1% to reflect 
higher fuel cost, delay in thermal projects, higher thermal tariff due to a lower 
DPS discount and July tariff hike, and lower hydro tariff due to higher discount.  
Valuation and risks 
Our TP is based on DCF with WACC of 7.0% and zero TGR. SDIC is trading at 
12x 2018E P/E and 1.5x P/B, well below Yangtze’s 17x P/E and 2.3x P/B. Risks: 
lower-than-expected thermal tariff hike, weaker water flow, higher coal prices.

An undervalued hydro name 
As of the end of 1H17, SDIC has a total of 29.6GW, 57% of which is hydro 
plants. Its hydro assets are mainly concentrated in Yalongjiang, Sichuan 
(14.7GW), Yunnan (1.4GW) and Gansu (660MW). Over 2016-1H17, the hydro 
business contributed almost all the reported earnings and provides SDIC with 
higher earnings visibility and stability than thermal power peers  
Hydro tariff discount to narrow, with upside following thermal tariff hikes 
In 1H17, the hydro tariff dropped 6% yoy due to a higher discount for market-
based volume. But on a quarterly basis, the tariff decline slowed down in the 
second quarter (-8% yoy in 1H, -4% yoy in 2H). Management expects the 
discount to narrow going forward, with less competition from peers. 
We believe the intra-provincial power sales (especially for Jinping and Guandi) 
could also enjoy some tariff upside, following the thermal tariff hike in July 
2017. Moreover, the year-end thermal tariff hikes will provide further hydro 
tariff upside. 
Thermal tariff discounts narrow, supply-side reform drives structural recovery 
In 1H17, SDIC’s average thermal tariff recovered by 7.5% yoy due to a lower 
DPS discount. According to the management, this is due to more rationalized 
bidding with more coordination between peers, and higher coal prices. 
Management estimates an Rmb0.7cents/kwh average thermal tariff hike in 
July 2017 and expects the year-end fuel cost pass-through to be executed; we 
hold the same view. 
In recent few months, we have witnessed an acceleration in supply-side 
reform in the thermal power sector, with more capex/capacity expansion 
discipline at a nationwide level and a more stringent control over captive 
power plants by local governments. These measures, together with the 
requirements to release advanced coal production capacity, will create a more 
positive outlook for the thermal sector over 2018-19.  
Better capex discipline to support improving free cash flow 
According to management, in response to the supply side reform, SDIC has 
delayed several thermal projects: Meizhouwan II unit 3 (1GW) is delayed to 
end-2017; and the Beijiang project (2GW) is delayed to 2018. Besides the 
3GW, no other coal-fired capacity will be added during 2H17-2019. 
With more capex discipline, we expect SDIC to be able to have Rmb8.0bn 
positive free cash flow in 2018/19, which will support its 35% dividend payout 
ratio as well as a 3% dividend yield.

1H17 results review 
1H17 recurring net profit dropped 37% yoy to Rmb1,290mn, mainly dragged 
by a 60% yoy increase in unit fuel cost, partially offset by a 6% higher net 
power output and 8% drop in financial cost. At the pre-tax profit level, 
Rmb3.3bn is from hydro and a loss of Rmb0.2bn is made in the thermal 
segment.  
1H17 hydro output increased slightly by 2%. However, the hydro tariff dropped 
6% yoy due to a higher discount for market-based volume.  
Thermal output improved by 13% yoy, mainly due to the commencement of 
Qingzhou units (2GW) in 2H16 and improving utilizations. Thermal tariff 
recovered by 7.5% yoy due to a lower DPS discount.

Earnings revisions, valuation and risks  
We lower our net profit forecast in 2017/18/19E by 14%/4%/1% mainly to 
reflect the following changes: 
1) 
4% higher thermal tariff in 2017-19E to reflect a lower DPS discount 
and the mid-year tariff hike effective on 1 July 2017. 
2) 
3% lower hydro tariff in 2017E to reflect higher DPS discounts offered 
by hydro plants; a 1% higher hydro tariff in 2018E to reflect tariff hikes 
for inter-provincial power sales after the thermal tariff hike. 
3) 
10-15% lower wind tariff in 2017-19E to reflect higher price discounts 
to market-based volume. 
4) 
8%/3%/3% higher unit fuel cost in 2017/18/19E to reflect the latest 
coal price trends. 
5) 
Delay of Meizhouwan II unit 3 to end-2017; delay of Beijiang project 
(2GW) to Jul 2018. 
We lower our TP slightly to Rmb8.5 (from Rmb8.7); it is derived from a DCF 
with a WACC of 7.0% and a zero terminal growth rate.  
SDIC is trading at an attractive 12x 2018E P/E and 1.5x 2018E P/B, which is 
much lower than the 17x P/E and 2.3x P/B of its hydro peer, Yangtze Power. 
Besides, its thermal segment can also benefit from the acceleration in supply-
side reform, as well as the potential thermal tariff hike at year-end. Reiterating 
Buy. 
Key risks include: higher-than-expected coal prices, lower-than-expected year-
end tariff hike, uncertainties in hydro utilization hours.

Supply side reform to support structural recovery in 
thermal power sector 
The supply-side reform initiated by the NEA is progressing well, with several 
successive polices issued at central/local government level to control the 
oversupply since 1H16. On top of the demand recovery and narrowing tariff 
discount for market-based volume, better capex discipline and slow capacity 
expansion are helpful for a structural improvement in the thermal power sector. 
1H17 power sector data released by the China Electricity Council (CEC) 
suggests a much slower thermal capacity expansion (halved yoy), stronger-
than-expected investment discipline, and a recovery in China power demand, 
which confirms our positive view on structural improvement in the thermal 
power sector, despite an unchanged coal price headwind in the absence of a 
timely tariff hike. (See more details in: Supply side reform in thermal power 
better than expected, published on 26 July 2017.) 
On 26 July, 16 Ministries of central government jointly issued a notice 
“Pushing for supply-side reform to mitigate oversupply risks of thermal power” 
with the main content including: 
 
To phase out those <300MW units that do not meet the requirement 
 
To suspend construction/operations of those thermal projects that are 
without the legitimate approvals 
 
To stop capacity expansions in those provinces with alarm levels of 
red and orange 
 
To cut new capacity by half for projects that transmit power to other 
provinces 
Furthermore, in the notice, the government targets to suspend/delay 150GW 
capacity and phase out >20GW coal-fired power capacity during 2016-20E. By 
2020, coal-fired capacity is to be controlled within 1100GW (vs. 943GW at end-
2016). This notice shows the government's continuous efforts and 
determination to control thermal capacity expansions, which will help to create

a more favorable operational environment for the thermal power sector over 
2018-20E. 
Moreover, we have witnessed an acceleration of coal mine approvals, which 
echoes government action to release the advanced coal production capacity. 
We summarize coal project approvals in July-Aug in the below table, which 
add up to 82mn tons/year production capacity. We believe the acceleration of 
coal production capacity release is helpful to easing the supply shortage and 
therefore putting pressure on coal prices.

"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources 
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank may act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies or 
otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes on.

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at
