1H17 post-results conference call
takeaways
SAIC Motor hosted a post-1H17-results conference call earlier today. Key
takeaways are as follows:
- 2H17 outlook: SAIC now expects China auto sales to grow 5% YoY in FY17, with
both passenger vehicle (PV) sales and commercial vehicle (CV) growing at 5%. In
other words, the company foresees a pick-up in the 2H17 PV growth rate but a
slowdown in 2H17 CV sales. Management attributes their slightly more positive
PV outlook to 1) recent improving sales trends, 2) an economic growth recovery,
3) a potential last-minute sales rush before the tax stimulus ends, 4) increasing
demand for new energy vehicles (NEVs) and 5) consumer upgrades. On the ﬂip
side, the company expects challenges such as increasing competition, consumers
looking for product diﬀerentiation and a high base in the CV market.
- Proﬁtability: Management attributes the consolidated 1H17 gross proﬁt margin
increase to product mix improvement, e.g. higher SUV sales in SAIC Volkswagen
(SVW) and Cadillac sales in SAIC GM (SGM), but partially oﬀset by price cuts. Due
to slow PV market growth in 1H17, promotion cost was higher and that pushed
up overall selling costs, together with a rise in logistics cost.
- Roewe local brand: The operation achieved a better proﬁt in 1H17 at the
manufacturing level (i.e. excluding R&D expenses) and the RX5 SUV helped sales.
Going forward, the company will launch the RX3 SUV in 2H17E and more models
in future years. The brand is going to roll out more connected car models (similar
to i6 sedan and MG ZS SUV) and will consider capitalizing a part of its R&D in
future years.
- SAIC-GM-Wuling: The JV has been successful in the transition, achieving strong
growth in the Baojun brand (with popular products like the 510 SUV and 310
sedan), which oﬀset weakening minicar demand. However, cost is still high in
the transition phase. Going forward, management still sees demand upside for
Baojun 510, with possible monthly sales of 40k units.
- SVW and SGM: The faster growth in earnings than volume was due to a mix
improvement, with higher-margin SVW SUV, SGM MPV and SGM premium brand
sales oﬀsetting a high sales base and price pressure. Besides these, new SUVs
from Skoda (Kodiaq) and Chevrolet (Equinox) helped enhance the brands' image.

- NEV: SAIC sold over 14k Roewe brand NEVs (up 46% YoY) in 1H17, with 1Q17
sales hindered by a policy overhang. Going forward, SAIC will continue to focus
on the development of NEVs and connected cars, with more models not only
at local brands but also JVs. In terms of R&D, the company has commenced
developing NEV-speciﬁc platforms and setting up JVs for batteries and electric
control systems.
DB view: stable earnings growth and high yield to support current valuation
While SAIC management has become more upbeat in China auto sector's 2H17
demand outlook, we do not expect much of a YoY sales pick-up and hence cut
our FY17-19 net revenue forecasts by 2.0-3.3% on lower sales assumptions for
the consolidated businesses. Meanwhile, we trim our FY17-19 net proﬁt forecasts
marginally by 0.1-1.0%, with lower sales expectations partly oﬀset by higher JV
margin assumptions. We value SAIC Motor at 9x FY18E P/E (from 9x FY17/18E),
which is above the company's historical trading average. This is justiﬁed, in
our view, as we expect SAIC to achieve a three-year net proﬁt CAGR of 7%
in FY16-19E. On a P/BV basis, we believe the company's implied FY18E target
P/BV of 1.4x is justiﬁed, considering its 15-16% sustainable ROE. Despite an
attractive yield, we do not see share price upside and maintain our Hold rating.
Key company downside risks include: 1) a weak reception for its new models
from various SAIC brands; 2) pricing pressure amid industry competition; and 3)
worse-than-expected local brand proﬁtability. Key upside risks include: 1) better-
than-expected sales volume and pricing; and 2) better-than-expected local brand
proﬁtability.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
