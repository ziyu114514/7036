Luoyang HQ visit reaﬃrms earnings
uptrend; raising target price
Order momentum picking up; Buy on multi-year earnings upcycle ahead
We visited Jonhon Optronic's Luoyang headquarters last week and came back
with positive takeaways. Despite lagging revenue conversion in 3Q, the strong
pick-up in new orders, along with new capacity expansion, should accelerate
earnings growth to 26% yoy in 2H17 (vs. 11% in 1H17) and 30%+ starting
2018. With similar drivers ahead, the 2013-15 earnings upcycle - when the stock
outperformed its benchmark (SZCOMP) by 100% on strong earnings growth -
looks likely to be repeated. We raise our target price by 23% to Rmb43 and
maintain Buy.
Strong new order pipeline
Management guided for a back-end loaded 2017 at the beginning of this year and
expects growth for defence and NEV to speed up in 2H. Since the beginning of
3Q, the company has indeed been seeing a strong new order pipeline from its
customers for both segments though the actual signing of contracts may come a
bit later than expected due to military reform (hence organizational reshuﬄe) and
stricter subsidy scheme (hence reevaluation of subsidy eligibility required). Given
capacity constraints (for NEV) and defense customers' delivery schedules, we
believe deliveries could be very skewed towards 4Q17 with revenue conversion
of some orders potentially delayed to 1H18.
Multi-year earnings upcycle in sight, with upside potential
During a 5-year plan (FYP) period, Jonhon's earnings growth tends to pick up from
the third year and accelerate sharply into the ﬁnal two years. With accelerating
weapon modernization, next-generation mobile network (5G in this FYP period),
vehicle electriﬁcation and new capacity expansion, we project a 33% earnings
CAGR over 2017-19 (vs. a 29% CAGR over 2012-14). Taking into account the
high base, our current projection assumes constant growth acceleration (30%
+) towards 2020 but we see upside potential from: 1) successful development
of integrated systems for defense applications (high value and high margin);
2) overseas expansion; 3) new products (e.g., high-speed backplane connector,
liquid cooling system, etc.); 4) further penetration into Tesla's supply chain. These
additional growth drivers, if they materialize, could potentially push 2019-20
earnings growth to a level comparable to that of 2014-15 (+39-67%).
Lowering earnings but lifting target price by 23%; risks
Our earnings estimate cuts of 4-6% for 2017-19 reﬂect: 1) delayed revenue
recognition for NEV and defense business for 2017; 2) lower telecom growth,
driven by slower-than-expected Huawei business; and 3) better-than-expected

product mix. Despite the earnings decrease, we raise our target price by 23% to
Rmb43 as we roll forward our valuation time frame. We base our target price on
a 2018E P/E of 30x, supported by an earnings CAGR of 33% over 2017-19E. Key
risks: further delay in military orders and higher-than-expected opex.

1H net proﬁt of Rmb442m was up 11% yoy on ﬂattish top-line growth (+1% yoy).
1H NP achieved 48% of our previous full-year estimate, largely in line with the
historical average.
The slow top-line growth was mainly due to the high comparison base as 1) some
rush military orders placed towards end-2015 were delivered in 1H16 (when sales
rose 36% yoy), and 2) strong NEV momentum was sustained into 1H16 before
cooling down in 2H16 on subsidy uncertainties.
GP margin expansion of c.3ppt yoy to 36.8% (vs. 2017DBe: 33.8%) is better
than expected, driven by stringent cost control and favorable product mix (higher
contribution from high-margin products).
For 2Q alone, sales reverted to positive growth (+5% yoy) from a 3% drop in 1Q,
with margin further expanded to 38.2% vs. 35.2% in 1Q. NP growth accelerated
slightly to 12% as strong margin expansion was partly oﬀset by higher opex
(+13% yoy mainly driven by R&D expenses).

While no detailed breakdown by end-market was disclosed, at the investor
meeting management mentioned that the defense segment still managed to
grow, albeit at a slower pace due to the high base. By end-market, aviation,
shipbuilding, and weaponry still saw double-digit growth while electronics and
nuclear recorded negative growth.
Sales of NEV segment were down c.50% yoy in 1H, largely in line with the
industry trend. On the other hand, the telecom business recorded only single-digit
growth with strong export growth (+40% yoy) largely oﬀset by slow domestic
business. We note that Huawei's telecom/datacom equipment business (carrier
and enterprise network on a combined basis) was up only 5% yoy in 1H, a visible
slowdown from 25%+ in 2015-2016. On the other hand, Jonhon has successfully
penetrated into the supply chains of foreign telecom equipment players, including
Deutsche Bank AG/Hong Kong

Samsung and Nokia, which drove a 100% yoy increase in its overseas orders in
1H. The rising contribution of export sales also bodes well for proﬁtability as its
GPM is higher at 25-30% (vs. 10-20% for domestic telecom business).
Order momentum picking up in 2H
Since the beginning of 3Q, the company has indeed been seeing a strong new
order pipeline from its customers for both defense and NEV segments. While the
trend has been well anticipated, the timing of orders was actually a bit later than
the company had expected.
Military reform and stricter NEV subsidy
scheme are the two causes for the delay in
contract signing.
■
For defense, the delay was mainly due to military reform, which has
resulted in an organizational reshuﬄe within the weapon procurement
department.
■
For NEV, the delay was mainly because of the additional time it takes for
customers to go through the re-evaluation process in order to be eligible
for incentives as a stricter subsidy scheme is imposed.
Given capacity constraints and defense
customers' delivery schedules, we believe
deliveries could be very skewed towards
4Q17 with revenue conversion of some
orders potentially delayed to 1H18.
The outcome is that customers would place orders very close to end-3Q (vs.
early-3Q normally in the past). For NEV, its NEV production line is already
operating at full utilization now, which means capacity constraints could impact
revenue conversion heading into 4Q with deliveries of some orders potentially
delayed to 1H18. Similarly, for defense, due to customers' strict delivery
schedules, we believe a risk of delayed revenue conversion (into 1H18) also exists.
Taking into account the risks above, we are now expecting 26% earnings growth
in 2H17, lowered from our previous forecast of 43% growth. In particular, we
expect growth to signiﬁcantly accelerate starting 4Q with strong momentum likely
persisting into 2018.

The 2013-15 earnings upcycle will likely be repeated in
2018-20
Growth of defense segment is typically back-
end loaded within a ﬁve-year-plan period.
The defense sector is largely policy driven and heavily planned by the government.
As a result, Jonhon's defense business has showed a clear pattern within a ﬁve-
year-plan period. The ﬁrst two years are typically slow in terms of growth as new
equipment models are mostly at the R&D stage. Growth normally speeds up from
the third year towards the ﬁnal two years (i.e., the fourth and the ﬁfth year) on
accelerating new equipment procurement by the military.
Telecom capex cycle also has a signiﬁcant
impact on Jonhon's earnings.
Similarly, its telecom business is also subject to the telecom capex cycle
although in recent years the company managed to achieve counter-cyclical
growth, leveraging on Huawei's successful overseas expansion and through its
penetration into foreign telecom equipment players' supply chains. In the previous
FYP period, the 4G capex upcycle boosted its telecom business in 2014-2015. In
this FYP period, we expect similar story to play out in the ﬁnal two years, driven
by the 5G network build-out.
We see very similar growth drivers in
2018-20 compared to 2013-15, the earnings
upcycle in the previous FYP period
In short, we believe similar growth drivers could continue to play out in the ﬁnal
three years of this FYP period, including: 1) accelerating weapon modernization; 2)
next-generation mobile network build-out; and 3) strong NEV sales. These positive
drivers, along with a similar capacity expansion pace (Luoyang Phase II in 2014
vs. Luoyang Phase III in 2019), should drive a multi-year earnings uplift towards
2020.
We see upside potential to our current
projections if these additional growth drivers
materialize.
Taking into account the high base, our current projections assume a constant
growth acceleration (30%+) towards 2020 but we see upside potential from:
1) successful development of integrated systems for defense applications (high
value and high margin); 2) overseas expansion; 3) new products (e.g., high-speed
backplane connector, liquid cooling system, etc.); and 4) further penetration into
Tesla's supply chain. These additional growth drivers, if they materialize, could
potentially push 2019-20 earnings growth to a level comparable to that of 2014-15
(+39-67%).
We believe the 2013-15 earnings upcycle
will likely be repeated in 2018-20.

Earnings revisions
Our earnings cuts of 4-6% for 2017-19 factor in: 1) delayed revenue recognition for
NEV and defense business for 2017; 2) lower growth for telecom business, driven
by slower-than-expected Huawei business; and 3) better-than-expected margin
performance in 1H17, driven by stringent cost control and favorable product mix.

Risks
Key downside risks include: 1) an unexpected slowdown in China's weapon
spending; 2) intensifying competition from electronic component suppliers of
other Chinese defense groups or potential new non-SOE entrants as a result of the
promotion of military-civil integration; 3) an unexpected increase in raw material
costs; and 4) slower-than-expected market share expansion in civil markets.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
