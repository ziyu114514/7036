Wanhua Chemical (WHC) is the biggest global methylene diphenyl 
diisocyanate (MDI) producer with a 24% market share. Its share price has a 
72% correlation with MDI spreads, and as  spreads have risen 165% in the last 
12 months, the share price has risen +75%. However, we see more potential 
share price upside as we believe the MDI upcycle will continue until 2020 on 
slowing new capacity additions globally. We also see new product ramp-up 
and potential asset injection as key earnings drivers. We expect WHC’s EPS to 
achieve a 37% CAGR in 2016-19E with ROIC improving to 23% in 2017-19E. 
Strong supply-demand supports MDI upcycle  
In 2016-20E, we expect a 3.5% supply CAGR, below the 4.8% CAGR in 2010-
16 when there was a big capacity increase. On the other hand, we expect 
demand to record a healthy 5.6% CAGR during the same period, driven by 
construction 
materials, 
which 
account 
for 
52% 
of 
usage 
globally. 
Consequently, we expect the MDI operating rate to increase from 87% in 2016 
to 94% by 2020. This should expand the MDI spread from RMB9,500/tonne in 
2016 to RMB15,928/tonne in 2019E, a 19% CAGR. Other PU such as TDI also 
will likely enter an upcycle post 2018E; we see the TDI operating rate reaching 
89% by 2020. Conversely, with the new 300ktpa TDI line expected in 2018, we 
project WHC’s PU volume should increase a 7% CAGR over 2016-19E. 
Entering high-end chemicals market 
Currently, polyurethane (PU) accounts for 55% of WHC’s revenue (71% of GP). 
WHC has branched out to six new business units since 2015, of which TPU, 
PC, and water-based paint are promising products, as China is still a net 
importer of high-end TPU and PC products, and we believe water-based paint 
will be a key beneficiary of the stricter environmental regulation. We expect 
the revenue of the functional material and specialty chemicals segments to 
register a 33% CAGR in 2016-19E and become a second growth driver.  
Asset injection & new business ahead with flexible balance sheet  
As stated by WHC, it is likely to acquire BorsodChem (BC) by Sep-2018 from 
its parent company, Wanhua Industrial Group (WIG). BC holds a MDI/TDI/PVC 
capacity of 240k/250k/400ktpa in Hungary. We believe this asset injection 
would strengthen WHC’s global presence. Besides, the company is conducting 
feasibility studies for the construction of a 1mntpa ethylene capacity and to 
utilise its strong balance sheet (net gearing of 22%/2% in 2018E/19E). We have 
not factored either of these events into our model currently.  
Valuation and risks; target price RMB42.0 
Our target price of RMB42.0 is based on 8.0x EV/EBITDA, at an 18% discount 
to its historical average of 9.7x. We use a Gordon Growth Model, applying 
average 2017-18E FCF growth to its EBITDA. The shares trade at 6.2x 12-
month forward EV/EVITDA, at a 12% discount to global MDI peers and a 36% 
discount to their historical mean. Our target price implies 4.7x 2017-18E P/B; 
we believe the premium to global peers is justified as its ROE averaged 38% in 
2017-18E, which is at a 137% premium over MDI peers. Key risks: fluctuations 
in oil and chemical product prices, lower-than-expected GDP growth and 
unexpected corporate actions with demanding valuation. More detail pp. 3-4.

Investment thesis 
Outlook 
The MDI industry has very high technical and capital barriers and, hence it is a 
highly concentrated market. In 2016, global MDI capacity amounted to 
7.4mntpa, with the top five producers controlling c.77% of total capacity. 
According to IHS, WHC ranks No. 1 among global MDI producers with a total 
capacity of 1.8mntpa (24% of global market share). 
MDI upcycle to continue until 2020E and new capacity in TDI 
WHC benefits most from MDI improvement, in our view. We estimate MDI 
demand will outpace capacity growth and the utilisation rate should reach 94% 
by 2020E vs. 87% in 2016. We expect global MDI demand to record a 5.6% 
CAGR in 2016-2020E, outpacing capacity expansion with a CAGR of 3.5%. We 
see slowing MDI supply growth due to: 1) shutdowns of outdated production 
facilities (including Korea, Japan, Spain, etc.); and 2) lack of capacity additions 
in Asia; the only large new capacity would be Sadara Chemical, with a 400ktpa 
capacity in the Middle East in 2018E. We expect WHC’s MDI spread to expand 
to RMB15,928/tonne in 2019E, a 19% CAGR over 2016-19E.  
New material production becoming new growth engine 
With a more diversified product portfolio going forward, we believe this would 
enable WHC to become less sensitive to the MDI cycle. We expect functional 
material & specialty chemicals revenue to surge a 33% CAGR over 2016-19E. 
Among the new products, thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), polycarbonate 
(PC), and water-based paint are the three most promising products.  
Unlocking value & potential corporate actions 
We estimate WHC’s net gearing should drop to 49% in 2017E vs. the 5-year 
average of 126%. With strong cash flow ahead, WHC would become almost 
net cash (without new investment) by 2019E. Also, we believe WHC’s healthy 
balance sheet should enable it to acquire Wanhua Industrial Group’s (WIG) 
stake in BorsodChem (BC), which has a MDI/TDI/PVC capacity of 240k/250k/ 
400k-tpa in Hungary. This would strengthen WHC’s global presence, although 
valuation is an uncertainty. Besides, WHC plans to build a 1mntpa ethylene 
cracker capacity in Shandong, which will further its vertical integration. 
Valuation 
We derive WHC’s target price of RMB42.0/share by using 8.0x EV/EBITDA 
based on the Gordon Growth Model, at an 18% discount to its historical 
average of 9.7x. Our target price implies 4.7x 2017-18E P/B, which is 53% 
higher than its +1 SD of historical mean P/B. 
Risk 
Key risks include: 1) slower-than-expected demand growth in the consumer 
market, which is the main source of downstream demand for MDI, TPU, and 
PC; 2) slower-than-expected energy price recovery; 3) slower-than-expected 
ramp up in TPI capacity; and 4) any unexpected corporate actions with 
demanding valuation.

Valuation 
What next? More potential upside yet to price in 
WHC share prices have almost doubled in the past 12 months, but we see 
more upside considering: 1) MDI upcycle likely to continue until 2020E; 2) new 
capacity to start in 2018E; and 3) new product ramp-up, plus potential asset 
injection and new business plan. We believe past share price performance has 
not fully reflected the strong improvement in free cash flow and return on 
assets. We expect WHC’s EPS to achieve a 37% CAGR in 2016-19E with ROIC 
improving to an average of 23% in 2017-19E from 15% in 2016.

WHC trades at 10.3x and 6.2x average 2017-18E P/E and EV/EBITDA, at a 
discount of 19% and 12%, respectively, to global MDI peers, but its 2017-18E 
P/B of 3.4x is at an 86% premium over global MDI peers. In our view, WHC 
deserves to trade at a premium to peers given its superior ROE (137% higher 
than peers) and strong free cash flow yields.  
We derive our target price using the Gordon Growth Model. Our target price 
RMB42.0/share is based on 8.0x EV/EBITDA, using 2017-18E FCF to its 
EBITDA. This implies an 18% discount to its historical average EV/EBITDA of 
9.7x while we expect its FCF to improve at a 12% CAGR in 2016-19E, much 
better than in the previous MDI upcycle when WHC’s FCF stream was in a 
deficit. Our EV/EBITDA-based TP is at a 7% discount to the DCF model 
theoretical price.

In our opinion, EV/EBITDA is a better methodology than DCF to value WHC 
because: 1) it addresses free cash flow situation changes as WHC’s heavy 
investment cycle has already passed; 2) it addresses the petrochemical 
business cyclical; and 3) is in-line with our regional petrochemical company 
valuation methodology. We cross check our valuation with a DCF below.

In Feburay 2011, the 
parent company of 
Wanhua Chemical 
acquired BorsodChem to 
execute globalization 
strategy
In November 2014, Wanhua 
became world's largest MDI 
producer 
In 2016, Wanhua 
implemented Industrial 
4.0 project to boost the 
automatic levels of 
production to achieve 
RMB 30.1bn revenue 
with RMB 3.68bn profit
In July 2015, Wanhua's 
new PDH production unit 
began operation with 
propylene production 
capacity of 0.75mn 
tonnes per year
From April to Octorber 
2015, Wanhua's core 
product Polymeric MDI 
price dropped from RMB 
15,000 to  RMB10,000 per 
tonne by 33% in China
From Jan to Jul 
2017, MDI price 
remained at high 
level RMB 22,000-
26,000/tonne
In March 2012, 15 kt per 
year HDI plant  was 
commissioned with world-
class quality towards 
diversification development

MDI 101 
MDI (methylene diphenyl diisocyanate) is an aromatic diisocyanate. MDI reacts 
with polyols in the manufacturing of polyurethane. MDI is categorised as pure 
MDI and polymeric MDI.  
 
Pure MDI is mainly used to produce the slurry of synthetic leather, sole 
resin, and spandex.  
 
Polymeric MDI is used to produce rigid PU foam, adhesive, and 
flexible PU foams. 
MDI is an aromatic diisocyanate consisted of isocyanate and polyhydric 
alcohols. MDI is the most important feedstock for the production of 
polyurethane (PU), which is the sixth-largest plastic after polyethylene, PVC, 
polypropylene, polystyrene and ABS. PU possesses not only the elasticity of 
rubber but also the strength of plastic with wide applications in economic 
activities of multiple industries including chemicals, aerospace, automobile, 
medical treatment, etc. 
Highly concentrated market – MDI & TDI 
The PU industry has very high technical and capital barriers, which lead to a 
highly concentrated market. In 2016, global MDI capacity amounted to 
7.4mntpa, with the top five producers controlling 77% of total capacity. WHC 
tops the list of global MDI producers with total capacity at 1.8mntpa, followed 
by BASF, Convestro, Huntsman, and Dow with a share of 21%, 19%, 13%, 9%, 
respectively. Likewise, in the TDI market, the top five producers control 77% of 
total capacity. In China, the MDI market is even more concentrated with only 
five active producers and WHC’s 1.8mntpa capacity accounts for 62% of total 
capacity. On TDI, the China landscape is changing, with WHC entering the TDI 
market; its new 300ktpa capacity is scheduled to start in 2018, which will 
instantly make it a market leader with a 24% share in China.

PU continues to be key 
earnings driver while MDI 
outlook improving  
 
The PU segment (MDI + TDI) accounted for 55% of WHC’s revenue in 
2016. We believe the positive outlook of the MDI industry aligns with 
WHC’s future performance. 
 
With improvements in the global MDI utilisation rate, we expect 
WHC’s MDI margin to expand from RMB9,500/tonne in 2016 to 
RMB15,9288/tonne in 2019E at a 19% CAGR. 
 
We expect China MDI demand to register a 7.3% CAGR over 2016-
2020, a rise of 1.9mntpa. China MDI demand is mainly driven by 
refrigerators, construction materials, and slurry and sole resin, which 
account for 45%, 22.5%, and 18% of total demand, respectively.  
Formula for a bull market: steady demand growth + 
slowing capacity additions + feedstock cost drop 
Global MDI capacity rose at a 4.8% CAGR between 2010 and 2016. More than 
50% of total MDI capacity is located in Asia, followed by Europe with c.30% of 
total capacity. However, we see global capacity additions slowing down to a 
3.5% CAGR in 2016-20E to reach 8.2mntpa by the end of 2020E. China MDI 
capacity expanded rapidly in 2011-16 with a 16% CAGR and reached 
c.3.0mntpa in 2016, which exceeded the global capacity CAGR of c.5%.  
We forecast another 1.06mtpa of new capacity to come on stream between 
2017 and 2020E globally. Also, Jilin Connell MDI plans to roll out another 
800ktpa of new MDI capacity (c.10% of global capacity) in 2018. However, 
considering several environmental issues, the new capacity is highly likely to 
be deferred. Therefore, we have not included this in our expected new 
capacity. We believe rapid MDI capacity additions should slow down starting 
in 2017.

Utilisation rate picking up 
Globally, more than 52% of MDI consumption comes from construction 
materials, and only 13% is used in refrigerators. In China, MDI is mainly used 
in refrigerators, construction materials, and slurry and sole resin, accounting 
for 45%, 22.5%, and 18%, respectively. China apparent MDI demand has 
remained largely stable at c.1.9mnt since 2013. According to China’s 13th 
Five-Year Plan, the domestic MDI demand CAGR in 2015- 2020E is 7.3%.

Suffering from the rapid capacity growth over the past five years, China MDI 
facilities’ utilisation rate dipped to c.60% in 2015, and will likely continue to 
drop to the low-50% levels due to capacity additions in 2016. Given stable 
demand and consumption growth, we expect utilisation to gradually recover 
from the trough level in 2016 with few new capacity additions.

The rapid capacity expansion over the past four years has caused global 
utilisation to drop continuously, from 87% to 84% in 2015. However, as we 
expect capacity additions to slow down, we estimate utilisation will rebound to 
87% in 2017, 90% in 2018, 90% in 2019 and 91% in 2020. TDI is in a very 
similar situation. We expect it to witness slowing capacity additions and after 
2018, we believe there will be a lack of new supply which should help TDI 
utilisation gradually recover to 89% by 2020E from 83% in 2016.

Margin recovering  
Despite the relatively stable downstream demand, MDI prices, especially in 
Asia markets, have dropped significantly since the end of 2012 till 1H 2016, 
which is mainly due to the rapid capacity expansion. Over the past five years, 
more than 85% of new capacity additions have come from Asian producers, 
and China MDI capacity increased by c.400ktonne p.a. (on average), while 
apparent demand increased by only c.100ktonne p.a. The worsened supply-
demand dynamic depressed MDI prices as well as the MDI-benzene spread. 
Also, MDI prices are highly sensitive to crude oil prices, as aniline is one of the 
main raw materials.

Since 2016, China MDI prices have started to recover from the trough, driven 
by: 1) decreased MDI imports from Japan and Korea, where MDI production 
was unstable or halted, and China polymeric MDI imports declined by 15% in 
the past trailing 12 months; and 2) stabilized crude oil price and chemical 
prices. In the past four years, WHC’s share price and MDI are highly correlated 
with a 0.72 R-square efficiency.

On the other hand, WHC share price correlation with petrochemical products is 
lower than with MDI spreads. The highest correlation with a single product is 
the MDI price with 0.53 R-square efficiency, while the WHC share price has a 
negative correlation with the prices of benzene / Brent oil, which are its key 
feedstocks, at -0.29 / -0.38 R-square efficiency, respectively. 
We believe the MDI spread is determined more by its own supply and demand 
other than cost-push factors because its correlation with benzene and Brent oil 
prices is only -0.18/-0.32 R-square efficiency while it has 0.86 R-square 
efficiency correlation with the MDI price. Conversely, the MDI price has 0.46 
and 0.32 R-square efficiency correlation with benzene and Brent prices.

A more diversified portfolio ahead 
With a more diversified product portfolio going forward, we believe it should 
enable WHC to become less sensitive to the MDI cycle. WHC has set up six 
new business units to further strengthen its downstream products mix. Of the 
new products produced from these six new business units, specialty 
polyurethane (i.e. thermoplastic polyurethane - TPU), polycarbonate (PC), and 
water-based paint are the three most promising. TPU is facing booming 
downstream demand due to intelligent wearable devices. PC should alleviate 
the pressure of high dependence on imports. Water-based paint should benefit 
from stricter environment protection laws. We expect functional materials and 
specialty chemicals revenue to record a 33% CAGR between 2016 and 2019E. 
TPU: expecting ascending downstream demand  
TPU is any-of-a-class of polyurethane plastics with many properties, including 
elasticity, transparency, and resistance to oil, grease, and abrasion. TPU has 
many applications, including automotive instrument panels, sporting goods, 
medical devices, drive belts, and footwear.  
WHC’s performance material business unit is the biggest TPU manufacturer in 
APAC with the widest product range. Out of the c.500kt total capacity of 
China, WHC’s annual TPU production capability is 90ktpa (18%) and offers 
high-end TPU in the market.  
TPU is now a popular material found in outer cases of mobile electronic 
devices. Since 2014, TPU has become a dominant material serving as a 
wristband for the booming market of intelligent wearable devices which 
required high-end TPU. Conversely, China has become a TPU net export 
country since 2013 while the majority of Chinese TPU is low-end product and 
fails to meet the increasing high-end TPU demand. We observe that Chinese 
high-end TPU demand still relies on imports, and TPU import prices are far 
higher than export prices.

PC: WHC a landscape changer in China 
Polycarbonate (PC) is one of the five engineering plastics. PC is widely used in 
electronic devices, household appliances, construction materials, automobile 
manufacturing, and medical apparatus. PC has become the most popular 
engineering plastic with the highest growth rate.  
PC manufacturing has very high technological barriers; therefore, the PC 
market is highly concentrated. Covestro (27% market share) is the global 
market leader and global capacity is at 4.7mntpa, on our estimates. Currently, 
China PC demand highly relies on imports.  
WHC’s new PC line is expected to come on stream in 2018E, and it will 
instantly become the second-largest (17% of China capacity) PC producer in 
China. The company spent about RMB1.46bn on the 200ktpa capacity after it 
raised RMB2.5bn from a private placement in January 2017.

Water-based paint: the beneficiary of the “strictest” new environmental 
protection law 
Compared with traditional paint, water-based paint is more environmentally 
friendly and cost efficient. In the global market, water-based paint has 
surpassed traditional paint; it accounted for c.44% of the total paint 
consumption in 2014. In China, the consumption of water-based paint used in 
construction materials and automobile paint is growing rapidly, accounting 
c.48%.  
Water-based paint should benefit from stricter environment protection laws. 
We expect the revenue of main business including MDI and the new chemical 
products to see a CAGR of 21% in 2016-19E. As MDI only accounts for 41.7% 
of the growth rate, we estimate the rest will come from new chemical 
products and other core business segments including functional materials and

Since 2015, there has been a paint tax of 4% under the new environment 
protection law. However, paint with Volatile Organic Compounds (VOC) of less 
than 420g/L will be waived from the paint tax. The 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-
2020) petrochemical and chemicals development guidance also notes that 
producers should facilitate the R&D and promotion process of environmentally 
friendly 
paints 
and 
efficiently 
control 
the 
VOCs. 
Being 
the 
most 
environmentally friendly paint, water-based paint should be one of the main 
beneficiaries of the “strictest” environment protection law as well as the 
development guidance.

Advantages
Content
Environmental advantages
The traditional solvent based paint has volatile organic compounds (VOC), which will cause pollution to atmosphere 
environment. Long-term exposure to high VOC environment places people at serious risk of cancer. By contrast, water-
based paints have zero emissions of VOC.
Economic advantages
Solvent based paints represent 75% of total 15 million tons industrial paints. If 50% will be replaced by water-based paints, 
RMB15bn will be saved.
Policy guidance advantages
Since Feb. 1st, 2015, the government has levied 4% of consumption tax on coatings, with the exception of VOC lower than 
420g/L in the construction process.
Other advantages
The inflammable and explosive problem during transportation, construction and production can be solved completely as 
the dominating part is water.

Unlocking value & 
potential corporate actions 
WHC improved its balance sheet via issuance of 158mn new shares to repay 
debt and set up new business in 2016. WHC’s net gearing should cut to 49% 
in 2017E from 118% in 2016. All of WHC’s debt is in bank loans after repaying 
the corporate bond in 2015. We expect that WHC’s net interest expense 
should decrease to RMB504mn in 2019E from RMB890mn in 2015.  
Moreover, as mentioned during public management meetings, the company is 
likely to acquire WIG’s stake in BC by September 2018 which has a 
MDI/TDI/PVC capacity of 240kpta / 250ktpa / 400ktpa in Hungary. Besides the 
benefit of having instant capacity expansion, we believe the planned asset 
injection could strengthen WHC’s global presence although valuation is an 
uncertainty. Nowadays, MDI / TDI / PVC constructions usually cost about 
RMB1.9bn / RMB2.1bn / RMB0.4bn for a 100ktpa of capacity. The overall 
replacement cost for such capacity would be near RMB11.4bn.

BC’s MDI and TDI capacity is equivalent to 13% / 83% of WHC 2018E capacity. 
Our sensitivity analysis suggests BC has the potential to bring another 17% of 
EBIT to WHC, assuming BC achieves a 75% utilisation rate with gross margins 
of MDI / TDI similar to those of WHC, a PVC margin of USD240/tonne and its 
operating expenses per unit doubles that of WHC. We have not factored any 
potential acquisition in our model. 
Besides, the company is conducting feasibility studies for constructing a 
1mntpa ethylene capacity in Shandong, to utilise its expected net cash balance 
sheet. We estimate WHC will reach close to net cash by 2019 and the potential 
1 mntpa ethylene project will cost about USD4bn (RMB32bn in 2019E based 
on our USD/RMB exchange rate forecast). If all these projects are realised by 
2019E, assuming acquiring BC at market replacement cost and new ethylene 
capex spend across 2019E-2022E, we estimate WHC’s net gearing would jump

to c.46% by the end of 2019. Hence, we see <50% of net gearing level as low 
risk for further equity raising.  
Sensitivity analysis 
WHC’s earnings and target price are sensitive to MDI prices. Our sensitivity 
analysis suggests for each 5% change in the MDI price, 2017E EPS would 
change by 9%, and our target price would change by 10% correspondingly. 
The earnings and target price sensitivity beta to MDI is c.1.8-2.0x. WHC’s 
earnings and target price are also sensitive to the benzene price which is the 
biggest cost factor for WHC. For each 5% change in the benzene price, 2017E 
EPS and target price would change by 3% and 4%, respectively.

WHC’s target price is more sensitive to the MDI price than the Benzene price. 
According to our scenario analysis, if the MDI price increases by 15% and the 
benzene price decreases by 15%, this would raise our target price by 41% to 
RMB59. On the other hand, if the MDI price goes down by 15% and the 
benzene price increases by 15%, our target price would fall 41% to RMB24.9. 
These scenarios are more favorable to the upside comparison.

Consensus 
Our estimates are slightly higher than Bloomberg Finance LP consensus 
estimates by 9-11%. We believe this is mainly due to our constructive view on 
the MDI price trend. 
MDI price has more influence 
than Benzene price on WHC’s 
share price

Valuation charts 
WHC is trading at 3.4x forward P/B, higher than +1SD of the historical average 
of 3.1x. We believe it is not fully reflecting a ROE rerating potential, which we 
expect to reach 41% in 2017E.  
On the other hand, the 6.2x forward EV/EBITDA is 36% below its historical 
average of 9.7x or 3% below -1 SD of the historical average of 6.4x. Moreover, 
the current trading multiple of 10.3x forward P/E is an 8% discount to its 
historical average P/E.

Income statement 
ROIC to increase significantly in 2017E 
On the back of higher MDI prices and expansion of new chemical product 
range, we forecast revenue will increase 38%, 12%, and 14% in 2017E, 2018E, 
and 2019E, respectively. We estimate GPM should gradually recover from 31% 
in 2016 to 40% in 2019E. ROIC will also likely rebound sharply to an average of 
23% in 2017-19E from 15% in 2016.

MDI passed the toughest time, and new chemicals come to the stage 
We expect MDI prices and spreads to further strengthen, driven by energy 
prices recovery, slowing global new capacity additions and stable demand 
growth. We project the PU segment’s GPM will be 50-56% in 2017E-19E vs. 
41% in 2016. Functional material and special chemicals are the second growth 
engine. As such, we estimate the two segments’ combine revenue will more 
than double during 2016-2019. We expect petrochemical projects to run at full 
steam in 2017-19 after two years of capacity ramp-up since 2015.

Balance sheet 
Net gearing ratio will drop significantly  
On 16 January 2017, WHC issued 116mn new shares at RMB21.55/share for a 
total sum of RMB2.5bn to develop its new business. After deleveraging, we 
estimate the net gearing ratio will drop to 49% in 2017 from 119% in 2016. 
With strong cash flow ahead, we expect net gearing will drop to 2% if no new 
project announced.  
Working capital  
We expect working capital inflow in 2017 due to an increase in the amount of 
trade payables, which offset an increase in trade receivables. Trade 
receivable/payable days will likely remain largely stable, but inventory days 
should drop to 60 days in 2017E from 74 days in 2015.

Cash flow statement 
Issuing new shares  
WHC raised RMB2.5bn via private placement at a placement price of 
RMB21.55/share. Of the raised funds, RMB1.46bn will be invested in new PC 
projects with total capacity of 200ktpa. RMB400mn will be used to build WHC 
Shanghai Center, and the rest of funds will be used to repay bank loans and 
replenish working capital. 
Dividend and capital expenditure  
WHC’s capex should remain at c.RMB3.3-3.6bn, which is the maintenance 
capex, given the company does not have any Greenfield investment committed 
currently. Moreover, in keeping with trends we have observed, WHC will likely 
continue to increase dividends, with the payout ratio likely to increase from 
31% in 2016 to 35% in 2017E and further to 40% in 2018-19E.

taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that are consistent or inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer term 
ratings. Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high 
conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or sector delineated over a 
time frame of no less than two weeks. In addition to SOLAR ideas, the analysts named in this report may from time to 
time discuss with our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently 
becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company 
specific economic prospects make it difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion 
of the coverage analyst concerned or of the Research Department Management and as such the majority of reports are 
published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account 
the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation 
of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are 
inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not 
be suitable for all investors and investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of 
financial instruments are subject to change without notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of 
price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's 
currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily 
indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session, 
and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, 
subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed 
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to 
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the 
index fixings may -- by construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended 
to track. The choice of the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon 
rates (i.e., coupons indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is 
also important to acknowledge that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are 
denominated carries FX risk. Naturally, options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. 
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own 
circumstances including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and 
liabilities, and as such, investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar 
to or inspired by the contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can 
be substantial. As a result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be 
incurred that are greater than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable 
for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized 
Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the 
website please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed 
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk. 
 
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
