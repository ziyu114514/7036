1H17 a miss; strong earnings rebound
unlikely
16% YoY 1H17 proﬁt drop on declining sales volume at local brand and JVs
Chang’an Auto released its 1H17 results after market close on 30 August. The
company’s 1H17 net revenue decreased 6.2% YoY to RMB32.1bn, on 0.2% YoY
decline in Chang'an brand sales volume to 729k units. 1H17 gross proﬁt margin
deteriorated by 2.4ppt YoY, probably due to ﬁerce market competitions amongst
local brands and consequent price promotions, in our view. Meanwhile, there
was a 26.4% YoY earnings contribution decline from its JVs/associates, caused
by 11.9% YoY sales volume drop at Chang’an Ford JV, probably due to aging
product portfolio and exhaustion of small-engine car demand after cutback in
tax incentive, in our view. Yet helped by an increase in government subsidies,
Chang'an's 1H17 net proﬁt only fell by 15.9% YoY to RMB4.6bn.
Deutsche Bank view – unexciting portfolio unlikely to drive a 2H17E proﬁt
rebound
With the originally popular products' sales going downhill and a lack of new 'killer'
products in sight, especially at the major earnings contributor Chang’an Ford, we
doubt if Chang’an can stage a strong earnings rebound in upcoming quarters.
Hence, we trim our FY17-19E net revenue by 5.8-6.1% on lower local brand sales
assumption. We also cut our FY17-19E net proﬁt by 6.7-7.2% mainly on 1) lower
margin assumption for local brand amid competitions, 2) lower earnings from
Chang’an Ford amid weak model sales, partially oﬀset by an increase in subsidy
income.
We value Chang'an at 7.0x FY18E P/E (roll-over from 7.0x FY17/18E), which is
below the company's historical trading average. This is justiﬁed, in our view, as
we expect Chang'an to suﬀer mild net proﬁt decline going forward (-2% FY16-19E
CAGR) vs. strong growth in the past (45% FY13-16 CAGR). Given a lack of share
price upside vs. our target price, we maintain our Hold rating. Key downside risks
include: 1) weaker-than-expected vehicle sales, 2) pricing pressure , and 3) worse-
than-expected local brand proﬁtability. Key upside risks include: 1) better-than-
expected new and old models sales , and 2) a stronger-than-expected earnings
rebound at the local brand.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
