1H17 behind; new energy bus sales
pick-up in sight
1H17 not a surprise; 35% net proﬁt decline on 27% sales volume drop
Yutong Bus reported 34.8% YoY 1H17 net proﬁt decline to RMB805.1m. The
company’s 1H17 revenue decreased by 29.8% YoY to RMB9.3bn on the back of
26.7% YoY decrease in bus sales volume to 21,828 units. Yutong’s 1H17 net proﬁt
accounted for 20% of our original FY17 earnings forecasts and 21% of consensus.
Although the result is lower than Yutong’s recent year performance (1H16 net
proﬁt accounted for 31% of FY16 proﬁt and 1H15 27% of FY15), we believe it
brings no surprises to the market given weak 1H17 NEV bus sales.
Due to the product mix shift with decline in sales contribution from new energy
buses and partially oﬀset by reduction in procurement costs, in our view, gross
proﬁt margin contracted merely by 26bps YoY to 24.2% in 1H17. Meanwhile,
operating proﬁt margin narrowed by 2.1ppt YoY on 1.9ppt YoY expansion in SG&A
expenses ratio.
With a 55.7% decline in non-operating income, partially mitigated by 1)
RMB39.5m gain on a change in fair value (vs. loss of RMB44.8m in 1H16) mainly
from ﬁnancial assets; 2) RMB75.0m investment gain (up 1.7x YoY) due to higher
contribution from JV/associates; and 3) 72.5% YoY decline in impairment loss on
assets, 1H17 net proﬁt margin decreased 67bps to 8.6%.
On a quarterly basis, Yutong’s 2Q17 revenue declined 33.1% YoY but improved
40.7% QoQ to RMB5.4bn. Gross proﬁt margin remained ﬂattish YoY and expanded
1.6ppt QoQ to 24.8%. 2Q17 net proﬁt dropped 42.9% YoY but increased 54.6%
QoQ to RMB488.8m.
Deutsche Bank view – new energy bus demand to recover; maintain Buy
We cut our FY17-19E revenue estimates by 8.9-13.6% and net proﬁt by
13.1-14.5% mainly on reduced NEV bus sales forecast. Meanwhile, we forecast
stable NEV gross margins for Yutong going forward, on cost reduction and
better mix mitigating cuts in subsidies, leading to consistent c.60% gross proﬁt
contribution from the NEV bus business.
We believe the NEV bus demand will continue to recover on the clariﬁcation
of some local government subsidy and new subsidy eligibility list. Maintain
Buy given our optimism on Yutong's increasing proﬁt contribution from NEV
bus segment. Target price is based on 14x FY18E P/E (rolled forward from 14x
FY17E P/E), c.30% above Yutong's mid-cycle P/E of 11x to reﬂect our optimism

on increasing proﬁt contribution from the new energy bus. Key downside risks
include: 1) unexpected changes in the Chinese government's new energy bus
subsidy policy; 2) weaker-than-expected new energy bus demand; and 3) market
share loss in new energy buses.

Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its

Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies or otherwise.

our clients, Deutsche Bank salespersons and Deutsche Bank traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if any opinion, forecast or estimate contained herein changes or subsequently becomes inaccurate. Coverage and
the frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company speciﬁc economic prospects make it

judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors and investors must make
their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without
notice and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial
instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely
aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Unless otherwise indicated, prices
are current as of the end of the previous trading session, and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg
and other vendors. Data is sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and in some cases, other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash ﬂows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of ﬁxed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to FX depreciation, or to
speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index ﬁxings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that diﬀers from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options”, at http://
www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to access the website please contact
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
?
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
aﬀected by the currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
?
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at https://
