Zhejiang Jingsheng (JSG)’s net profit in 2022 surged 71% YoY to RMB2.9bn, in 
line with the pre-announced profit released in mid-Mar. Net profit in 4Q22 grew 
52% YoY to RMB915mn. As of end-2022, total backlog (as of Jun) reached 
RMB25.4bn (solar/semiconductor: 87%/13%). We estimate this offers good 
visibility over the coming 18 months. In the foreseeable future, we believe JSG 
will remain a key beneficiary of the tight supply of crucibles. We therefore revise 
up our earnings forecast in 2023E/24E both by 9%, due to higher revenue and 
margin assumptions on the materials segments. We raise our TP to RMB99, 
based on 33x 2023E P/E on the back of 33% earnings growth in 2023E. Longer 
term, import substitution through continuous breakthrough in semiconductor 
equipment, including SiC, will offer upside to our current estimates. Maintain BUY.   
 Strong growth of materials segment. Revenue grew 78% YoY to 
RMB10.6bn in 2022. By segment, equipment revenue (solar + semiconductor) 
grew 70% YoY RMB8.47bn. Materials revenue (crucibles, diamond wire saw 
& sapphire) surged 2.7x YoY to RMB1.46bn, implying 4.5x YoY growth in 
2H22. Materials gross margin sharply expanded by 14.5ppt YoY to 39% in 
2022, which partially offset the 1.8ppt contraction of equipment segment (to 
40.8%). Blended gross margin in 2022 was therefore largely stable at 39.6%.  
 Operating expense largely under control. SG&A ratio dropped 0.7ppt YoY 
to 3.1% in 2022 while R&D expense ratio increased 1.6ppt YoY to 7.5% which 
we believe is essential given the continuous development of new technology. 
JSC recognized RMB538mn (+85% YoY) gains in 2022, which came mainly 
from government subsidies.  
 Substantial increase in customers’ downpayment. As at Dec 2022, 
contract liabilities (an indicator of down-payment from customers) surged 91% 
YoY to RMB9.47bn. We believe this suggests strong bargaining power of JSG.   
 Decline in operating cash flow should be temporary. Operating cash flow 
dropped 24% YoY to RMB1.3bn in 2022, due to large increase in inventory 
(up >RMB6bn YoY). That said, 75% of the total inventories as of end-2022 
(RMB12.3bn) belonged to goods in transit. We expect the cash flow to see 
improvement in 1H23E.    
 Risks: 1) Slowdown in solar power capex; 2) lower-than-expected gross 
margin; (3) risk of semiconductor business expansion.
