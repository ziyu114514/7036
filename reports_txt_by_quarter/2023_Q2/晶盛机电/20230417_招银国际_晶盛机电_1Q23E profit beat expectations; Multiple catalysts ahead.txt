Zhejiang Jingsheng (300316 CH) 
 
 
 
1Q23E profit beat expectations; Multiple 
catalysts ahead  
 
Zhejiang Jingsheng (JSG) preannounced over the weekend that net profit in 
1Q23 is expected to surge 81-103% YoY to RMB800-900mn, which is better 
than expectation. We believe this was likely driven by strong growth of crucibles 
revenue and margin, as well as faster-than-expected equipment delivery. We 
revise up our earnings forecast in 2023E/24E/25E by 11%/10%/7%. We revise 
up our TP to RMB106, based on 32x 2023E P/E, on the back of 32% earnings 
CAGR in 2023E-24E. Reiterate BUY. Upcoming catalysts include: (1) the launch 
of the 5th generation crystal growing furnace in 2Q23E; (2) new orders on solar 
cell & module equipment; and (3) spin-off of crucible business unit.   
 5th generation crystal growing furnace to be launched. JSG recently 
completed the R&D of the 5th generation furnace. According to JSG, the new 
generation furnace will allow the customers to develop their own software 
systems so as to offer differentiated products. We expect JSG to announce 
the new product in May.    
 TCL Zhonghuan’s latest expansion plan positive to JSG. TCL 
Zhonghuan (002129 CH, NR) announced last week that it plans to raise 
RMB13.8bn through the issuance of CB to finance two capacity expansion 
plans (total capex RMB14.3bn). First, Zhonghuan plans to spend 
RMB3.65bn on a smart factory with annual wafer capacity of 35GW. We 
expect JSG will win the majority of equipment orders. Second, Zhonghuan 
will spend RMB10.7bn to build a smart factory for TOPCon solar cell (annual 
capacity: 25GW). Given the long-standing cooperation between Zhonghuan 
and JSG, we see chance for JSG to start winning orders for solar cell 
equipment.       
 Spin-off of crucible business. JSG announced last week that it plans to 
spin off Meijing New Materials (美晶新材料) for separate listing. Meijing is 
the subsidiary of JSG, which is mainly engaged in the production and sales 
of crucibles for both solar power and semiconductor sector. The monthly 
production capacity of crucibles is expected to increase from 15k units as of 
end-2022 to >20k units in 3Q23E. JSG currently owns 57.8% of Meijing. 
OJing Science & Technology (001269 CH, NR), major peer of Meijing, is 
currently trading at 27x 2023E P/E (Bloomberg consensus).  
 We revise up our net profit forecast in 2023E/24E/25E by 11%/10%/7% 
to reflect (1) 21%/19%/16% increase in revenue, driven by higher growth 
assumption on materials and faster equipment delivery; (2) higher gross 
margin due to price hike of crucibles. Our net profit revision is less than that 
of the revenue as our MI assumption is higher (JSG owns 57.8% of crucible 
business).
