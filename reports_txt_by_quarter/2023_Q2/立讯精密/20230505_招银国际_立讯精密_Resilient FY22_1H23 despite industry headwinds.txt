Resilient FY22/1H23 despite industry headwinds 
 
Luxshare posted FY22 revenue/NP growth of 39%/30% YoY, largely in-line with 
expectations, and it also pre-announced 1H23 earnings growth of 10-20% YoY, 
which we believe is resilient given weakness in smartphone/ consumer 
electronics market. Given challenging macro headwinds, Luxshare delivered 
impressive operating efficiency and cost synergies. Looking forward, following 
multiple strategic M&As in 2020/21, we believe Luxshare is well-positioned to 
gain share in iPhone/Macbook/iPad/Watch OEM/components, and capture 
opportunities in automobile tier-1 biz and AR/VR product cycle. We adjusted 
FY23-25E EPS by -2%/+2% to reflect macro headwinds and accelerated auto 
segment. The stock now trades at 15.2x FY23E P/E, close to 1-sd below 5-yr 
average P/E. Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB48.0 based on lowered 28x 
FY23E P/E. Upcoming catalysts include Apple MR launch in June. 
 FY22/1H23 earnings largely in-line; Impressive growth in smartphone 
components/OEM. Despite global macro weakness, rising inflation and 
geopolitical uncertainties, Luxshare delivered a solid set of FY22 results 
with sales/NP growth of 39/30% YoY. By segment, computer/automotive/ 
communications/consumer electronics revenue grew 44%/48%/293%/33% 
YoY, while GPM was largely stable at 12.2% in FY22. In particular, its 
subsidiary, Luxcase Precision (casing & top module), reported revenue/net 
profit growth of 49%/102% and NPM improved 0.7ppt YoY to 2.6% in FY22. 
 Multiple growth drivers: iPhone 15/MR, auto tier-1 biz and overseas 
expansion. 
As 
the major 
OEM/component 
supplier 
of 
Apple’s 
iPhone/Airpods/Watch, we believe Luxshare will benefit from Apple’s 
iPhone 15 cycle in 3Q23 and continue share gain in top module/OEM in 
FY23E. In addition, we expect Luxshare will expand into OEM biz for Apple’s 
first-gen MR device in 2H23E (500k in FY23E), and gradually ramp up 
OEM/component share allocation in FY24/25E. Benefiting from Apple’s 
supply chain expansion strategy, Luxshare plans to accelerate capacity 
expansion for CE/auto components in Vietnam and Mexico. As auto tier-1 
business and communications segment is set to deliver stable growth post-
integration and overall profitability continues to improve in FY23/24E, we 
forecast earnings will grow 33%/24% YoY in FY23/24E. 
 Attractive risk/reward; Reiterate BUY. We believe Luxshare’s operating 
efficiency will continue to improve with economies of scale in iPhone/ 
Macbook/iPad OEM/components, and new opportunities in auto tier-1 and 
AR/VR will boost revenue upside in FY24/25E. The stock now trades at 
15.2x FY23E P/E, close to 1-SD below 5-year hist. avg P/E. Reiterate BUY 
with new TP of RMB48.0 based on lowered 28x FY23E P/E for softer 
consumer electronics market. Catalysts include iPhone share gain, Apple 
MR launch and auto tier-1 business progress.

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY with new TP of RMB 48.0 (84% upside) 
We derived our new 12m TP of RMB 48.0 based on lowered 28x FY23E P/E (vs 30x prior for soft consume electronics 
market). We believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver strong earnings growth, market share gain and 
product expansion to capture Apple and NEV opportunities in next 3-5 years.   
Upcoming catalysts include share gain in Apple products, MR device launch and auto tier-1 progress. Major risks include 
weaker iPhone/AirPods demand, weaker yield improvement and slower integration of acquired businesses.
