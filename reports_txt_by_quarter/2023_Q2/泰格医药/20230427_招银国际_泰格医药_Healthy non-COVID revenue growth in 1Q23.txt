Tigermed (300347 CH) 
 
 
 
Healthy non-COVID revenue growth in 1Q23 
 
Tigermed reported 1Q23 revenue of RMB1,805mn, down 0.7% YoY, and 
attributable recurring net income of RMB381mn, up 0.7% YoY. 1Q23 revenue / 
attributable recurring net income accounted for 21.2%/ 19.2% respectively of 
our 2023 full-year estimates, which were in line with its historical average level. 
1Q23 revenue would grow by 27-28% YoY if excluding COVID related revenue. 
Gross profit margin (GPM) in 1Q23 was 39.7%, improving by 1.6ppt QoQ and 
0.8ppt YoY, thanks to the decreased proportion of revenue from COVID-19 
related projects (including pass-through revenue to overseas sub-contractors) 
as well as business normalization in China since Feb 2023. According to 
management, GPM would be above 41% if excluding COVID pass-through 
revenue. New orders signed in 1Q23 was largely flat YoY, while management 
expects a significant pickup in new orders growth from 2Q23 given the recovery 
of requests for proposal since 1Q23.  
 Operation fully resumed after the COVID pandemic, laying a sound 
foundation for full-year growth. Management indicated that COVID 
infection among employees had disrupted business operations in Jan 2023, 
with China-based laboratory services taking the most hit. According to 
Frontage (1521 HK), revenue declined by 1.8% YoY while adjusted net profit 
dropped by 77% YoY in 1Q23. With business operation resumed normal, 
management expected both revenue and GPM to see sequential 
improvements in 2Q23. 
 Globalization remains a business focus. Tigermed acquired a Croatia-
based clinical CRO, Marti Farm, in Jan 2023, further enhancing its service 
capability in Europe. The Company is integrating its BD team in Europe to 
enhance BD capabilities. In the US, Tigmerd aims to double its local clinical 
operation team to over 100 staff in 2023. The Company’s strategies in 
Europe and US include collaborating with small- to mid- sized clients with 
relatively inadequate access to resource of global clinical CROs and 
Chinese clients going to developed markets. Additionally, Tigermed takes a 
proactive approach in Southeast Asia and Latin America. Such regions are 
potential end markets for Chinese drug developers, which will create 
additional demand for Tigermed in overseas market. 
 Operating cash flow to recover. Net operating cash flow substantially 
declined by 91% YoY to RMB29mn, due to 1) delay in part of cost payment 
from 4Q22 to 1Q23 due to COVID outbreak; 2) sizable income from COVID 
vaccine projects in 1Q22 which caused a high base; and 3) the increasing 
staff cost due to the growing employee number. Management guided net 
operating cash flow to rebound from 2Q23.  
 Maintain BUY. We revised our TP from RMB134.24 to RMB123.50, based 
on a 10-year DCF model (WACC: 10.6%, terminal growth: 3.0%), to factor 
in slower revenue growth projection. We forecast Tigermed’s revenue to 
grow 15.4%/ 25.0%/ 24.1% YoY and attributable recurring net income to grow 
21.8%/ 25.0%/ 25.3% YoY in FY23E/ 24E/ 25E, respectively.
