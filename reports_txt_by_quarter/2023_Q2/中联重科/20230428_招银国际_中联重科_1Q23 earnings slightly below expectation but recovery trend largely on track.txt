Zoomlion (000157 CH) 
 
 
 
1Q23 earnings slightly below expectation but 
recovery trend largely on track  
 
Zoomlion’s net profit in 1Q23 dropped 11% YoY to RMB810mn, below our 
expectation but due largely to fx loss. On the positive side, Zoomlion delivered 
revenue growth of 4% in 1Q23, the first YoY growth since 2Q21, driven by 123% 
YoY increase in overseas revenue. Besides, gross margin expanded 6.3ppt 
YoY and 2.2ppt QoQ to 26.3%. We expect a gradual recovery of construction 
machinery demand over the coming months. Maintain BUY with TP of RMB7.30.  
 1Q23 results highlights. Revenue grew 4% YoY to RMB10.4bn. Gross 
margin reached 26.4% (the highest level in two years), driven by the decline 
in raw material cost and improvement in production efficiency.  
Administrative expense ratio increased 0.6ppt YoY to 5.4%. R&D expense 
ratio increased 1.9ppt YoY to 6.2%. Net finance expense was RMB124mn, 
versus net finance income of RMB6mn in 1Q22, as a result of the 
recognition of fx loss. Effective tax rate dropped 1.1ppt to 9.1%. Net profit 
dropped 11% YoY to RMB810mn, representing 22% of our full year forecast 
(run rate in 1Q22: 39%). Operating cash inflow dropped 52% YoY to 
RMB286mn.   
 Maintain BUY. Our TP of RMB7.3 is based on 17x 2023E P/E (1SD above 
the average of 12.5x since the upcycle starting 2019; up from 0.5SD 
previously). We believe our target valuation is not excessive given (1) the 
potential earnings recovery; (2) the peak valuation reached 23x in the past.   
 Major risk factors. (1) Unexpected slowdown on infrastructure spending; 
(2) Weaker-than-expected property construction; (3) Risks of new business 
expansion; (4) Rebound of steel price.
