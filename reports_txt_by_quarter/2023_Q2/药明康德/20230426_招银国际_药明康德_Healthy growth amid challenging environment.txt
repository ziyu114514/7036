WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
Healthy growth amid challenging environment 
 
Healthy earnings growth in 1Q23. WuXi AppTec reported 1Q23 revenue of 
RMB8,964mn, up 6% YoY. It posted attributable recurring net income of 
RMB1,869mn, up 9% YoY, and attributable adjusted non-IFRS net income of 
RMB2,342mn, up 14% YoY. 1Q23 revenue / adjusted Non-IFRS net income 
accounted for 21%/ 22% of our 2023 full-year estimates, which were also in line 
with its historical range. Non-IFRS gross profit margin (GPM) improved by 3.2ppt 
to 41.0% while non-IFRS net profit margin increased by 1.9ppt to 26.1% in 1Q23, 
driven by the continuously improved operating efficiency and output per 
employee. Non-COVID business saw resilient growth in 1Q23 with D&M revenue 
(in WuXi Chemistry segment) up 30% YoY. Given the high revenue base of 2022, 
management reiterated 5-7% YoY and 12-14% YoY growth target for its revenue 
and non-IFRS gross profit respectively in 2023E.   
 Global healthcare funding slow-down remains a key factor to be 
watched. According to VBDATA, global/ China healthcare funding decreased 
by 41%/ 57% YoY in 1Q23, following the decline of 43%/ 54% YoY in 2022. 
Although some small- to mid-sized pharmaceutical companies were forced to 
re-assess their R&D spending, R&D demand from top-tier biotech companies 
and big pharma companies remained at relatively healthy levels, in our view. 
We believe top CXO players such as WuXi AppTec will be less impacted by 
the demand cycle thanks to its superior client mix and strong bargaining 
power to clients. In fact, WuXi AppTec’s 1Q23 revenue from biotech clients 
surged by 53% YoY, with over 310 new clients added in the quarter. 
 New modalities services turning into new growth drivers. Revenue of 
new modalities-related services in WuXi Chemistry segment grew by 44% 
YoY to RMB540mn in 1Q23, representing ~9.6% (vs ~10.4% in 2022) of 
segment revenue (excluding COVID-19 commercial projects). Moreover, new 
modalities revenue of WuXi Biology segment delivered a 40% YoY growth in 
1Q23, representing 25.3% (vs 22.5% in 2022) of segment revenue. The 
Company has built the largest drug discovery team in the world, functioning 
as a critical project source for its downstream services. More synergies 
among its various business segments are yet to be released. 
 WuXi ATU and DDSU saw encouraging progress despite business 
adjustments. Pipeline of WuXi ATU included eight projects in Ph3 as of 
1Q23, with two in BLA review stage and another two in BLA preparation 
stage. Management expect to see commercial demand rise in 2H23E with 
anticipated BLA approvals. With the adjustment of Lingang site, management 
indicated GPM of WuXi ATU to turn positive for full-year 2023E. Additionally, 
a customer of DDSU segment obtained marketing approval for a new COVID 
drug in Mar 2023, which may contribute additional royalty income. 
 Maintain BUY. We cut TP from RMB121.52 to RMB 110.69, based on a 10-
year DCF model with WACC of 11.57% and terminal growth of 3.0%, to reflect 
uncertainties in healthcare funding. We forecast WuXi AppTec’s revenue to 
grow by 5.8%/ 28.8%/ 25.8% YoY and adjusted non-IFRS net income to grow 
by 9.3%/ 27.4%/ 24.4% YoY in 2023E/ 24E/ 25E, respectively.
