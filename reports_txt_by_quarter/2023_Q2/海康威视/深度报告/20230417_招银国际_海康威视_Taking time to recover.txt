Hikvision (002415 CH) 
 
 
 
Taking time to recover 
HOLD (Down) 
Hikvision delivered a weaker than expected FY1Q23 with revenue of 
RMB16.2bn (-2% YoY) and net profit of RMB1.81bn (-21% YoY). Sequential 
improvement in top-line (vs -9% YoY in FY4Q22) and GPM (+1.4 ppts YoY) 
were the bright spots. Hikvision will focus on quality growth in FY23E with better 
control on project profitability, headcount (+10% YoY in FY22, stable in FY23E) 
and opex. We think recent share price rebound has reflected the positives in 
earnings recovery and the RMB2.0bn share repurchase. Downgrade to HOLD.  
 FY1Q23 miss although revenue decline narrowed and GPM improved. 
Hikvision reported in-line FY22 with revenue of RMB83.17bn (+2% YoY) 
and net profit of RMB12.84bn (-24% YoY). The weakness in net profit was 
due to 1) GPM erosion (-2 ppts YoY to 42.3%) and 2) higher opex (+17% 
YoY) as headcount grew +10% YoY to 58,280. FY1Q23 results remained 
muted with revenue of RMB16.2bn (-2% YoY) and net profit of RMB1.81bn 
(-21% YoY). A sequentially narrowed decline in top-line (-2% YoY vs.  -9% 
YoY in FY4Q22) and GPM improvement (+1.4 pct pts YoY) were yet to 
offset the higher opex (+16% YoY).  
 Positive on the innovative businesses growth prospect but yet to see 
a rebound in PBG/ SMBG/ overseas segments. Post-COVID recovery 
was slower than expected that only EBG (Large Enterprise-focused) 
resumed positive growth in FY1Q23. Rebound in PBG (Public Security), 
SMBG (SME) and overseas business is not in sight yet. That said, we are 
positive on the revenue diversification with innovative businesses (e.g. 
Smart Home AIoT/ Robotics, etc.) revenue contribution rose to 18% in FY22 
vs. 10% in FY20. Non-surveillance business will remain as the core growth 
driver (FY22 revenue grew +22.8% YoY to RMB15.07bn).  
 Focus on quality growth in FY23E. Management believes Hikvision 
business has bottomed out from the pandemic with FY4Q22 being the 
trough. We expect to see sequential improvement in top-line and margin as 
the company focuses on quality growth in FY23E with tighter control on 
project profitability, headcount and opex. We estimate Hikvision net margin 
to improve from 15.4% in FY22 to 17.7% in FY23E. 
 Lack near-term catalysts, downgrade to HOLD. We trimmed FY23-24E 
net profit by 7-9% to reflect a slow recovery from COVID. Share price has 
rebounded by 66% since its bottom in Oct 2022. We think the existing price 
level has reflected the near-term positives (earnings recovery and the 
RMB2bn share repurchase is completed). Downgrade to HOLD with new 
target price of RMB47.29, based on higher 27x (prior 20x) FY23E P/E, in-
line with 3-year mean as business bottomed out from COVID.

Valuation  
Hikvision (002415 CH, HOLD, TP: RMB47.29) 
We downgrade Hikvision from BUY to HOLD with new target price of RMB47.29 (prior 
RMB37.44). We derived our target price from higher 27x (prior 20x) FY23E P/E, in-line with 
its three-year mean. We use a high multiple as we think business has bottomed out from 
COVID. Also, spin-off of HikRobotics to be listed on A-share should be positive to Hikvision.
