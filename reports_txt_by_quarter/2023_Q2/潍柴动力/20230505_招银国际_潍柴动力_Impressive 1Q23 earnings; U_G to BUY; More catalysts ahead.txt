Weichai Power (000338 CH) 
 
 
 
Impressive 1Q23 earnings; U/G to BUY; More 
catalysts ahead  
 
Weichai’s 1Q23 net profit growth of 68% YoY is above our expectation. We 
believe the impressive earnings growth was driven by the strong operating 
leverage of the HDT engine segment. We are turning more positive on Weichai’s 
recovery story, with new catalysts coming from: (1) the recent sharp decline in 
LNG price (down ~40% since Dec) that will boost the sales of LNG 
trucks/engines, where Weichai has strong presence on; (2) the easing supply 
chain pressure that will help KION achieve strong-than-expected margin 
recovery. All these, together with the continuous growth of engines for 
agricultural machinery and HDT through rising penetration in LOVOL and 
Sinotruk (3808 HK), prompted us to revise up our earnings forecast in 
2023E/24E by 30%/28%. Our SOTP-based TPs for Weichai A/H are revised up 
to RMB13.8/HK$15.8. Given that the H/A discount (currently 11%) has been 
narrowed and is close to the historical average of 12%, we upgrade Weichai-
A to BUY from Hold and maintain BUY on Weichai-H. 
 1Q23 results highlights. Weichai’s revenue of RMB53.4bn in 1Q23 
represented 30%/18% YoY growth, respectively, before/after restatement 
of 1Q22 figures (Note: LOVOL was a JV in 1Q22 as the consolidation took 
place in Jun 2022). We believe the revenue growth in 1Q23 was driven by 
the strong HDT engine sales volume and operating leverage. Gross margin 
was largely stable at 18.7% in 1Q23. With both SG&A and R&D expense 
ratio reduced in 1Q23, net profit surged 77%/68% YoY (before/after 
restatement) to RMB1.86bn. Based on our calculation, the pretax profit 
(excluding KION) surged ~1.6x YoY in 1Q23. Operating cash flow in 1Q23 
substantially improved to -RMB471mn (1Q22: -RMB3.2bn). 
 Weichai’s engine sales outpaced industry in 1Q23. According to 
CICEIA, Weichai's multi-cylinder sales grew ~6% YoY to 183k units in 1Q23 
(vs the industry average of a decline of ~3%), with a market share of ~16%.  
 Decline in LNG price positive to Weichai. LNG price in late Apr has 
declined 40%+ from the peak in Dec 2022. We believe it will potentially 
boost the sales of LNG trucks given the lower operating cost to truck 
owners. We expect Weichai to be a key beneficiary as we estimate Weichai 
has >40% market share in HDT gas engine.     
 Higher earnings guidance for KION Group. KION (45.2% owned by 
Weichai) reported net income of EUR73.5mn in 1Q23 (-8% YoY), largely 
due to higher net finance expense. In the 1Q23 report, KION revised up the 
full year adjusted EBIT target to EUR615mn from EUR500mn due to 
improving supply chains.
