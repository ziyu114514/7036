 Earnings slightly beat. WuXi AppTec reported 2020 revenue of 
RMB16.54bn (+29% YoY) and adjusted non-IFRS net profit of RMB3.56bn 
(+48% YoY), in line with our estimates. By segment, China-based lab service 
and CDMO service continued strong growth momentum, delivering 32% YoY 
and 41% YoY revenue growth, respectively, contributing 52% and 32% of total 
revenue. Affected by the COVID pandemic, US-based lab service income 
declined 3% YoY and clinical research CRO/SMO service growth slowed 
down to 10% YoY. When China-based laboratory services and CDMO 
services maintained stable margins in 2020, US-based laboratory services 
and clinical services experienced 8.7ppts and 9.7ppts gross margin retreat 
due to COVID impact. WuXi AppTec continued to expand its customer base 
and added over 1,300 new customers with total active customers reaching 
4,200, including all of the top 20 global pharmaceutical companies. Based on 
the strong customer demand, WuXi AppTec aims to further grow its employee 
size from 26,411 in 2020 (+21% YoY) to 33,600 (+27% YoY) by 2021E.  
 Seize long-term growth opportunities by accumulating cutting-edge 
expertise. WuXi AppTec aims to invest in new capabilities and capacities, 
such as PROTAC, oligonucleotide, peptide, ADC, bi-specific antibody, cell 
and gene therapies, to capture new business opportunities. WuXi STA 
(subsidiary of WuXi AppTec) and WuXi Biologics plans to form a JV focused 
on ADCs and other drug conjugates. With integrated platform, the JV will 
provide customers end-to-end CDMO services from payloads/linkers, 
antibodies to finished conjugated drug products under one roof. In 2020, the 
Company also launched China-based cell therapy product CTDMO platform 
and AAV adherent and suspension manufacturing platform in China. 
Furthermore, WuXi AppTec will further explore technologies such as AI, 
medical big data and laboratory automation, etc. With technology advantage, 
we believe the Company will continue to gain market share from global market. 
 Strong growth momentum to continue in coming years. We expect China-
based laboratory services will grow strongly driven by capacity expansion and 
growing demand from biotech companies. WuXi AppTec added 575 projects 
to its small-molecule CDMO pipeline in 2020 and its total small-molecule 
CDMO pipeline expanded to over 1,300 active projects, including 28 
commercial projects and 45 ph3 projects. The Company’s cell and gene 
therapy CTDMO projects reached 38 projects (incl. China-based operations), 
of which 2-3 products are expected to file BLA in 2021. The Company 
registered 41% YoY growth in its SMO backlog in 2020 and 48% YoY growth 
in its CDS backlog during the same period. With the ease of the pandemic, 
we expect clinical CRO revenue to see strong recovery in 2021E. 
 Maintain BUY. We revised up the net profit of FY21E/22E by 9%/9%, and 
forecast the net profit to grow 52%/33% YoY in FY21E/22E respectively. 
Moreover, WuXi AppTec’s diversified investment portfolio will bring significant 
investment gains over the long term. We raised our TP to RMB218.88 (WACC 
9.34%; Terminal growth rate 4.00%).
