Shennan announced to expand substrate capacity (200mn FC-BGA, 3mn panel 
RF/FC-CSP) in Guangzhou. Total investment is ~RMB6bn, of which fixed asset 
investment will be over RMB5.8bn (1st/2nd phase: RMB 3.8bn/2bn). We believe 
revenue will start to contribute in FY23/24E. Meanwhile, we are positive on PCB 
demand pick-up in 3Q21E as China 3rd batch of 5G BTS deployment has kicked 
off recently. We raised our TP to RMB101.92 as we rollover to 30x 2022E P/E. 
Maintain HOLD given fair valuation and overhang on margin pressure. 
 
New capacity to capture upcycle of substrate market. Shennan 
announced to expand substrate capacity in Guangzhou production base, 
which will add 200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RF/FC-CSP substrate 
capacity. We expect the new project to contribute revenue in 2023/24E. 
Shennan’s existing substrate capacity has been in full production since last 
year, driven by strong semiconductor demand. We believe strong substrate 
revenue will continue into 2H21E, driving 22% YoY growth in FY21E. 
 
Demand for PCB to pick up in 2H21E. Based on our recent checks, despite 
delay of bidding announcement of China 3rd batch of 5G BTS tenders in 
1H21, China 5G BTS deployment has already kicked off (120k 2.6GHz by 
CM, 320k 3.5GHz/2.1GHz by CU/CT). CM/CBN will also resume its 700MHz 
5G BTS deployment (400k+ in 2 years). This week, CBN has announced the 
tender to transfer its 700MHz frequency band, suggesting that CBN officially 
started the cleanup work for 700MHz BTS deployment. We believe PCB 
demand from telecom equipment providers will pick up in 3Q21E, which will 
drive Shennan’s PCB business to recover in 2H21E.   
 
Near-term cost pressure to continue. 3M LME copper price is currently at 
$9,488/tonne, slightly down 8% from its previous new high. Although material 
cost pressure has hindered willingness in production (especially for low-
margin consumer products), we expect material cost pressure to continue in 
near term. In the long run, we believe top PCB players will enjoy scale benefits 
and Shennan will gain share with accelerated industry consolidation.  
 
Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB101.92. We raised our TP to 
RMB101.92 as we rollover to 30.0x FY22E P/E (vs 30x FY21E prior). We 
maintain HOLD given rich valuation and margin overhang.

Valuation 
Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB101.9 
We maintain HOLD and raised TP to RMB101.9 as we rollover to 30.0x FY22E P/E (vs 30x 
FY21E P/E prior). Upcoming catalysts include further details of 3rd phase of 5G BTS 
tenders.  
Risks include 1) continued price increase in upstream materials, 2) de-spec of 5G BTS and 
ASP pressure and 3) slower than expected 5G deployment.
