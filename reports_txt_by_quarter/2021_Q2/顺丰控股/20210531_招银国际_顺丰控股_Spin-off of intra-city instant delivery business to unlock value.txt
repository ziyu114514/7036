What’s new? SF announced last Friday the plan to spin off the intra-city instant 
delivery business on HKEX. Dada Nexus (DADA US, NR), a major peer, is trading 
at 5x 2021E EV/Sales, and we estimate the valuation of SF’s intra-city business 
attributable to SF can potentially reach RMB23.5bn, representing ~8% of the 
current market cap. We believe a successful separate listing will help SF unlock 
value. 
 Target to be spun off. SF’s intra-city instant delivery business is conducted 
through Hangzhou SF Intra-City (杭州顺丰同城实业). At present, SF has an 
equity interest of 66.76% in Hangzhou SF. At as end-2020, SF’s intra-city 
instant delivery business covered 500 cities in China with riders reaching 2mn.   
 Key financials of Hangzhou SF. According to the latest announcement of 
SF, Hangzhou SF generated RMB4.84bn revenue in 2020 (different from the 
intra-city revenue of RMB3.15bn stated in 2020 annual report as internal 
revenue is included). Net loss in 2020/1Q21 was RMB760mn/RMB210mn. As 
at Mar 2021, the net asset of Hangzhou SF was RMB2.1bn.  
 Estimated valuation. Based on our back-of-the-envelope calculation (due to 
limited financial information available), the valuation of Hangzhou SF 
attributable to SF can potentially reach RMB23.5bn (based on 5x 2021E 
EV/sales, assuming revenue growth of 50% in 2021E).   
 Maintain HOLD. We expect continuous spending on business transformation 
and fierce competition will put pressure on earnings in the near-term, despite 
our long-term positive stance on SF’s unique infrastructure network and good 
management execution.  
 Upside risks: (1) Better-than-expected earnings recovery in 2H21E; (2) 
recovery of parcel shipment ASP. Downside risks: (1) prolonged price war; 
(2) further increase in operating cost; (3) higher-than-expected spending on 
new business development.

Valuation  
Our new TP is unchanged at RMB77, based on 55x 2022E P/E (38% above historical 
average) as we believe SF deserves a valuation premium, due to its scarcity value in 
infrastructure 
and 
network, 
diversifying 
revenue 
stream 
and 
transforming 
to 
data/technology-driven business model.
