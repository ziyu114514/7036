SANY Heavy (600031 CH) 
 
 
 
2024 earnings inline; Emerging markets remain 
the key focus 
 
SANY Heavy (SANY) net profit in 2024 came in at RMB5.97bn (+32% YoY), 
which is 0%/-2% versus our/Bloomberg consensus estimates. The proposed 
dividend implies a 51% pay-out ratio (up from 41% in 2023), which is the highest 
since 2017. During the post-results call, SANY revealed that emerging markets 
such as Asia Pacific, Africa, the Middle East and South America will be the key 
focus, while it remained cautious on the US & Europe market due to geopolitics. 
Management also highlighted the potential of large-size/mining excavators 
going forward. We maintain our view that SANY remains the best proxy to play 
the upcycle of excavators. We slightly revise up our 2025E/26E earnings 
forecast by 5/7%. Accordingly, we revise up our TP to RMB22 (from RMB21), 
based on an unchanged target P/E of 24x (equivalent to 0.5SD above the 
average of 20x since 2017). Our above-average multiple is to reflect the 
earnings upcycle. Maintain BUY.  
 4Q24 results highlights. Revenue grew 12% YoY to RMB20bn. Gross 
margin slightly contracted 4.2ppt YoY to 21.4%, while S&D expense ratio 
fell 5.4ppt YoY to 3.9%, largely due to a change in accounting treatment 
(warranty expense was included in COGS instead of S&D expenses). 
Administrative expense ratio increased 1.1ppt YoY to 5.1%, while R&D 
expense ratio dropped 1.5ppt YoY to 7.6% (a continuous YoY reduction 
trend since late 2022). EBIT grew 9% YoY to RMB760mn. Net profit surged 
1.3x to RMB1.1bn, helped by other income and FX gains. For the full year 
in 2024, net profit grew 32% YoY to RMB5.97bn. Operating cash inflow 
surged 1.6x YoY to RMB14.8bn.  
 Overseas revenue grew 12% in 2024 (64% of total revenue). In terms of 
region, Africa surged 44% YoY to RMB5.3bn (11% of overseas revenue); 
Asia Pacific (ex-China) grew 15% YoY to RMB20.6bn (42%); Europe grew 
2% YoY to RMB2.3bn (25%); America grew 7% YoY to RMB10.3bn (21%). 
Overseas gross margin was 29.7%, higher than the 21% in China.      
 Outlook: SANY will continue to expand the overseas sales network and 
after-sales service capability. SANY sees potential sales growth of 20% in 
markets such as the Middle East, Asia Pacific and Africa. South America is 
another key market with potential sales growth of 25%. In terms of capacity, 
SANY is considering capacity expansion in Brazil.
