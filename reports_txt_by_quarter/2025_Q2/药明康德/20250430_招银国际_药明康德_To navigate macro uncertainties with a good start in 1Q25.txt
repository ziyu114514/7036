WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
To navigate macro uncertainties with a good start in 1Q25 
 
WuXi AppTec reported impressive 1Q25 financial results. Revenue increased by 
21.0% YoY to RMB9.65bn, with revenue from continuing operations rising by 
23.1% YoY to RMB9.39bn. Adjusted non-IFRS net profit surged by 40.0% YoY to 
RMB2.68bn. Both revenue and net profit continued the quarterly improvement 
trend seen throughout 2024, which further accelerated significantly in 1Q25. As 
of the end of 1Q25, the Company’s backlog grew by 47.1% YoY to RMB52.33bn. 
Despite ongoing macro uncertainties, mgmt. has reaffirmed its full-year guidance, 
projecting a 10–15% YoY increase in revenue from continuing operations and 
expansion in the adjusted non-IFRS net profit margin. 
 TIDES business gained momentum with strong growth. WuXi AppTec’s 
TIDES business experienced strong growth 1Q25, with revenue soaring 
187.6% YoY to RMB2.24bn, an acceleration from the 70.1% growth in 2024. 
According to mgmt., the growth was driven by the ramp-up of new capacities 
and contributions from oral GLP-1 programs. TIDES backlog more than 
doubled, increasing by 105.5% YoY as of 1Q25, providing a solid foundation 
for sustained growth. The Company remains on track to expand its peptide 
capacity to over 100k liters by the end of 2025. Hence, Mgmt. continued to 
expect TIDES revenue to grow more than 60% YoY in 2025. 
 Early-stage business remained under pressure with signs of moderate 
recovery. Revenue from Biology segment grew 8.2% YoY in 1Q25, marking a 
second consecutive quarter of positive growth, indicating a recovery in client 
demand for drug discovery services. In Chemistry segment, small-molecule drug 
discovery revenue declined 7.1% YoY, an improvement from the 28.7% YoY 
drop in 2024. Testing segment remained affected by pricing pressure. Lab testing 
revenue slid 4.9% YoY (vs. -8.0% YoY in 2024), with safety assessment revenue 
falling 7.8% YoY (vs. -13.0% YoY in 2024). Mgmt. noted that pricing appeared to 
have reached a trough, although a meaningful recovery will still take time. 
 Strengthening shareholder returns amid market uncertainties. WuXi 
AppTec’s Board of Directors has proposed a series of shareholder return 
initiatives, including maintaining a 30% annual cash dividend payout ratio, 
issuing a one-time RMB1bn special dividend in 2025, introducing the interim 
dividend plan in 2025, and repurchasing and cancelling RMB1bn A-shares 
(announced on March 17). In addition, the Company announced a second 
RMB1bn A-share repurchase and cancellation plan on April 8, which has now 
commenced. Combined, the proposed dividends and share repurchase 
programs total nearly RMB6bn, equivalent to 62% of 2024 attributable net 
profit, underscoring WuXi AppTec’s strong commitment to shareholder return. 
 Maintain BUY. Due to the macro uncertainties such as the US-China trade 
war, we revise down forecasts and now expect revenue from continuing 
operation business to grow by 13.3%/14.9%/15.9% YoY and adjusted non-
IFRS net income to grow by 9.7%/17.5%/15.9% YoY in 2025E/ 26E/ 27E, 
respectively (previously: 14.4%/15.2%/16.3% and 11.7%/19.0%/+16.1% 
YoY). We thus cut our DCF-based TP from RMB94.05 to RMB77.22 (WACC: 
9.42%, terminal growth: 2.00%; both unchanged). Our estimates are higher 
than Bloomberg consensus, reflecting our confidence in earnings resilience.
