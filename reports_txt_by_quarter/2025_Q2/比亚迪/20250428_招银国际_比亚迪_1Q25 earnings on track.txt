1Q25 earnings on track

Maintain BUY. We are of the view that BYD’s 1Q25 results, including all the 
key metrics, continued to show its high earnings quality, despite the ongoing 
vehicle model transition. We believe both sales volume and gross margin in 
1Q25 are on track to achieve our full-year forecasts. New models, including the 
Han L, Tang L and Titanium 3, could boost its sales from 2Q25. Although it is 
possible for BYD to lead another round of price war in 2H25 to maintain its 
market share, we believe its high earnings quality could help keep its net profit 
per vehicle above RMB10,000. 
 Net profit of RMB9,148 per vehicle in 1Q25. BYD’s 1Q25 net profit of 
RMB9.2bn was in line with its preliminary announcement of RMB8.5bn-
10bn. Gross margin of 20.1% was in line with our prior forecast. R&D 
expenses of RMB14.2bn in 1Q25 were about RMB1.5bn higher than our 
projection, which was offset by lower selling expenses and higher forex 
gains than we had expected. 
 Both sales volume and gross margin in 1Q25 are on track to achieve 
our full-year forecasts. We are of the view that BYD’s 1Q25 sales volume 
is on track to meet our full-year forecast of 5.25mn units. Its 1Q25 gross 
margin of 20.1% despite rising discounts for inventory clearance of old 
models is also close to our full-year forecast of 19.7%, taking extra costs 
from ADAS into consideration. It is also possible for BYD to lead another 
round of price war in 2H25 given its current inventory level, in our view. 
Although we do not expect ADAS functions equipped on the Model Year 
2025 vehicles to bring significant new demand, BYD’s comprehensive 
model line-up, leading cost reduction capabilities and new technologies, 
especially those related to batteries, could make itself well positioned in 
maintaining its market share in FY25. Overseas sales volume of 0.2mn 
units (or 20% of total sales volume) in 1Q25 also exceeded our prior 
expectation. 
 Earnings/Valuation. We fine-tune our FY25E earnings forecast by 
lowering average selling price slightly and raising R&D expenses and forex 
gains a bit, which results in an unchanged net profit of RMB57.5bn. We 
have also added our FY27E earnings forecasts. We maintain our BUY 
rating and target price of HK$470 for H share and RMB440 for A share, 
both of which are still based on 23x (unchanged) our FY25E EPS. Key 
risks to our rating and target price include lower sales or margins than we 
expect, and a sector de-rating.
