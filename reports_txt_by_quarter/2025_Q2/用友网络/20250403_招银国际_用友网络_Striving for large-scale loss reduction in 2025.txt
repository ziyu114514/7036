Yonyou (600588 CH) 
 
 
 
Striving for large-scale loss reduction in 2025  
 
Yonyou hosted (2 April) an earnings conference call following its 2024 annual 
results. In 2024, Yonyou’s total revenue reached RMB9.2bn, down 7% YoY, 
owing to postponed customer demand amid macro headwinds, and Yonyou’s 
strategy to promote the subscription business model with greater intensity. Net 
loss attributable to ordinary shareholders expanded to RMB2.1bn in 2024 (2023: 
RMB967mn), mainly due to: 1) the decline in revenue generation; 2) 
compensation provided to the employees that have left their jobs; and 3) 
provisions for goodwill impairment. Management guided to strive for large-scale 
loss reduction in 2025 through improving labour productivity and improving the 
quality and efficiency of product delivery. Although we remain positive that 
Yonyou will benefit from increasing digitalization demand nationwide over the 
long term, and think the international expansion plan should help revive revenue 
growth in the coming years, we remain cautious in the near term. The 40% rise 
in its stock price YTD has largely priced in positive market sentiment regarding 
incremental benefits brought by the “DeepSeek moment”, in our view, and 
concrete evidence on incremental monetization from AI is the next key to watch 
to drive a further rerating. We lift our TP to RMB14.49 (was RMB9.08) based on 
5.3x 2025E EV/sales, in line with its two-year average.  Maintain HOLD.  
 Solid progress made in large enterprise customer acquisition. By the 
end of 2024, Yonyou recorded 7 new contract wins from central state-owned 
enterprises, bringing the total number of contract wins to 44. Revenue 
generation from the core BIP3 product reached RMB3.14bn in 2024, and its 
revenue contribution to total revenue was up by 2.4ppts YoY. The overall 
subscription revenue growth of 26% YoY was also higher than that of total 
revenue, demonstrating an improvement in revenue structure. Subscription 
related contract liabilities reached RMB2.31bn in 2024, up 25.9% YoY.  
 High R&D capitalization rate remains a concern. In 2024, Yonyou’s R&D 
expenditure came in at RMB2.1bn, flat YoY, which in our view demonstrated 
Yonyou’s effort in optimizing cost while maintaining investment to drive 
product feature enhancement. However, R&D capitalization rate rose to a 
record high of 52% (vs. 48/50% in 2022/2023, compared to Kingdee’s 32% 
in 2024). Although Yonyou suspended the disclosure of ARR contribution in 
2024, it needs to improve ARR contribution and further optimize R&D 
capitalization, to drive a better long-term profitability outlook, in our view. 
The number of employees for Yonyou was 21,283, down 3,666 YoY (or 15% 
YoY), and we expect the improvement in labor productivity to help drive 
better operating efficiency ahead.  
 Maintain HOLD with a new TP of RMB14.49. We lower 2025E and 2026E 
revenue forecast both by 18% to factor in slower-than-expected revenue 
growth in both large-sized enterprises and mid-sized enterprises. However, 
our TP is lifted to RMB14.49 based on 5.3x 2025E EV/sales (previously 
RMB9.08 on 3.1x 2024E EV/sales), in line with its two-year average, to 
factor in the industrywide rerating trend brought by more positive sentiment 
on AI-related monetization.
