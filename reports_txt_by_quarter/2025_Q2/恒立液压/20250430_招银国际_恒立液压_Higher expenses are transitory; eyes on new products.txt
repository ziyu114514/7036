CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH) 
 
 
 
Higher expenses are transitory; eyes on new 
products   
 
Hengli’s reported net profit in 4Q24 /1Q25 was -4% YoY /+3% YoY and came 
in slightly lower than our expectation due to higher administrative expenses. 
That said, the higher expenses were due to the booking of depreciation of 
Mexico production plant and precision business (ball screws and linear motion) 
as a result of the transfer of construction-in-progress to fixed assets. We fine-
tune our 2025E/26E earnings forecast by -2%. We are staying positive on Hengli 
and revise up our TP to RMB92 (previously: RMB64), based on 35x 2025E P/E 
(equivalent to historical average + 1SD) as: (1) we roll over our valuation to 
2025E, and (2) we believe humanoid robots components such as ball screws 
will serve as the important growth driver in the medium term. Maintain BUY.   
 Key highlights in 2024 results: Revenue in 2024 grew 5% YoY to 
RMB10bn (1%/10%/2%/2% growth of hydraulic cylinders / pump & valve / 
hydraulic systems / components). Blended gross margin expanded 1.4ppt 
YoY to 42.6%, driven by hydraulic cylinders. EBIT, however, was flat YoY 
largely due to a 1.8ppt YoY increase in administrative expense ratio (to 
6.3%). Net profit was RMB2.5bn, stable YoY. In 4Q24, net profit dropped 
4% YoY to RMB717mn, due to a 7% YoY decline in revenue and higher 
administrative expense ratio (+3.4ppt to 8.7%).  
 Key highlights in 1Q25 results: EBIT dropped 9% YoY to RMB579mn, as 
the 3% YoY increase in revenue was offset by 0.7ppt YoY contraction of 
gross margin (to 39.4%) and an increase in expense ratio in general. Helped 
by a 2.6x YoY increase in net finance income, net profit in 1Q25 grew 3% 
YoY to RMB618mn, which accounted for 21% of our full-year estimates (run 
rate in 1Q24: 22%).  
 Potential reduction of segment loss in 2025E. We understand that the 
loss attributable to Mexico production plant and precision business was 
~RMB100mn, due to the depreciation of newly-added fixed assets. Hengli 
sees chances of loss reduction in 2025E when product delivery increases.  
 Outlook on ball screws. The current annual capacity of ball screws is 
enough to support production value of RMB700-800mn. Hengli targets to 
increase the capacity to RMB2bn, equivalent to ~100k units of ball screws.   
 Risk 
factors: 
(1) further 
weakness in the demand for hydraulic 
components; (2) slower-than-expected new business development
