Access China conference highlights
Growth to continue till 2020
Mr. Bo Li, Deputy General Manager and Secretary of Tianqi Lithium's Board of
Directors, attended our 2018 dbAccess China conference in Beijing this week. Mr.
Li shared his view on industry development and the company’s expansion plan
for Tianqi. We summarize below the key highlights from the investor meetings.
Maintain Hold.
Expect relatively resilient pricing for high-quality battery grade lithium
compounds in 2018
The battery grade lithium carbonate price corrected by RMB5k/t from its peak at
over RMB170k/t by end-2017, but Tianqi does not expect meaningful correction of
lithium compound pricing due to a supply shortage of high-quality battery grade
lithium compounds with high purity levels. The company believes the incremental
supply from brine extraction in Tibet/Qinghai will be limited, as several issues
need to be resolved : a) utilities and infrastructure , b) access to pure water, c)
extraction diﬃculties in high altitude, and d) SOE ownership in mining rights.
Better margin performance compared to industry peers
Tianqi exhibits a superior gross margin at 70% vs. other industry players due to:
a) in-house high quality spodumene supply from the Greenbushes mine, b) high
exposure in battery grade lithium compounds, which charges a pricing premium
compared to industrial grade or subpar battery grade lithium compounds, and
c) onshore lithium pricing premium at RMB10-20k/t in China due to strong end
demand. As the quality of battery grade lithium compounds is directly linked
to the stability and performance of lithium batteries, Tianqi believes lithium
compound converters that can provide meaningful and stable volume output will
be the major beneﬁciaries riding the EV tide.
Kwinana expansion in Western Australia to fuel production volume growth till
2020
The 24ktpa Kwinana phase 1 lithium hydroxide plant is on track to commence
production by YE18 with spodumene ore grading at 2.4%, with the utilization rate
expected to reach 80% in 8-10 months after commencement and full capacity
in 24 months. Another 24ktpa lithium hydroxide plant in Kwinana phase 2 is
scheduled to complete construction by YE19 with spodumene ore grading at
1.7%. Coupled with the 20ktpa lithium carbonate capacity addition in Suining,
Tianqi targets the company’s total processing capacity to reach 110ktpa in

2020, and lithium compound production volume to surpass 80kt (on LCE basis),
implying a 3-year CAGR of near 40% from 32kt in 2017.
Open to asset acquisition opportunities overseas
Although the annual volume of Greenbushes’ spodumene should nearly double
to 1.34mt in 2019 from 740kt this year, the in-house spodumene volume might
not be fully suﬃcient for Tianqi in 2020. The scheduled rapid production ramp-up
has compelled the company to continually look for high-quality lithium resources
overseas. After SQM turned down outside oﬀers, Tianqi’s 2.1% SQM stake is
currently considered to be a ﬁnancial investment only. The company will seek
more brine-based opportunities, potentially in South America.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
