Access China conference highlights
Shenzhen Inovance attended our Access China Conference 2018 on 8 January in
Beijing. Below, we summarize our key takeaways from the investor meetings:
IA: a strong 2017; high growth likely to be sustained in 2018
■
General IA products (i.e., inverter and servo): Total new orders for
general inverter were up around 50% YoY in 2017 and management
expects 40% revenue growth in 2018. Meanwhile, new orders for general
servo rose >100% YoY in 2017 and the company is guiding for a YoY
revenue growth range of 50-60% in 2018. Key growth drivers include: 1)
broad-based manufacturing upgrades in China that require higher energy
eﬃciency and precision, beneﬁting the demand for inverter and servos;
and 2) continued market share gains through its "vertical-based" sales
strategy, coupled with customization.
■
Specialized IA products (i.e., integrated elevator drive and PIMM
servo): Total new orders for integrated elevator drive were up 15%
YoY (revenue recognition likely in a range of 10-15%) as Inovance starts
to increase its penetration in foreign brands (European and US brands
in particular) while further strengthening its dominant position in local
brands (70% market share). Revenue growth for this product is expected
to remain at double digits in 2018. For PIMM servo, new orders were
up 40% YoY, mainly driven by the additional contribution from servo
motors, which the company started to sell in 2017. Growth would have
been single digit on a like-for-like basis (i.e., excluding motors). For 2018,
management is guiding for revenue growth of 20-30% YoY for PIMM
servo (vs. projected industry growth of single digits).
NEV: logistics NEV to become the key growth driver in 2018
■
Logistics NEV: Inovance estimates that its market share in China's
logistics NEV drive market reached 40% in 2017, with customers covering
eight out of the top 10 logistics NEV producers in China. For 2018,
management expects sales of logistics NEV to reach 150,000 units from
2017's 80,000 units (c.+90% YoY). On top of this, the company expects
its share in the drive market to continue increasing in 2018.
■
NEV bus: The revenue contribution from NEV bus drive is estimated to
have dropped to 60% of the NEV segment in 2017 vs. 90% in 2016.
Moreover, the exclusive supply agreement with Yutong is due to be

renewed by end-2018 and management expects the negotiation to kick
oﬀ soon with results likely coming out in 1H18, along with a price cut for
2018. Preliminary assessment of the current situation suggests Inovance
is inclined to renew the agreement. Overall, management expects the
revenue contribution from NEV bus to remain steady in 2018, with the
addition of motor products likely oﬀsetting the drop in controller products.
■
Passenger NEV: Inovance invested half of its R&D expenses in the NEV
segment, with 70-80% allocated to the development of passenger NEV
drive products. Based on the current progress (i.e., it has secured 4-5 NEV
models from tier-2 OEMs and 1 tier-1 OEM in 2017), management expects
total new orders for passenger NEV drives to reach around Rmb100m.
The target for 2018 is to secure more NEV models from tier-1 OEMs.

may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
