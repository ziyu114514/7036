Increasing risk of over supply in 2018
Turning more prudent near-term
We think Moutai's channel restocking cycles could be peaking with expanding
bubbles in its retail pricing recently. As retail prices are (currently at
Rmb1700-1800) approaching the historic peak level (Rmb2000 in 2012), Moutai's
investment demand and real consumption demand could be impacted in 2018,
while supply looks set to increase. As a result, we think oversupply could pressure
real retail prices. Though this won't impact Feitian Moutai's ex-factory sales,
potential weakening in retail prices could pressure market sentiment.
2017: Channel restocking demand is main growth driver
There are two sources of demand for "Feitian Moutai" - real consumption demand
and investment demand. During the retail price hike cycle, real consumption
demand could decline due to price elasticity, and instead, investment demand, or
channel/social restocking demand, would increase, driven by market's price hike
expectation. In 2017, we estimate real consumption demand has declined 10%
yoy to 24,000 tons, and channel/social stocking demand has absorbed 7,000 tons
(compared to releasing 4,000 tons in 2016).
2018: Supply set to increase while demand might decline
As Feitian Moutai's current retail price is approaching its historic peak level, the
expected ROI for channel stocking in 2018 is much lower than in 2017. This should
lead to lower interest by investors and distributors to stock up on the liquor.
Meanwhile, distributors normally have less incentive to stock up inventories after
manufacturers raise ex-factory prices (Moutai announced a raise in price on Dec
2017). On the other hand, real consumption could also decline in 2018 due to the
higher retail price. On the supply side, Moutai has announced it will raise supply
by >7.6% to 28,000 tons. The increasing supply and declining demand might lead
to a potential over supply situation in 2018.
Three potential impacts of over supply
If Moutai enters an over supply situation, the retail price might be under pressure
in near-term. In a softer retail price scenario, the subsequent results could be:
1) distributors/investors further clean up inventories and enhance over supply;
2) weaker sales for super premium products; and 3) weaker demand for "ex-
quota" Feitian volumes. These could pressure its share price in near-term. Besides
this near-term risk, we still like the company for its strong branding and good
positioning in consumers' trading up demand.

Channel restocking demand is main growth driver in 2017
Moutai's demand includes real consumption demand and investment demand.
Moutai's sales value grew by 50% and sales volume grew by 35% in 2017. We
don't think such strong growth can be fully explained by consumers' trading up
demand. Instead, a strong investment demand recovery would be the main driver
in 2017. Speciﬁcally,
■
Investment demand: From 2H16, market began to build up expectations
that Moutai's retail price would continue to rally. With such an
expectation, liquor investors began enter the market, including
distributors, institutions (property developers and cola miners) and high
net wealth individuals. Some consumers also purchased Moutai in
advance to avoid future price hikes. We estimate Moutai's channel
has absorbed 7000 tons of ex-factory volume, representing 23% of
Moutai's ex-factory volume in 2017. (The channel released 4,000 tons
of Moutai to the market in 2016.)
■
Real consumption demand: "Feitian Moutai's average retail price rose
by 50% in 2017 to Rmb1400. After the rally, the liquor became less
aﬀordable for private consumption. During our channel checks, some
distributors also indicated that they were beginning to be concerned
about whether the "corkage ratio" would decline after retail price hike.
As Moutai's private consumption portion has increased since 2012,
we think more consumption is becoming price sensitive. We estimate
Moutai's real consumption to decline 10% yoy to 24,000 tons in 2017
(Figure 2).
The market in 2017 is similar as what the market experienced in Moutai's re-
stocking cycle during 2011. In 2011, the retail price rose from Rmb1300 in
year beginning to Rmb2000 in early 2012. The channel restocking became a key
growth driver and resulted in undersupply in the retail market (Figure 1). (Refer to
our report "The restocking cycle " published on June 22 2017 for more details.)
After recent the restocking cycle in 2016-17, we forecast Moutai's channel/social
inventory to be 13,000 tons by the end of 2017, representing 6 months of its
real consumption (Figure 3).

2018: could enter an over supply situation
If Moutai's retail price remains at current levels, both investment demand and
consumption demand could begin to decline in 2018. In our base case, we
estimate a typical Feitian liquor investor's 1 year expected return to decline
from highest level at Rmb500 in Jan 2017 to Rmb200 in Jan 2018 and the ROI
(expected return/spot market price) to decline from 40% in Jan 2017 to 10% in
Jan 2018 (Figure 3), as cost to build up inventories are rising signiﬁcantly in past
12 months. As a result, we forecast investment demand to decline 50% yoy to
3500 tons. Meanwhile, due to rising retail prices and price elasticity, we forecast
real consumption demand to decline 10% yoy to 22,000 tons. This implies that
total demand would decline 20% yoy to 25,500 tons in 2018 (Figure 2).

Figure 4: What's the expected return to store Moutai for 12 months?
Source:Deutsche Bank; the expected return = expected future retail price in 12 months less spot retail price
Moutai has announced an increase in supply by at least 7% to 28,000 tons in 2018.
We believe this number is referred to "planned volume" before including "ex-
quota" volume. To recap, Moutai's actual volume is 31,000 tons in 2017 including
both planned volume and "out of quota" volume. Yet even based on the "planned
volume" at 28,000 tons, it will be still higher than total demand of 25,000 tons,
result in an over supply situation.
If Moutai enters an oversupply scenario in 2018, various potential events could
pressure market sentiment, including ,
■
Channel de-stocking. If the price hike expectation switches to price
decline expectation, the channel restocking could switch into a
destocking cycle. The incremental supply from channel could enhance
the destocking cycle itself.
■
Weaker demand of super premium Moutai. We forecast that super
premium Moutai, or customized Moutai, contributed 10% sales growth
in 2017. We expect the portion of investment demand is higher for super
premium Moutai than for Feitian Moutai. Therefore, weaker investment
demand could impact super premium Moutai harder.
■
"ex-quota" Feitian volumes might decline. Within over supply situation,
Moutai might reduce its "out of quota" Feitian to support retail price.

We still like Moutai for its long-term solid growth
In the long term, we still expect Moutai to generate solid growth with its strong
branding and increasing channel operating capability. We are maintaining a Buy
on the stock. Our revised target price at Rmb790 is based on DCF methodology,
factoring in 9.5% WACC (3.9% RFR, 5.6% ERP, 1.0 beta, debt-free structure)
and a 2% terminal growth rate. Downside risk: earlier-than-expected channel de-
stocking.

Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its

Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Trade ideas
for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction belief by an
analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of no less than
two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients,
and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the
majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does
not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an
oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
