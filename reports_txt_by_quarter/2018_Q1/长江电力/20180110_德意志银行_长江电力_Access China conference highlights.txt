Access China conference highlights
Yangtze Power attended our AccessChina 2018 conference and we lay out the
key takeaways below:
Power output: The water inﬂow improved much in 2H17 and the total
generation in 2017 was up by 2.4% yoy (vs. 4% decrease in 1H17). Three
Gorges/Gezhouba recorded 4.4%/4.1% generation growth while Xiluodu’s output
remained ﬂattish and Xiangjiaba’s output decreased slightly by 1.2%. According
to the management, there are 6bn kwh power curtailment in 2017 (vs. 210.8bn
kwh total power output) mainly in Xiluodu/Xiangjiaba and management expects it
to decrease going forward. The synchronized dispatching among Yangtze’s four
hydro plants has contributed 9.6bn kwh additional power output in 2017 and
management believes there is still further room to improve.
Tariff updates: Yangtze Power just announced the tariﬀ hike for its Xiluodu/
Xiangjiaba (eﬀective on Jul 2017) due to the mid-year tariﬀ hike for thermal power.
Tariﬀ was raised by Rmb1.9/mwh to Rmb326.3/mwh for Xiluodu (Right) and was
raised by Rmb4.6/mwh to Rmb300.6/mwh for Xiluodu (Left) and Xiangjiaba. Out
of the total 210.8bn kwh power output in 2017, around 12bn kwh is market-based
volume with a price discount of c.Rmb20/mwh.
Capital deployment: Yangtze has budgeted Rmb12bn/year for external
investments for next 2-3 year. They will mainly focus on hydro/power retail sector
in domestic market and are also interested in overseas opportunities in hydro/
power retail/gas power sector.
Other key takeaways: The company is aware of the draft version notice by NDRC
to reduce the VAT for hydro power, but they are still waiting for further oﬃcial
updates on this. Mgmt expects the ﬁnancial cost to drop yoy in 2017 and remain
ﬂattish in 2018 with some reduction in total debt oﬀset by higher eﬀective interest
rate. Yangtze will stick to its dividend policy of no less than Rmb0.65/sh for
2017-20.

act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Trade ideas
for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction belief by an
analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of no less than
two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients,
and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the
majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does
not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an

Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
