We reiterate Buy on Focus Media (FM) and raise our PT by 13.7% to RMB18.2. 
FM’s 2017 bottom-line beat our number by 10% and consensus by 3%, based 
on its preliminary results. We have seen more traditional consumer and 
education companies investing more via FM’s ad channels. In addition, FM has 
operating leverage as its cost of rent for each screen/post frame is fixed. 
2018 outlook: we expect robust growth to continue on further penetration  
We forecast 23% top-line and 25% bottom-line growth in 2018. We have 
noticed internet companies focusing more on lower-tier cities as they 
penetrate China. As a result, FM’s management said that its internet clients are 
requesting screen/post frame penetration in lower-tier cities. We expect post 
frames to increase to 1.6m and LCD screens to increase to 300,000, up c.20% 
yoy. We raise our 2018/2019 earnings forecasts by 11% and 12% to reflect this. 
Internet, FMCG, education and Baijiu seeing high growth 
Internet/FMCG clients such as JD, Ali, Baidu and P&G contributed c. 50% of 
FM’s ad revenue and their growth remains robust as they are paying more 
attention to the inner building and cinema advertisement channels. Our 
channel checks also found strong incremental growth from K12 education and 
Baijiu companies. For example, mgmt said that Baijiu’s advertisement revenue 
was only RMB2-3m in 2016, but it increased 10x to RMB300m in 2017 and is 
likely to double in 2018E. In education, K12 after-school tutoring companies in 
particular are spending more on advertising (for both online and offline classes); 
these include TAL, EDU, DADA abc (哒哒英语) and Zhangmen (掌门一对一). 
Valuation and risks 
Our main valuation method is DCF (9.8% WACC, 3% TGR). FM trades at an ex-
cash PER of 24x (it had RMB3.8bn net cash as of 9M17) on our 2018E earnings 
vs. its 26% three-year earnings CAGR. We view risk-reward as attractive. FM 
paid 80% of its earnings as dividend and mgmt guides for largely unchanged 
payout for FY2017. Risks: 1) more theaters start their own advertising 
businesses; 2) threats from other advertising modes; 3) a slowdown in China’s 
downstream movie industry; 4) a slowdown in internet/FMCG sector growth.

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. 
Trade ideas for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction 
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector over a time frame 
of no less than two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss 
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or 
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, 
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as 
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a 
recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of 
changes in market conditions and in both general and company-specific economic prospects make it difficult to update 
research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department 
Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational 
purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial situations, or needs of 
individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial instruments or to participate in 
any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst’s judgment. The 
financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own 
informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are subject to change without notice, and 
investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and other factors. If a financial instrument is 
denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely affect the 
investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude 
transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the 
previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income 
instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX 
depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by 
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons 
indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency 
that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks 
typical 
to 
options 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax 
position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take 
expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates 
can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market 
factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and 
changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, 
which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the 
currency 
of 
an 
underlying 
security, 
effectively 
assume 
currency 
risk.
