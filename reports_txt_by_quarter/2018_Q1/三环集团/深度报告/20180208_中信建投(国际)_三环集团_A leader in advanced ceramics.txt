A leader in advanced ceramics 
Three-Circle Group takes lead in the production and sales of ceramic-
based optical communications components, alumina ceramic 
substrates and ceramic matrices used in resistors. 
Ceramic chassis. Three-Circle Group is well placed to benefit from the 
would-be introduction of ceramic housing by China’s incumbent “big 
three” smartphone makers, Huawei, Oppo and Vivo, as different from its 
domestic peers, Three-Circle Group is self-sufficient in ceramic powder, 
able to produce 1mn pieces of ceramic chassis per month. 
Multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCC). A dearth of MLCC supply 
estimated to last for at least a year and a half compounded by a surge in 
the prices of palladium, a key ingredient of MLCC, together with 
increasing demand emanating from such burgeoning areas as EV and 
auto electronics and the growing use of passive components for 
smartphones, would spur and sustain a MLCC price upturn, in our view, 
providing tailwinds for Three-Circle Group, whose MLCC division earned 
around RMB100mn in 2016, accounting for 4% of its full-year revenue. 
Ceramic-based optical communications components. With gross margin 
exceeding 50%, the company’s fiber optic ceramic ferrules and sleeves 
business claimed a market share of more than 80% by year-end 2017, up 
from the previous 50%, thanks mainly to a practice of price-cutting since 
the beginning of 2016 on the back of its self-sufficiency in ceramic 
powder and economies of scale. Looking ahead, as 5G deployment is 
imminent which will dial up demand for optical communications 
components, the company may as well make a U-turn in its pricing 
strategy, in our view. 
Electroceramic packaging. Three-Circle Group’s semiconductor devices 
unit (including electroceramic packaging) recorded a 2016 operating 
revenue of RMB600mn, a far cry compared to about RMB14.1bn for that 
of Kyocera. Hence, there is plenty of scope for Three-Circle Group to keep 
up with its arch rival.  
Earnings forecast. We predict Three-Circle Group to have net profit 
attributable to the parent of RMB1.078bn/1.551bn/2.111bn for 2017-
2019, corresponding to EPS of RMB0.62/0.90/1.22 and 35x/24x/18x PER. 
Our six-month target price of RMB29.60 is based on a 33x PER for 2018.

Optical communications components, semiconductor devices, electronic component materials and fuel cell membranes 
constituted the mainstay of Three-Circle Group’s 2016 revenue. 
Ceramic chassis/MLCC 
Ceramic chassis 
Metal as a conductor will absorb or reflect radio waves and thus causes wireless interference. As a result, ceramic and 
glass chassis, which are free of such an off-putting nature while bestowed with properties such as high rigidity and 
excellent surface polish, are gaining in popularity among smartphone makers as the world ushers in the new era of 
wireless charging and 5G.

Global shipments of smartphones came to 1.517bn units in 2017 and look set to reach 1.744bn by 2021, according to 
IDC’s forecast. This could hint at a ceramic chassis market size of RMB31.4bn by 2021 on an assumed penetration rate 
of 30% and a unit price of RMB60.

China as it stands still relies heavily on the import of ceramic powder. But Three-Circle Group is an exception. The 
company possesses proprietary technologies throughout the zirconia powder production process with effective cost and 
yield control, able to produce 1mn pieces of high performance ceramic chassis per month, and is thus best placed to 
benefit from the would-be introduction of ceramic housing by China’s incumbent “big three” smartphone makers, 
Huawei, Oppo and Vivo. 
MLCC 
A dearth of MLCC supply not least from Japanese manufacturers like Murata, the biggest MLCC producer in the world, 
is estimated to last for at least a year and a half. This, compounded by a surge in the prices of palladium, a key ingredient 
of MLCC, together with increasing demands emanating from such burgeoning areas as EV and auto electronics and the 
growing use of passive components for smartphones, would spur and sustain a MLCC price upturn, in our view, providing 
tailwinds for Three-Circle Group, whose MLCC division earned around RMB100mn in 2016, accounting for 4% of its full-
year revenue.

Ceramic-based optical communications components 
We are living in a world where 5G commercialization is approaching fast, FTTH implementations are gathering pace, and 
the DC construction boom is in full charge. These all fire up demand for fiber optic ceramic ferrules, an indispensable 
part of fiber optic connectors. 
China’s fiber optic ceramic ferrules market is the largest in the world, with an output of 2.25bn in 2015 and set to grow 
at a CAGR of 15% to reach 3.434bn by 2018.

Three-Circle Group, already a recognized global leader in fiber optic ceramic ferrules, boasts a client roster of famous 
international fiber optic connector vendors such as TE Connectivity, Amphenol Industrial, HUBER+SUHNER and Radiall. 
With an eye-catching gross margin of above 50%, the company’s fiber optic ceramic ferrules and sleeves business 
claimed a market share of more than 80% by year-end 2017, up from the previous 50%, thanks mainly to a practice of 
price-cutting since the beginning of 2016 on the back of its self-sufficiency in ceramic powder and economies of scale. 
Looking ahead, as 5G deployment is imminent which will dial up demand for optical communications components, the

Electroceramic packaging 
Three-Circle Group is the only manufacturer in China capable of volume production of ceramic packaging for surface-
mount devices (SMDs), a core component of communications and digital products, counting Partron, NDK and Micro 
Crystal as its customers. 
There are only four companies in the world able to mass produce electroceramic packaging, namely, Kyocera, NSSED, 
NTK and Three-Circle Group, with Kyocera having the largest market share and the broadest offering of product 
categories. 
Three-Circle Group’s semiconductor devices unit (including electroceramic packaging) recorded a 2016 operating 
revenue of RMB600mn, a far cry compared to about RMB14.1bn for that of Kyocera. Hence, there is plenty of scope for 
Three-Circle Group to keep up with its arch rival.

R&D-driven innovator 
The global advanced ceramics market reached a size of USD61bn in 2016, significantly up from USD34bn in 2006, and is 
expected to further expand to USD68bn by 2018, according to Roland Berger. 
With such an upbeat picture in mind, Three-Circle Group is proactively opening up new avenues of growth in areas such 
as 5G, biomedicine and environmental protection to achieve sustainable development.  
Like its leading global peers, Three-Circle Group invests more than 3% of its annual operating revenue into R&D, bringing 
out new products every two or three years to bolster earnings growth. The company has established a research institute 
alongside a more than 600-strong R&D team, covering a wide-ranging variety of cutting-edge technologies and futuristic 
subjects.
