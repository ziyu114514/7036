Don't leave the party too early;
reiterating Buy
Entering secular growth cycle
After Wuliangye's 130% share price hike in past 12 month, market has increasing
concerns on whether there is still upside. Our view is positive. We expect the
company to enter a secular growth period in 2018-19, and its earnings to grow
at 29% CAGR in 2018-20, driven by management’s strong incentives for growth
and expanding high end liquor market after Moutai raising price. We revise up
our target price to Rmb98, implying 27x 2018 P/E. We reiterate Buy.
Management has strong incentive to drive sales and improve efficiency
During 1218 distributor meeting, Wuliangye management indicates to achieve
gross sales of Rmb40bn in 2018 and Rmb60bn in 2020 (vs Rmb30bn in 2017E).
Management will invest in channel penetration, brand building and products
streamlining to drive sales growth. Helped by completion of management shares
incentive schemes and strong support from Wuliangye group, we believe the
company could achieve its target.
Moutai’s price hike to release more market for Wuliangye
On Dec 29, Moutai announced to raise ex-factory price by 18% to Rmb969/bottle,
and set retail price at Rmb1499/bottle. As a result, the ex-factory price gap of
Moutai over Wuliangye expands from 10% to 30%. We believe Wuliangye is the
biggest beneﬁciary of the price hike, helped by the expanding high end liquor
market room released by Moutai.
We reiterate Buy; revising up TP to Rmb98
We are revising up our earnings forecast by 13%-42% for 2018-2020 to factor in a
better volume growth, mix upgrade, and margin expansion, and revise up target
price by 40% to Rmb98 based on DCF model. We are changing our valuation
methodology from EV/EBITDA to DCF as we believe DCF model can incorporate
long-term growth and solid cash ﬂow. Downside risk: channel de-stocking in
high-end liquor sector; food safety; worse than expected macro FAI slow down.

Internal driver: management has strong incentive to drive
sales and improve eﬃciency
During 1218 distributor meeting held on December 18, 2017, Wuliangye
management indicates to achieve gross sales of Rmb40bn in 2018 and Rmb60bn
by the end of 13th ﬁve year plan (in 2020). This guidance implies 30% yoy growth
in 2018 compared to Rmb30bn gross sales in 2017E. The company will enhance
its channel, branding and products to achieve the target:
■
In channel, to increase penetration in “a hundreds of city, a thousands
of country, and ten thousands of stores”.
■
In branding, to increase the marketing in all channels and enhance its
leading position in aromatic liquor category.
■
In products, to streamline the SKUs and focus in one main brand (the
mainstream Wuliangye), and three products group targeting at super
premium consumers, young consumers and international consumers.
We believe Wuliangye could achieve its sales growth target in 2018-20. The
measures can transform it from a SOE company to a solid FMCG company
with competitiveness in channels, branding and products. More important,
Wuliangye’s management has strong incentives to achieve the target, given 1)
the company’s management shares scheme has been approved by regulators and
likely to be completed in 2018; 2) 2018 will be the ﬁrst full year of operation since
Mr Liu Shuguang, the Chairman of Wuliangye group, came on board.

External driver: Moutai’s price hike to release more market
room for Wuliangye
On Dec 29, Moutai announced to raise ex-factory price by 18% to Rmb969/bottle,
and raise suggested retail price to Rmb1499/bottle (from Rmb1299/bottle). After
the price adjustment, the ex-factory price gap of Moutai vs. Wuliangye expands
from 10% to 30%, and suggested retail price gap expand from 18% to 36%.

Moutai’s price hike should result in increasing demand for Wuliangye. In the
retail end, the expanding price gap will lead to part of private consumption (which
is price sensitive) switching from Moutai to Wuliangye. Meanwhile, distributors
will have less incentives to store up Moutai after price hike, and therefore left more
cash ﬂow for Wuliangye procurement. We forecast volume growth of premium
Wuliangye to speed up helped by the expanding price gap.

Key takeaways from 1218 distributor meeting
1. Targets Rmb60bn sales in 2020
■
To increase gross sales from Rmb30bn in 2017 to Rmb40bn in 2018. The
key drivers will be double digit volume growth in main stream Wuliangye,
increasing sales from low-end Wuliangye (target to achieve Rmb10bn in
2018), and higher portion of high price Wuliangye.
■
The listed-co: to achieve Rmb60bn sales by the end of 13th ﬁve year plan
(2020), including Rmb40bn for main stream Wuliangye and Rmb20bn
for low end Wuliangye.
■
The group: to achieve Rmb100bn sales by 2020. Management also
shows its conﬁdence in achieving the target earlier than the plan. Liquor
segment will accounts for 2/3 of the total sales.
2. To invest in channels, brandings and products
■
Channels: through “a hundreds of city, a thousands of country, and
ten thousands of stores” program, increase its penetration in blank
regions. By the end of 2017, it has built up 7000 core POS and 1000
Wuliangye specialty stores. It targets to increase to 8000 core POS and
1500 specialty stores in 2018.
■
Branding: to increase investment in online marketing and interactions
with consumers.
■
Products: it will streamline the SKU portfolios and enhance the “1+3”
system. The “1” refers to mainstream Wuliangye. The “3” categories
include 1) super high end portfolios targeting in premium consumers,
i.e. customized Wuliangye and Chinese zodiac Wuliangye; 2) the mild
liquors targeting in younger consumers; and 3) international version of
Wuliangye.
3. Selling expense ratio to stabilize and decline in next few years
■
It will continue to implement comprehensive cost management. Through
detail budget management and cost control, the management expects
selling expense ratio to stabilize and decline in next few years
4. Positive in liquor industry trend in 2018.
■
Management is optimistic and prudent in high end liquor sector, and
believes it could be a bit more optimistic than prudent.
■
The key industry driver will be consumers’ trading up, recovering
macroeconomic, and increasing international demand from “one belt
one road” program.
■
Meanwhile, the high end liquor sector will continue to gain market share
from low end sector on consumers’ trading up.

Revising up earnings 12-42% in 2018-20
For 2018, we forecast 31% sales growth, which is largely in line with management
guidance, factoring 18% volume growth for mainstream products, 12% price
increase from product mix, and 33% sales growth from low end mass products.
Meanwhile, we expect Wuliangye’s net margin to expand in 2018, helped by
increasing portion of super premium products, lower channel subsidies and
operating leverage.
For 2019-20E, we are revising up our earnings forecast by 26%-42% to factor in

Revising up target price to Rmb98; reiterating buy
Based on new earnings forecast, we are revising up target price by 40% to Rmb98
base on DCF model, factoring in 9.5% WACC (3.9% RFR, 5.6% ERP, 1.0 beta,
debt-free structure) and a 2% terminal growth rate (in line with long term inﬂation
rate). We reiterate Buy on the stock. Our target price implies 27x P/E with 29%
earnings CAGR in 2018-20, we think this is reasonable given:
■
Our target P/E is slightly lower than 30x 2018 P/E for China liquor sector;
■
Wuliangye currently trades at 10% discount to Moutai's due to its weaker
branding (Figure 11). Our target 27x P/E is also 10% discount compared
to our 30x target P/E on Moutai.
We are changing valuation methodology from EV/EBITDA to DCF approach,
because 1) we believe DCF approach could incorporate Wuliangye’s long-term
growth, as we expect the company to maintain 20% earnings CAGR in 2017-20
helped by its investment in channels and brandings; 2) DCF approach could
also incorporate Wuliangye’s increasing cash ﬂow generating capabilities; with
increasing branding powers, Wuliangye’s working capital is improving as it
require increasing number of distributors to make advance payment before
delivery. Downside risk: channel de-stocking in high-end liquor sector; food
safety; worse than expected macro ﬁxed asset investment slow down.

or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Trade ideas
for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction belief by an
analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of no less than
two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients,
and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the
majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does
not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an
oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
