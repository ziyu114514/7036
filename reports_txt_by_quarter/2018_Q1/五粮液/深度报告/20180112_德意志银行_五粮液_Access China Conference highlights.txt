Access China Conference highlights
Still needs more time before next price hike
Investors' questions focus on whether Wuliangye will raise its ex-factory prices.
Management did not rule out the possibility of an increase in time, especially
after Moutai's price hike. However, it thinks that more time is needed, given that
channel proﬁt has only been stable for one year. The company's priority currently
is to maintain channel proﬁt margins and to strengthen the retail price stability.
Target 30% yoy sales growth in 2018
Management is conﬁdent it can reach its target. Key sales drivers will be: 1)
mainstream Wuliangye to grow by 18% from 17,000 tons in 2017 to 30,000 tons
in 2018; 2) price increase through raising the portion of "out of plan" volume from
10% in 2017 to 50% in 2018, implying a 5% price increase; and 3) incremental
sales of mass market sub brands to RMB10bn in 2018 – it targets to build up
one sub brand with RMB2bn sales, and 2-3 sub brands with RMB1bn sales by
the end of 2020.
To increase channel penetration through its "10 thousand project"
Management aims to increase its penetration through a “hundreds of cities,
thousands of counties, and ten thousand stores” program. By the end of 2017,
it had built up 7,000 core POS and 1,000 Wuliangye specialty stores. It targets
to increase to 8,000 core POS and 1,500 specialty stores in 2018. The channel
expansion will be a key driver for its 30% growth target. Meanwhile, through
installing IT systems at the retail end, the company will have stronger control in
channel inventory and better understanding of the market.
Our view: don't leave the party too early
We like Wuliangye for its lower risk in channel de-stocking, especially after
Moutai price increase and with the approach of Chinese New Year. We expect the
company to enter a secular growth period in 2018-19, and its earnings to register
29% CAGR in 2018-20E, driven by management’s strong incentives for growth
and expanding the high end liquor market after the increase in Moutai price. We
reiterate our Buy rating with TP of RMB98 based on DCF approach. Downside
risk: channel de-stocking in the high-end liquor sector; food safety; worse-than-
expected macro FAI slow down.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
