Access China conference highlights
4Q sales growth slowing down due to late Chinese New Year
Management expects sales growth in 4Q17 to slow down from 18% in 3Q17,
due to shorter peak season falling in 4Q17 with a later 2018 Chinese New Year
season. For the full year 2017, it expects sales growth to achieve double digit,
core margins (exclude government subsidy) to expand, and net proﬁt to achieve
positive growth. The sales growth has been mainly driven by increasing demand
and increasing market share in the lower tier region. The management indicates
that the industry sales grew by 7% in 2017, with 8-10% growth in lower tier region
and 5-6% in high tier regions.
Industry competition could ease down in 2018
Management expects the good demand growth to continue in the near-term. The
key sales driver will be UHT yoghurt and high end UHT milk. The competition
could ease down thanks to a more balanced raw milk supply. Yet there will be
increasing cost pressure due to rising raw material cost. Unless there is a sharp
increase in raw milk price, the management does not expect a like-for-like price
hike, but it will reduce price promotion to partly oﬀset the cost increase.
Soy milk contribution is still limited in early stage
Yili launched soy milk with the brand "plant selected" in January. It currently has
two SKUs for soy milk , the original taste priced at Rmb4.0/pack and the black soy
bean priced at Rmb4.6/pack. The company is positive on the sector and estimate
the industry market size to be Rmb100bn. In 2018, it expects soy milk sales should
be a few hundreds million, and think it is still too early to achieve break even due
to initial marketing spendings.
Our view: growth story intact
Yili's guidance is in line with our expectations. We expect its market share could
continue to increase in 2018 with industry competition slowing. Meanwhile, the
soy milk and new SKUs continues to be key sales drivers. As industry leader, we
believe Yili could pass through the cost inﬂation by reducing price promotion and
ultimately price hikes. We reiterate Buy on Yili. Downside risks: food safety, and
oversupply.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
