Midea doubles down on robotics as 
cooperation with KUKA strengthens 
Midea speeds up consolidation of KUKA. The KUKA Executive Board has 
decided to merge the China divisions of both its General Industry 
Business and its subsidiary Swisslog Holding AG–which specializes in 
integrated automation solutions for hospitals, warehouses and 
distribution centers–with Midea. KUKA and Midea will each hold a 50% 
stake in the JV. Meanwhile, a robot park will be built in Midea’s 
headquarters Shunde in the manufacturing heartland of Guangdong 
Province, eying a capacity of 75,000 robots (with a total capacity of 
100,000 robot units including existing capacities) by 2024. 
Midea better poised to ride the automation wave. As part of the 
Industry Internet drive, Midea’s deepened cooperation with KUKA will 
accelerate the world’s largest home appliance maker’s transformation 
into an industrial automation powerhouse. This follows a tie-up with 
YASKAWA in 2015 to gatecrash into the robotics field, its acquisition of 
KUKA in 2016 to extend to robotics hardware manufacturing and the 
purchase of Servotronix in 2017 to complement KUKA’s weakness in the 
robot control systems area. 
The latest move puts Midea in a better position to reap the benefits of 
the wave of automation sweeping across China, the world’s biggest 
market for industrial robots. 
Earnings forecast. We predict Midea to have EPS of RMB2.65/3.23/3.87 
for 2017-2019, corresponding to 21x/17x/14x PER. Maintain Buy. 
Risk factors: stiffening competition in the home appliance market; 
volatility in raw material prices and labor supply.
