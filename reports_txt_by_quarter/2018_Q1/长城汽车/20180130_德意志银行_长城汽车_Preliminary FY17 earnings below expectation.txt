Preliminary FY17 earnings below
expectation
4Q17 net proﬁt down 36% YoY on heavy SG&A burden
Great Wall Motor (GWM) released its preliminary FY17 results after market
close on 26 January. In brief, the company recorded a 2.6% YoY gross revenue
increase to RMB101.2bn, better than the 0.4% YoY sales volume decline, probably
due to mix improvement, in our view. Meanwhile, GWM’s FY17 reported net
proﬁt decreased 52.3% YoY to RMB5.0bn. The earnings are below our estimates
(RMB5.5bn) with lower net margins, and the company attributes the earnings
drop to 1) discounting, 2) higher marketing costs and 3) higher R&D.
On a quarterly basis, GWM registered a 7% YoY (70% QoQ) 4Q17 gross revenue
jump to RMB37.7bn, mainly driven by sales of the new WEY VV5m VV7, and the
new generation Haval H6, in our view. The company recorded a 36% YoY drop
in 4Q17 net proﬁt (up 369% QoQ), with the sequential earnings recovery helped
by less discounting, in our view.
Deutsche Bank view – margin recovery not a guarantee yet
While GWM staged a sequential earnings recovery in 4Q17 and the company cut
their discount level further according to our recent check, the pace of recovery is
still below our expectation, not to mention that GWM’s FY17 recurring proﬁt was
even lower at RMB4.3bn according to the announcement. What is more, since
both local brand and JV competitors have been posing a greater threat in various
SUV price segments, we remain concerned that the transaction price rebound
might not be sustainable even though GWM does not have an aggressive sales
target for this year. This is not to mention that ongoing cost inﬂation in various
aspects like R&D will likely cap the extent of earnings recovery in upcoming
quarters. We currently have Sell ratings on GWM's H shares and its A shares
with target valuation at 7x FY18E P/E. Key upside risks are stronger-than-expected
sales growth, rapid margin recovery and new JV formation.

and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market

Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
