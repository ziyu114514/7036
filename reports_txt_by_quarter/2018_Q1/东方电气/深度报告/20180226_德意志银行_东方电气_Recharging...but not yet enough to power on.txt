Recharging...but not yet enough to
power on
Earnings seem to have stabilized; upgrading H-share to Hold
Following a 40% underperformance (relative to HSCEI index) over the past one
year, we are upgrading Dongfang Electric-H to Hold from Sell, as we believe
the negatives have been largely priced in. Earnings started to stabilize as 2017
turned proﬁtable after a huge net loss in 2016. That said, the stabilization is not
a reﬂection of demand recovery in core operations but driven by better-than-
expected cost reduction. The scope for further cost cuts is limited. We also do not
see support yet for a Buy case for its H-share. Against revised ROE assumptions
of 3-4% for 2018-19E, we believe our target P/B of 0.6x on 2018E is fair.
Power equipment: it seems that the worst is not yet over
■
Coal-fired (c.50% of total GP): Based on our utility team's projections,
annual capacity additions will fall to 30-40GW over 2017-19 (vs. 40-70GW
over 2014-16) and drop signiﬁcantly to 11GW by 2020. Beyond 2020,
annual capacity additions will likely continue to fall to a sustained low
level of 5-10GW.
■
Wind power (c.10% of total GP): Annual capacity additions at the industry
level will likely stay at c.22GW over 2018-20E (vs. 19-21GW in 2016-17).
In addition to limited industry growth, Dongfang has been struggling in
terms of market position (its market share has halved since 2011) and
proﬁtability (only a single-digit GPM).
■
Nuclear power (c.10% of total GP): Approvals for new nuclear projects
clearly disappointed the market in 2017, against the high hopes. This
limits Dongfang's ability to convert its revenue in 2018 (under the
percentage-of-completion accounting method). We would prefer to stay
on the sidelines until we see concrete signs of a resumption in approvals.
Non-power equipment: not enough to drive a rerating
■
Overseas EPC: In light of the power equipment downturn and the
OBOR initiative, Dongfang clearly puts more emphasis on the overseas
EPC business. However, revenue conversion has failed to come through
despite a high backlog coverage of >5x. Given the uncertainties
associated with the execution of overseas projects, visibility of a
signiﬁcant take-oﬀ of the business in 2018 is low. Moreover, Chinese
constructors' subdued valuations (at an average P/B of 0.6-0.7x on 2018E)
do not seem to support a rerating case for Dongfang.

Power plant services: Management has been bullish on the segment's
growth outlook. However, even at the assumed 25-30% revenue growth
for 2018-19E, GP contribution would reach only 12% by 2019E.
Earnings stabilization hinges upon cost reduction
Asset impairment losses, a key swing factor in earnings since 2015, seem
to have narrowed and there are signs of stabilization ahead. According to
Dongfang's 2017 earnings preview, selling expenses (which mainly include
warranty expenses) and asset impairment losses dropped 40% yoy. In our view,
these were the key drivers of its earnings turnaround in 2017, in addition to
margin normalization in its wind power, hydro power and construction business.
However, given the ongoing thermal equipment downturn, we don't see much
scope for further improvement in cost.
Upgrading H-share to Hold; reiterating Sell on A-share
Incorporating the 2017 earnings preview and latest company guidance, we
raise our earnings forecasts for 2018/19E, driven mainly by cost assumptions
(impairment losses and warranty expenses in particular). We raise our target
prices to HKD7.0 for the H-share and to Rmb5.7 for the A-share. We upgrade
the H-share to Hold as we believe the current valuation (0.6x P/B on 2018E) is
fair relative to our revised ROE assumption of c.3% for 2018. We reiterate Sell on
the A-share, given a rich valuation (at 1.0x 2018E P/B). Key risks: 1) better/worse-
than-expected delays/cancellations in thermal power projects and faster/slower-
than-expected progress in nuclear power projects.

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Trade ideas
for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction belief by an
analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of no less than
two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients,
and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the
majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and does
not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an
oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
