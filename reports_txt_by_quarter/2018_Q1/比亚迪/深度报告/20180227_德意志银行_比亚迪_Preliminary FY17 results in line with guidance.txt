Preliminary FY17 results in line with
guidance
20% YoY decline in preliminary FY17 net proﬁt on 2% YoY revenue growth
On 26 February, BYD announced its unaudited preliminary FY17 results (in PRC
GAAP) after market close. In summary, the company recorded a 2.3% YoY
increase in gross revenue to RMB105.9bn but a 19.7% YoY drop in net proﬁt to
RMB4.1bn. The earnings are near the lower end of the company’s FY17E net proﬁt
guidance of RMB4.0-4.3bn in October 2017. In addition, the preliminary FY17 net
proﬁt translates to 4Q17 net proﬁt of RMB1.3bn (down 8.8% YoY), with lower
earnings YoY drop vs. 9M17 probably due to a year-end rise in new energy vehicle
(NEV) sales and sequential improvement in conventional car sales, partially oﬀset
by the negative impact of NEV subsidy cut, in our view.
According to the announcement, BYD attributes the FY17 earnings decline to the
decrease in traditional car sales and weak environment for the solar business,
partially oﬀset by strong handset metal casing demand growth. The company
also highlights that 1) its traditional car business has improved with the launch
of the Song MAX MPV and 2) it has booked revenue from the monorail business
starting 2H17.
Deutsche Bank view - limited surprise with outlook partly masked by subsidy
cut
BYD’s preliminary FY17 net proﬁt is in line with our FY16E earnings estimate
of RMB4.2bn. Going forward, while we expect its traditional car sales to further
improve on more model refreshes with the new design and its NEV sales to grow
fast, the latest round of government NEV subsidy cut will cap its earnings growth
prospect in FY18E. As such, we have a Hold rating. Our SOTP-derived target price
implies FY18E P/E of 31.6x, the highest target P/E benchmark among its local
peers, which we think is justiﬁed by its exposure to China's NEV market and its
26% FY17-19E two-year EPS CAGR.
Key downside risks: weak car sales, a slow margin recovery in the auto and battery
businesses, and more equity fund raising. Key upside risks: rapid auto sales and
margin improvement, and better sales and/or a margin recovery in the battery
business.

have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Trade ideas
for equities can be found at the SOLAR link at http://gm.db.com. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction belief by an
analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of no less than
two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss with our clients,
and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or events that may
have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report, which impact
may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market
conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at deﬁned
intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management, and the

Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
