Proﬁt alert on massive writedown;
recurring in-line with DBe
Recurring loss in-line but beat consensus
QSLI released preliminary FY17 results with net loss of RMB3.54-4.53bn vs. net
proﬁt of RMB341mn in FY16. The lower-than-expected results were attributed to:
1) assets impairment write-downs of RMB2.9-3.2bn from chemical integration
project, Haina PVC, Haihong ADC and magnesium integration projects; 2) a loss
in the chemical segment due to low utilization rate caused by two accidents which
resulted in higher production cost and lower production volume. If we exclude
impairments write-downs, recurring proﬁt should be net loss of c.1.37-2.13bn
(considering a 25% tax shield) in FY17, in-line with DBe of net loss of RMB2.1bn
on low end, but beat consensus estimates of net loss of RMB2.56 by 17%.
Mixed performance
■
Potash: according to our calculations, QSLI potash sales volume dropped
5% YoY in FY17 to 4.65mntons, indicating the 2H17 sales volume
rebounded back since the 1H17 registered 25% YoY sales volume decline.
■
Chemical: 1) high DD&A charge on magnesium integration and Haina
PVC projects starting operations; 2) lower overall utilization rate attributed
to a) two accidents in Haina and chemical subsidiaries; b) continuous
environmental scrutiny.
Earnings, valuation and risks; maintaining Hold
We maintain Hold rating with our DCF-derived TP at RMB11.66 (assuming a 6.6%
WACC and 2% terminal growth), which implies 1.2x P/B in 17-18E; we believe the
risks and rewards are balanced at a current valuation of 1.2x 17E P/B vs 1.1% 17E
ROE, supported by a potentially ROE-/EPS-accretive debt-to-equity swap plan.
Key downside risks: 1) sluggish chemical prices and soft demand could lead to
lower product sales; and 2) unfavorable government policy. Key upside risks: 1)
better-than-expected potash prices; and 2) faster-than-expected demand growth.

QSLI
Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
