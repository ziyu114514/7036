FY17 in line; asset quality and funding challenges persist 
 
 
 
 We resume coverage on Ping An Bank (PAB) with a Neutral rating and a TP of 
RMB11.80. We believe the improving retail banking franchise bodes well for PAB’s 
long-term profitability. However, we see limited upside from PAB’s current valuation 
given the funding cost and asset quality challenges. PAB’s FY17 net profit was in line 
with Wind consensus, with lower credit cost partly offsetting the NIM contraction. 
NPL formation rate improved, but remained at the high end among banks we cover.  
 Asset quality improved but pressure persists: PAB’s NPL ratio declined by 5bps 
QoQ to 1.70% at end-2017, thanks to the aggressive write-off. NPL formation rate 
declined slightly HoH in 2H17 to 2.46% under our estimation, but remained among 
the highest of banks we cover. Provision coverage ratio declined 1ppt QoQ to 151% 
at end-2017 and loan loss reserve was at 2.57% of total loans, down 9bps QoQ. 
NPLs was equivalent to 70% of >90-day overdue loans. With the less prudent NPL 
classification and high NPL formation rate, we believe provision pressure remains.  
 Lackluster NIM outlook: PAB reported NIM of 2.37% in 2017, compared with 
2.41% in 9M17. The NIM further contracted in 4Q17 due to higher interbank 
funding cost and lower loan yield with lower risk appetite, in our view. Given its 
weaker deposit franchise and continuous loan structure adjustment, we believe 
PAB’s NIM will remain under pressure amid tight liquidity. 
 Building up retail banking franchise: Retail banking made up 44% of total revenue 
in 2017, up from 31% in 2016. Credit card loans increased by 68% YoY in 2017, and 
total retail loans/deposits accounted for 50%/47% of total loans/deposits at end-
2017. Leveraging on Ping An Group’s franchise, we expect PAB’s retail franchise to 
improve further and support its profitability in the long term. 
 Valuation and risks: Our TP of RMB11.80 is the average of our 3-stage DDM model 
and Gordon Growth fair P/B model, based on profit growth of 11%/7%/3% in stage 
1/2/3 (terminal), dividend payout of 10%, sustainable ROE of 11.5%, and COE of 
10.0%. Our TP-implied 2018E P/B is 0.90x. Key risks: Upside: better-than-expected 
NIM and NPL. Downside: stricter-than-expected regulations on WMPs.

Asset Quality Pressure Persists 
PAB’s NPL ratio was down 4bps YoY and 5 bps QoQ in 4Q17, which may be driven by its 
aggressive write-offs, in our view. NPL write-offs and transfers amounted to RMB37bn 
in 2017, up 6% YoY, equivalent to around 144% of NPLs at end-2016. Overdue loan 
balance declined 13% HoH in 2H17 and special-mention loan balance also declined by 
5% HoH in 2H17, indicating improving asset quality.  
However, PAB’s NPL formation rate remained at 2.46% in 2H17 under our estimation, 
among the highest of banks we cover. We believe PAB still has to maintain relatively 
high write-offs for stable NPL ratios. Given the 151% NPL coverage ratio, close to the 
regulatory requirement of 150%, we believe the provision pressure remains high.

SML ratio declined in 2H17

NIM Contracted due to High Interbank Funding Cost 
PAB’s interbank liability made up around 30% of total liabilities (including NCD and 
borrowing from PBOC) at end-2017, up from 26% at end-2016. The surge in interbank 
market rates resulted in higher interbank funding cost and pressured PAB’s NIM. PAB’s 
deposits only increased by 4% YoY, compared with loan growth of 15% YoY in 2017. Also, 
given the asset quality deterioration pressure, PAB turned more cautious on risky loans 
in our view, and some new loan pricing is lower than that in the past few years. 
Although PAB increased its high-yield retail loans, the overall loan yield declined in 2H17, 
by our estimates.  
We expect PAB’s NIM to remain under pressure in the near term given the high 
interbank market rates, risk appetite adjustments and relatively weak deposit franchise.

Limited Capital Buffer 
PAB’s CET1 declined 4bps QoQ and 8bps YoY to 8.28% at end-2017, slightly higher than 
regulatory requirement of 7.5%. We expect higher capitalization pressure in 2018 for 
PAB, considering the higher risk weighting for interbank investment and credit shift 
from off-balance-sheet to balance-sheet assets. PAB announced its plan to issue 
RMB26bn convertible bonds (CB) in mid-2017. However, it may take some time to 
transfer the CB into core capital after the issuance, in our view.  
PAB adjusted its exposure to interbank investments and off-balance-sheet WMP in 
2H17. Interbank investments balance declined 26% HoH and off-balance-sheet WMP 
balance was down 15% HoH in 2H17.

Building up Retail Franchise  
The operating profit and revenue of PAB’s retail banks accounted for 67% and 44% of 
total, respectively, in 2017. The proportion of retail loans and deposits also increased in 
2017. In general, retail loan pricing is higher than corporate loans and the credit cost is 
less affected by economic cycles in China.  We believe better retail banking franchise 
may help PAB to improve its asset quality and NIM in the long term.  
The retail franchise may also support the bank’s fee income growth. PAB’s fee income 
increased by 10% YoY in 2017 despite the declines in WMPs and consulting fees, as its 
bank card fees increased by 49% YoY.
