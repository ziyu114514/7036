FY17 earnings tripled, beat
expectations
FY17 net proﬁt +c.200% YoY, beating expectations
WHC released prelim FY17 proﬁt guidance with net proﬁt growth of c.200% YoY.
This beat DBe/ consensus estimates by 26% / 11%. The strong results were driven
by: 1) a stronger PU performance in both ASP and volume; 2) higher non-recurring
proﬁt from government subsidies. Looking ahead, we expect strong 1Q18E on a
YoY basis with: 1) a robust MDI spread due to tight supply-demand dynamics and
high entry barriers; 2) strong performances from petrochemical and functional
materials. Therefore, we reiterate our Buy rating on the strong outlook ahead. The
biggest risks would relate to potential restructuring / M&A with parentco assets.
The stock is under suspension pending a restructuring announcement.
Strong PU / Functional material outlook
The robust MDI spread was driven by a domestic environmental scrutiny led
WHC polymeric MDI ASP rise of 92% yoy in 2017 to RMB26,717/ton. Looking
into 2018, we expect MDI average margin will continue to grow yoy due to a
low base in 1H17; conversely, we expect the global supply demand balance will
be ﬂat as the Sandra plant started operation in 3Q17 to oﬀset strong demand
growth globally. For the polycarbonate (PC) segment, where China relies heavily
on imports, the outlook remains strong; WHC's new PC plant phase 1 with 70ktpa
capacity started on January 23, making WHC the no#2 PC producer in China with
a total capacity of 200ktpa. We continue to expect functional material segment
(including PC) revenue to achieve a 39% CAGR in 2018-20E.
Valuation and risks
We base our RMB47.5 target price on 8.0x EV/EBITDA by using a Gordon
Growth Model, which is at a 15% discount to its historical average of 9.4x.
Before suspension, the stock was at 6.1x forward EV/EBITDA, representing a 35%
discount to the historical average. Key risks: 1) unexpected corporate actions,
including restructuring and M&A; 2) unplanned maintenance turnarounds; 3)
ﬂuctuations in oil and chemical product prices; and 3) lower-than-expected GDP
growth impacting demand growth.

may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as described
herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient thereof
if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in market

Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
