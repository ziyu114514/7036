Shengyi Tech’s 2Q22 revenue/NP to shareholders declined 13.5% YoY/47.9% 
YoY to RMB4,607mn/RMB453mn. 2Q results miss was due to 1) weak demand 
from consumer markets, 2) ASP pressure due to peers’ aggressive price war and 
3) significant energy cost increase. GPM decreased slightly to 23.2% in 2Q from 
23.6% in 1Q. Looking forward, we expect PCB to outperform CCL business, 
driven by capacity ramp up for auto market and easing margin pressure. We cut 
our forecasts for 2022/23E and slightly tweaked TP to RMB19.2. Maintain HOLD. 
 CCL business under pressure. CCL/prepreg sales declined 18.3%/4.4% 
YoY/QoQ in 2Q (vs. 4.0%/-4.8% in 1Q). GPM decreased to 22.7% in 1H22 
from 25.7%/29.3% in 2H21/1H21. 2Q may be the weakest quarter for CCL, 
due to deteriorating demand and price war. However, 2H22 could still be 
challenging as market demand is still on its way of slow recovery, especially 
for consumers. ASP should have reached the bottom given little room to cut 
price further.  
 PCB business to continue outperform. PCB sales grew 14.2%/9.1% 
YoY/QoQ in 2Q (vs. 7.2%/-12.2% in 1Q). GPM decreased to 21.2% in 1H22 
from 16.5%/18.8% in 2H21/1H21. The majority of PCB sales were from the 
telecom market, which remain stable. We believe the growth was mainly from 
the auto market. Auto PCB has experienced fast growth in 2021, with revenue 
contribution increasing from 1% to 8%, thanks to production ramp up. 
Prismark forecasts PCB market to grow 4.2% YoY in 2022, moderate growth 
after significant growth of 24.1% YoY in 2021. We think Shengyi will 
outperform peers, driven by strong demand from auto market, increasing 
capacity and easing margin pressure.  
 Maintain HOLD, TP adjusted to RMB19.2. We cut Shengyi’s FY22-23E 
revenue by 9%-10% considering CCL demand recovery could be slow. We 
derive our TP using the same 16.6x target P/E multiple,~ avg. 1-yr forward 
P/E. TP was adjusted to RMB19.2 on valuation rollover to 2023E P/E. 
Potential downside risks include: 1) worse-than-expected global economy that 
curbs consumer spending, 2) continuous ASP pressure and 3) increasing 
manufacturing costs, i.e. energy costs.
