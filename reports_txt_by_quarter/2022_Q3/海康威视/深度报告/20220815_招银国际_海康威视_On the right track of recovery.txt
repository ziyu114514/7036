Hikvision FY2Q22 results missed our/ consensus estimates on 1) COVID-19 
resurgence in China, 2) lower GPM and 3) higher R&D. Key highlights include 
strong innovative/ overseas businesses growth (+26% YoY/ +19% YoY 
respectively) despite macro headwinds. We expect gradual recovery in FY2H22E 
with PBG/ EBG orders pick-up. We revised down our target price to RMB45.08 
(prior RMB57.10) to reflect lower margin and higher R&D. Hikvision is trading at 
2-SD below three-year mean and we think the share price has already priced in 
the heightened geopolitical risk. Maintain BUY. 
 FY2Q22 weakness largely priced-in. Hikvision delivered a weak, yet largely 
anticipated, FY2Q22 results with revenue of RMB20.7bn (+4% YoY) and net 
profit of RMB3.5bn (-19% YoY). This is attributable to 1) COVID-19 
resurgence in China, 2) lower GPM (-3.3 pts YoY to 42.7%) given more low-
margin construction/ implementation work (GPM: 17.5% in FY1H22 vs. 29.0% 
in FY1H21) and 3) higher R&D of RMB2.6bn (+19% YoY, +26% QoQ).  
 Expect gradual recovery in FY2H22E with continuous business 
transformations. Traditional surveillance business grew +6.8% YoY to 
RMB30.3bn in FY1H22, largely driven by strong overseas sales of RMB9.7bn 
(+19% YoY). Business in China was affected by lockdowns in Mar-May 
although Jun sales recovered slightly, according to management. We are 
positive on continuous business transformations including 1) innovative 
business segment delivered steady growth of +26% YoY to RMB7bn in 
FY1H22 despite macro headwinds and 2) overseas business growth 
momentum reflects Hikvision hardly-replicable advantages (i.e. technology, 
supply chain, sales network etc.) in global market.  
 Preparing for heightened geopolitical risk with increasing R&D and high 
inventory strategy. Business recovery is still uneasy with rising geopolitical 
risk and COVID-19 uncertainties in China. Hikvision has maintained a high 
inventory strategy (+37% YoY) to minimize the impacts from supply chain 
disruption. Also, Hikvision R&D has reached a new level (RMB2.6bn in 
FY2Q22, +19% YoY). This will drive innovative business growth (smart home/ 
robotics/ thermal etc.) and hence better revenue mix in the long term.  
 Maintain BUY. We revised down FY22-24E net profit by 3-7% to reflect lower 
gross margin and higher R&D. Maintain BUY with new target price of 
RMB45.08 (prior RMB57.10). Key downside risk includes new U.S. sanction.

Valuation  
Hikvision (002415 CH, BUY, TP RMB45.08) 
We revised down our target price to RMB45.08 (prior RMB57.10), based on lowered 20x 
FY23E P/E, 1-SD below its 3-year mean. We think current valuation over-reacted to 
potential U.S. sanctions. Hikvision’s continuous R&D and business diversification should 
drive re-rating.
