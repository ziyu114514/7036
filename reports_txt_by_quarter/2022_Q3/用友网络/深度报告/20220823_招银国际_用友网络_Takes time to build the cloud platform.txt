Yonyou reported better than expected FY2Q22 with steady revenue growth of 
+15% YoY to RMB2.26bn. Cloud revenue grew +57% YoY to RMB1.55bn. 
However, we observed ARR/ contract liabilities growth have slowed to +2%/ +11% 
HoH. These may suggest a decline in renewal rate and add pressure to Yonyou’s 
cloud subscription business. Meanwhile, Yonyou increased R&D in cloud 
platform YonBIP targeting large-sized enterprises. R&D was up +38% YoY, as 
well as R&D capitalization rate. We think earnings quality will be distorted during 
the YonBIP ramp up phase. Maintain HOLD.  
 FY2Q22 beat on lower opex ratio. Yonyou delivered steady top-line growth 
at +15% YoY to RMB2,258mn, beating our/ consensus estimates by 9%/2%. 
Cloud revenue was RMB1,551mn (+57% YoY, +107% QoQ), accounting for 
69% of total. Operating profit was RMB89mn (+34% YoY), lower opex ratio at 
57.3% (-2.7 pcts) has offset decline in GPM (-2.1 pcts YoY to 61.2%). Net 
profit was RMB137mn (-40% YoY). 
 ARR/ contract liabilities HoH growth slowdown adds uncertainty to 
cloud outlook. In FY1H22, Yonyou cloud revenue grew +53% YoY to 
RMB2,299mn. In terms of customer mix, 67/ 18% of cloud revenue came from 
large-sized/ SME enterprises. ARR was RMB1,680mn (+102% YoY, +2% 
HoH). Cloud contract liabilities was RMB1,760mn (+42% YoY, +11% HoH). 
These cloud metrics look good on a YoY basis but HoH growth rates slowed. 
These may suggest a decline in renewal rate and we are concerned that 
Yonyou’s subscription revenue (mostly derived from SME) growth may slow 
down. 
 Increasing R&D (and capitalization rate) related to YonBIP platform for 
large-size enterprises. In FY1H22, Yonyou increased R&D expenditure by 
38% YoY to RMB1.32bn as the Company continues to develop cloud-native 
YonBIP platform for large-sized enterprises. R&D capitalization rate also rose 
to 26.4% (vs. 21.9% in FY1H21). We think earnings quality will be distorted in 
the short term during YonBIP ramp-up stage.  
 Maintain HOLD. We raised FY22-24E net profit by 1-5% to reflect better than 
expected opex control. Maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB19.81 
(prior RMB19.58), based on unchanged 5.0x FY23E EV/sales.

Valuation  
Yonyou (600588 CH, HOLD, TP RMB19.81) 
We maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB19.81 (prior RMB19.58), based on 
unchanged 5.0x FY23E EV/sales (40% discount to global enterprise SaaS person lower 
subscription revenue contribution). Yonyou is trading at three-year low but we believe re-
rating would be difficult in the short term given that 80% of its cloud revenue is derived from 
large-enterprises who are less willing to accept subscription model and require higher 
customization work.
