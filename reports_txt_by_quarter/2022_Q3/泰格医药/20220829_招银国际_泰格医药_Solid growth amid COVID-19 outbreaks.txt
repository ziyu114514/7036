Tigermed (300347 CH) 
 
 
 
Solid growth amid COVID-19 outbreaks 
 
1H22 earnings beat. Tigermed reported 1H22 revenue of RMB3,594mn, up 
75% YoY, attributable net income of RMB1,192mn, down 5% YoY, and 
attributable recurring net income of RMB771mn, up 42% YoY. 1H22 revenue 
accounted for 51% of our full-year forecasts, mainly attributable to the 
continuous revenue contribution from COVID-19 related multi-regional clinical 
trials (MRCTs) as well as solid growth from emerging business (including 
medical registration, scientific affairs, medical translation, real world studies, 
etc.) and data management, statistical analysis (DMSA) and other services. 
Excluding COVID-19 revenue, 1H22 revenue increased by c.45% YoY. Gross 
profit margin (GPM) deteriorated to 39.7% in 1H22 from 47.6% in 1H21 while 
remained largely stable versus the 40.9% GPM in 2H21. GPM was understated 
due to large proportion of pass-through revenue from COVID-19 projects. 
Considering the shrinking size of COVID-19 related revenue, we expect 
Tigermed’s GPM to recover in 2H22E. During 1H22, non-COVID-19 related new 
orders increased by c.37% YoY, indicating sustainable growth of core business. 
 Solid growth despite negative impact from COVID-19 outbreaks in 
1H22. Leveraging its nationwide clinical network, Tigermed was able to 
largely mitigate business disruptions caused by COVID-19 outbreak in 
China, especially in Shanghai and Jinlin. As a result, the Company delivered 
continuous growth in the number of ongoing clinical trials. As of Jun 2022, 
Tigermed operated 607 ongoing drug clinical trials (vs 567 as of Dec 2021), 
including 400 single-region clinical trials conducted in China (vs 385 as of 
Dec 2021) and 58 MRCTs (vs 50 as of Dec 2021). In addition, emerging 
businesses (including medical registration, scientific affairs, medical 
translation, real world studies, etc.) continued strong growth driven by solid 
demand, demonstrating Tigermed’s enhanced integrated capabilities.  
 Human resources allocation focusing on high-margin business and 
overseas expansion. Tigermed proactively reduced the team size of the 
low-margin site management organization (SMO) services to 2,503 staff as 
of Jun 2022 from 2,700+ as of Dec 2021. However, employee hirings for 
other business remained active, especially for its overseas business. 
Tigermed expanded its overseas team size to 1,151 staff as of Jun 2022 
from 1,026 as of Dec 2021. We expect the Company to further enhance its 
overseas service capabilities via M&As. 
 Maintain BUY. We slightly lift our TP from RMB173.39 to RMB175.15, based 
on a 10-year DCF model (WACC: 9.84%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%). We 
forecast revenue to grow 38%/31%/29% YoY and attributable adjusted net 
income to grow 39%/46%/32% YoY in FY22E/23E/24E.
