Innolight announced a positive profit alert. 1H22 NP to shareholders is expected 
to grow 32.03-55.51% YoY to RMB450mn-RMB530mn. 1H22 NP excluding 
extraordinary items is expected to grow 29.85-55.82% YoY. Mid-point NP of 
RMB490mn is estimated to account for 44.2% of FY22 NP, in line with our 
previous forecast. The mgmt. attributed the growth to surging data demand (for 
400G/200G optical modules) and continuous capital expansion from datacenter 
clients. We maintain BUY rating with unchanged TP of RMB45.60. 
 1H22 results in line with our previous forecasts. Mid-point 2Q NP to 
shareholders is expected to grow 31.2% YoY and 25.4% QoQ. The Company 
also mentioned GPM increased in 1H22, driven by favorable product mix 
(higher % of 400G/200G in terms of shipment), effective cost mgmt. and 
impact from FX changes. We think 2Q results are in line with our previous 
forecasts. This positive profit alert confirmed our view that optical transceiver 
industry is one of a few sectors that managed to maintain their steady growth.  
 Datacenter demand to remain resilient in 2H22 despite concerns over 
demand and spending cut. As earning season is coming, the market is 
looking for more clarity over demand/supply. We expect mobile and PC 
demand to remain weak, and the supply chain will continue to face challenges 
from inventory adjustment. However, we believe data center and auto markets 
will continue to outperform due to resilient demand. Although there are signs 
of capex cut, we maintain our positive outlook. We think cloud companies’ 
infrastructure capex will be one of the last to be affected, given these spending 
will support business to outperform during tough economy.  
 Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB45.60. Innolight is a major 
beneficiary of cloud capex growth. Product mix will continue to improve as 
clients will deploy 800G optical modules starting from year end or early 2023. 
Maintain BUY. TP of RMB45.60 is equivalent to 26x 23E P/E, close to 
historical 2-year average (25x).  
 Potential risks include weaker capex from global cloud companies, slower 
deployment of 5G infrastructure and faster-than-expected tech advancement.
