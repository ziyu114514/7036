Innolight announced its 2Q22 results. 2Q22 revenue/NP to shareholders grew 
17.3%/32.4% YoY and 2.6%/26.5% QoQ to RMB2.1bn/RMB275mn. GPM for 
2Q22 was 27.3% (vs. 23.8% for 2Q21 and 26.3% in 1Q22), mainly due to 
favorable product mix and reduced opex. We continue to see strong demand from 
overseas cloud clients, while domestic Datacom demand seems soft. We remain 
positive on overseas clients’ capex growth given their reaffirmed commitment to 
invest in technology infrastructure even in this tough macro environment. We 
maintain BUY rating and adjust TP to RMB42.0, reflecting softer-than-expected 
domestic demand for optical transceivers. 
 Innolight’s 2Q sales grew 2.6% QoQ, in line with expectations. By 
geography, overseas sales contribution increased significantly from 75.1% in 
FY21 to 85.6% in 1H22. This is mainly due to strong demand from overseas 
cloud companies and relatively soft demand from domestic ICPs. 
Amazon/Google/Meta’s total capex grew 34.9%/23.6% YoY in 1Q/2Q22. The 
surging demand for 200G/400G transceivers created favorable product mix. 
We see 2Q GPM grew to 27.3% vs. 26.3% in 1Q. As the market continues to 
embrace higher bandwidth (e.g., continuous migration to 200G/400G, deploy 
800G optical modules starts from 4Q22), we believe Innolight can benefit from 
this trend. 
 Looking forward, we remain positive on overseas clients’ capex growth. 
Although we see many companies are being disciplined or even cut on 
spending, large cloud leaders (AMAN/GOOG/FB/MSFT) all confirmed of 
continuous investments in technology infrastructure. However, the market 
seems to be less confident in Innolight’s clients’ demand, especially when 
Amazon and Meta guided lower-than-average sales growth for 3Q (-2% and -
6%) and reduced hiring plans, suggesting weak consumer spending. Contrary 
to the consensus, we are more opportunistic than the market, considering 
resources should be allocated to key growth drivers, which will help boost 
performance when macro recovers.  
 Maintain BUY and TP adjusted to RMB42.0. Innolight is a major beneficiary 
of cloud capex growth. We maintained positive outlook for its overseas 
business but lowered forecasts for domestic sales. New TP of RMB42.0 is 
based on 26x 23E P/E. Potential risks include 1) reduced capex from global 
cloud companies, 2) slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and 3) faster-
than-expected tech advancement.
