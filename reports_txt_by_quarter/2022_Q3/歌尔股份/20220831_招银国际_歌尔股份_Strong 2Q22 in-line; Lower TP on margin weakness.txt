Goertek (002241 CH) 
 
 
 
Strong 2Q22 in-line; Lower TP on margin weakness  in -line;   
 
Goertek’s 2Q22 revenue/ NP growth of 45%/54% YoY is largely in-line with its 
preliminary results, and 2Q GPM is slightly lower at 12.3% (-2ppt YoY, -1.4ppt 
QoQ) due to product mix and new product ramp. Also, Goertek reported soft 
3Q22 prelim earnings of 9.5%-40.7% YoY growth, which is below expectations 
due to weaker VR demand and macro weakness. Looking into 2H22E, we 
believe Goertek’s growth momentum will continue with multiple product launches 
from new-gen AirPods, Quest 2 Pro and PS VR2. Overall, we expect Goertek to 
remain the major beneficiary of AR/VR product cycle in 2023E, and deliver 
28%/23% YoY earnings growth in FY22/23E, backed by 62%/26% YoY in smart 
product segment (VR, gaming console, smart watch). Maintain BUY with new  
TP to RMB44.69, based on same 28x FY22E P/E (7-yr hist avg). 
 Strong 2Q22 on solid VR/gaming console despite margin pressure. 
Goertek reported solid 2Q22 results with revenue/recurring NP growth of 
45%/54% YoY, in-line with its preview earlier. Given Android demand 
weakness, 2Q22 precision components/hearables products declined 
11%/8% YoY, offsetting strong smart product (Watch, AR/VR, gaming 
console) of 119% YoY. In addition, 2Q GPM came in at 12.3% (-2ppt YoY, -
1.4ppt QoQ) due to weaker product mix and new product ramp up. For 
3Q22E, company pre-announced net profit of RMB1.75-2.25bn, up 9.5-
40.7% YoY, below expectations due to macro weakness and soft VR 
demand.  
 2023 Outlook: AR/VR and gaming console as dual growth engines. We 
believe Goertek’s VR/AR and gaming segment will continue to be major 
growth drivers (51%/55% of FY22/23E sales), which will grow at 62%/26% 
YoY in FY22/23E, backed by new product cycle from Oculus Quest 2 Pro and 
Sony PS VR 2 in 2H22E, as well as share gain in Sony PS 5. In addition, 
mgmt. maintained positive view with AR/VR/MR shipment target of 50-60mn 
unit in 2025, backed by a new wave of product launches from Meta, Pico and 
Apple in next two years. 
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB44.69. We trimmed our FY22-24E EPS 
by 3-7% to reflect lower margin and near-term macro weakness. Our new TP 
of RMB44.69 is based on same 28x FY22E P/E, based on 7-year hist. avg 
P/E. We believe recent pullback provides good buying opportunities (16.5x 
FY23E P/E), given its solid product roadmap and growth opportunities in 
AR/VR and gaming console biz.
