Sanya’s Omicron subvariant BA.5.1.2 outbreak has led to ~700 positive cases as 
of yesterday, and has prompted the city to initiate lockdown again subsequent to 
the one in April this year. In response to this, CTGDF has suspended its Sanya 
operation (Sanya DFS Mall phase 1 and 2) starting from 5 Aug (same day as the 
lockdown was initiated) until further notice. Judging from past experience, we 
estimate that Sanya’s social distancing policies will last for a month or so. This 
would undoubtedly put a pause on the recovery that we have seen in June and 
July, when August is at the core of the summer travel season. The incident has 
prompted us to lower our 2022E revenue by 14.9% considering also the 
preliminary results announcement for 2Q. Meanwhile, we raise our 2022E GPM 
by 1.4pp to factor in an improved discount discipline of the Hainan’s duty free 
business, and these in aggregate explain to an 8.1% cut in our 2022E net profits 
and put us 6.6% below consensus. That said, similar to many other outbreaks in 
the past, any disruptions from lockdowns to tourist traffic would only represent 
temporary drags to share price, in our view. If the situation gets under control 
within August, we still see scope for travel demand to recover sequentially into 
4Q, particularly when the quarter is seasonally clustered with festivals and 
shopping campaigns. We remain BUY-rated.  
 
An update on Hainan’s current outbreak. 827 confirmed positive cases 
were reported during 1-7 Aug in the province, with 689 cases being reported 
in Sanya. Local government has initiated a lockdown and implemented city-
wide nucleic acid tests. Meanwhile, inbound/ outbound flights, and public 
transportations are suspended. Tourists are permitted to return home only if 
they are tested negative after completing the 7-day risk screening tests (i.e., 
negative nucleic acid test results on day 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7). 
 
Solid July momentum. The Department of Commerce of Hainan Province 
reported over RMB5bn (+21% YoY) sales for offshore duty-free operators 
with RMB4bn duty-free sales (+9% YoY). The number extended from the 
strength in June in which CTGDF reported a 13% YoY sales growth. 
 
Valuation. Our new TP is based on an updated 45.0x (from 46.5x) roll-
forward mid-23E P/E (from end-22E) which still represents 2-year average 
since 2020. We raised our target multiple in our last upgrade report to reflect 
the potential re-rating driven by the sequentially recovering, though bumpy, 
domestic tourist traffic over 2H22.
