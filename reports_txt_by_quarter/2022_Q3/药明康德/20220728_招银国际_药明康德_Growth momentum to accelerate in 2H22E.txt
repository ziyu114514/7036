WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
Growth momentum to accelerate in 2H22E 
 
Strong 1H22 results. WuXi AppTec reported 1H22 revenue of RMB17.8bn, up 
69% YoY (71%/66% YoY for 1Q/2Q22), attributable recurring net income of 
RMB3.8bn, up 81% YoY (106%/65% YoY for 1Q/2Q22), and attributable adjusted 
Non-IFRS net income of RMB4.3bn, up 76% YoY (118%/49% YoY for 1Q/2Q22). 
Earnings are in line with our forecasts with 1H22 revenue / adjusted Non-IFRS net 
income accounting for 46%/51%, respectively, of our 2022 full-year estimates. 
Revenue growth in 1H22 would have further accelerated by 7.2 ppts to 76% YoY 
and adjusted Non-IFRS GPM would have improved by 1.9 ppts YoY to 38.1% 
under constant currency exchange rates. The management increased its revenue 
growth guidance to 68-72% YoY from 65-70% YoY for 2022E, supported by its 
solid RMB35bn backlog (+76% YoY) in 1H22. 
 WuXi Chemistry delivered phenomenal growth despite COVID-19 
interruptions, driven by strong growth from both COVID and non-COVID 
projects. WuXi Chemistry revenue jumped by 102% YoY in 1H22, mainly 
driven by the 145% YoY revenue growth of chemical CDMO services. Based 
on our estimates, the Company booked ~RMB4.2bn revenue from commercial-
stage COVID-19 projects in 1H22, accounting for ~32% of WuXi Chemistry 
revenue. Excluding the commercial-stage COVID-19 projects, the segment 
revenue still achieved robust growth of 37% YoY in 1H22, indicating a 
sustainable demand from non-COVID-19 projects. Driven by the successful 
one-stop CRDMO business model, we forecast revenue of WuXi Chemistry to 
increase 104%/11%/30% YoY in 2022E/23E/24E, representing a 43% CAGR 
in FY21-24E. 
 Cell and gene therapies (CGT) CDMO segment turned positive growth. 
CGT CDMO service revenue rebounded strongly to 36% YoY growth in 1H22 
from a 3% YoY decline in 2021, thanks to the steady increase in the number 
of CGT pipeline projects, from 57 as of end-2021 to 67 as of 1H22. The 
Company’s revolutionary AAV manufacturing technology, TESSA, has gained 
large interests from global clients. Six large biotech/pharma companies are 
testing TESSA technology and one large pharma client has already initiated 
TESSA technology licensure in 1H22. Given the significant yield improvement 
(30-40x) and cost saving (10-40x) compared with conventional production 
method (i.e., plasmid transfection), we think TESSA has the potential to 
become a game-changer in global CGT CDMO market. 
 Expedited globalization pace. Besides the ongoing constructions of large-
scale drug product manufacturing facilities in Delaware, US, WuXi AppTec 
announced to further invest US$1.4bn in next 10 years to build full-suite R&D 
and manufacturing capabilities in Singapore. Singapore sites will commence 
operations by 2025/26 which will enable the Company to better facilitate the 
growing and diversified client demand. 
 Maintain BUY. We maintained our TP at RMB185.17, based on a 10-year DCF 
model (WACC: 10.94%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%).
