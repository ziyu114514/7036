 
Sanya’s lockdown weighed on CTGDF’s 3Q results as we expected, 
with recurring net profits standing at RMB656mn, down ~45%, as we 
exclude non-core Beijing airport rental concession and Hainan tax cut impact. 
Despite this, revenue of the quarter rose 8% QoQ to RMB11.7bn, when 
online sales with Sunrise Shanghai made up most of the offline hiccups. The 
change in sales mix also led to an almost 10pp/11pp QoQ decline in GPM/ 
OPM to 24.7%/ 12.5%, respectively.  
 
Key takeaways from management calls.  
1) Forex impact: management has taken a few initiatives to mitigate the 
adverse impact from a strengthening USD (against RMB). This includes 
enriching forex reserves, extending payments (dominated in foreign 
currencies), and cost sharing with suppliers.  
2) Synergy with Swire Property: A piece of land was jointly acquired for the 
expansion of Haitang Bay Phase 1, and both CTGDF and Swire will work 
out the expansion of Haitang Bay Phase 2&3 together.  
3) The opening of the Haikou DFS mall on 28 Oct: with a total of 280k sq m, 
the mall covers 800+ global luxury brands and 25 of them, including YSL, 
Prada, Burberry, BV, Moncler, etc., had their first footstep in Hainan. On the 
other hand, according to our survey, customer could enjoy 20% for every 2 
cosmetic items purchased. For other popular brands like Shisedo, La Mer, 
Dior, discount ranges from 28-32% off MSRP.  
 
Earnings change. To reflect the 3Q results, we cut our 2022/23E revenue 
by 16.6%/ 23.8%, GPM by 1.6/0.9pp, leading to an average 23% cut in net 
profits for the periods. Our current forecast implies 4Q22E revenue/ net 
profits to be RMB17.7bn/2.2bn, with a 37% GPM, barring any unexpected 
lockdown for the quarter. For now, we assume Hainan will generate 
RMB54bn/75bn sales from duty-free operators (DF plus non-DF) in 2022/23 
and CTGDF will share ~80%/~77% of it.  
 
Valuation. Our revised TP is based on an unchanged 45.0x roll-forward 
end-23E P/E which still represents 2-year average since 2020.
