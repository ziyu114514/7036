Hengli’s reported net profit in 3Q22 grew 20% YoY, driven by FX gain due to the 
strong dollar. We estimate the core profit (excluding the finance income arising 
from FX gain) dropped ~9% YoY in 3Q22. While the 4% YoY revenue growth (vs 
-25% YoY in 1H22) is an early sign of recovery, it’s still slightly below our 
expectation. We revise down our 2022E/23E earnings forecast by 9%/8% to 
reflect more conservative assumptions on sales volume. We trim our TP to 
RMB58 accordingly, based on unchanged 30x 2022E P/E (equivalent to 3-year 
historical average). Maintain HOLD. We believe we are close to the inflection 
point but are waiting for more data points to confirm the recovery of excavator 
sales.        
 3Q22 earnings highlights. Revenue grew 4% YoY to RMB2bn, which we 
estimate was driven by the strong sales to the major US customer. Gross 
margin narrowed 2.1ppt YoY but expanded 1.7ppt QoQ. EBIT slightly dropped 
1.6% YoY to RMB576mn. It’s worth noting that Hengli recognized net finance 
income of RMB170mn (vs RMB6mn in 3Q21), thanks to the appreciation of 
dollar-denominated assets. This boosted the reported net profit by 20% YoY 
to RMB692mn. Operating cash inflow dropped 59% YoY to RMB377mn in 
3Q22. In 9M22, the reported net profit dropped 11% YoY to RMB1.75bnn.   
 Production plan in Oct 2022: Hengli has scheduled production volume of 
56k units of hydraulic cylinder (excavator), down ~15% YoY. Scheduled 
production volume of small /medium-large size pump drops >50% YoY, as a 
result of the continuous inventory clearance that affected the output. Planned 
volume of motor (mainly for AWP) drops 15% YoY. On the positive side, the 
planned production for non-standardized cylinders in Oct grows 7% YoY to 
16k units.  
 Early signs of recovery for the excavator industry. For the industry as a 
whole, we have started to see some early positive signs: (1) strong export will 
likely exceed expectation on the back of overseas mining activities; (2) 
upcoming sales data points in China will potentially beat expectations on the 
back of the very low base and continuous policy easing; (3) major cost items 
such as steel plate and freight rate are on the down trend, offering upside 
potential on the margin side.  
 Upside risk: (1) Strong recovery of excavator demand in China. Downside 
risks: (1) weak construction activities; (2) risk of overseas demand.
