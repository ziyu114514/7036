Youyou reported in-line revenue growth of +17% YoY to RMB2.06bn in FY3Q22. 
However, net loss widened unexpectedly to RMB284mn mainly due to margin 
erosion. Yonyou delivered slowest cloud revenue growth of +22% YoY since the 
company adopted cloud-focus strategy in 2019. Meanwhile, license-based 
software business from large-sized enterprises was up +19% YoY. This could 
imply large-sized enterprises are less willing to adopt cloud model and increasing 
customization may drag Yonyou’s margin further. Maintain HOLD.  
 FY3Q22 miss on margin. Yonyou delivered in-line revenue growth of +17% 
YoY to RMB2,059mn. Net loss widened to RMB284mn (vs. -RMB88mn in 
3Q21) mainly dragged by 1) GPM erosion (-8.2 ppts YoY to 49.9%) and 2) 
higher opex (+22% YoY to RMB1,394mn). Company attributed the bottom-
line miss to the strategic expansion in sales/R&D workforce given increasing 
software localization demand. Yonyou has 25,276 staff (+23% YoY) in 3Q22. 
However, we observed that revenue generated per employee has declined for 
6 consecutive quarters.  
 Revenue mix change suggest uncertainty in cloud migration strategy. 
Yonyou delivered the slowest cloud revenue growth of +22% YoY to 
RMB1,247mn in 3Q22 (vs. +57% YoY in 2Q22) since the company launched 
cloud-focus strategy in 2019. Meanwhile, revenue from Software recorded 
unexpected YoY growth of +15% YoY to RMB795mn (was in declining trend 
since 2019) as revenue from large-sized enterprise was up +19% YoY. Cloud 
revenue contribution thus dropped to 61% in 3Q22 (vs. 69% in 2Q22). This 
could imply large-sized enterprises are unwilling to adopt cloud model.  
 Software localization demand from SOEs benefits top-line but not 
margin. In FY3Q22, Yonyou recorded -8.2 ppts YoY in GPM. We believe 
Xinchuang demand from large-sized enterprises (mostly SOEs) will benefit 
Yonyou’s top line growth. However, as these SOEs have higher requirement 
in software customization, a continue change in revenue mix will likely drag 
Yonyou’s margin further. According to management, 95% of the sizable orders 
came from SOEs in 3Q22. 
 Maintain HOLD. We cut FY22/23E net profit by 22/13% mainly to reflect a 
lower margin. Maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB23.51 (prior 
RMB19.81), based on higher 6.0x (prior 5.0x) FY23E EV/sales. We raised our 
target multiple considering the software localization trend and hence demand 
for Yonyou’s ERP is solidified after the 20th Party Congress.

Valuation  
Yonyou (600588 CH, HOLD, TP RMB23.51) 
We maintain HOLD with new target price of RMB23.51 (prior RMB19.81), based on higher 
6.0x (prior 5.0x) FY23E EV/sales. We raised our target multiple considering the software 
localization trend and hence demand for Yonyou’s ERP is solidified after the 20th Party 
Congress.
