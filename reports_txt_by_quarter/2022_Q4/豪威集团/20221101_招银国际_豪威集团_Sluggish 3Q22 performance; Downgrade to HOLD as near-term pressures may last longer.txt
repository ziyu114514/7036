Willsemi announced its 3Q22 results. 3Q revenue declined 26.5% YoY and 22.1% 
QoQ to RMB4.3bn. NP to shareholders recorded a net loss of RMB120mn, a hard 
hit from smartphone market weakness and slow digestion of CIS inventory. GPM 
dropped to 28.4% in 3Q (vs. 33.3%/34.5% in 2Q22 and 2021). Although we had 
expected a weak 3Q performance and revised down our forecast pre-earnings 
announcement (link), 3Q results came in much lower than our estimates. We 
think the near-term weakness may last longer. We downgrade Willsemi to 
HOLD and cut TP to RMB78.18. 
 3Q22 results were lower than estimates and NP to shareholder recorded 
a net loss.  Although weak 3Q results had been widely expected, the numbers 
were much lower than estimates. Sales declined 22.1% QoQ in 3Q, which 
was usually the best quarter of a year. The decline was due to disappointing 
Android smartphone shipment, which resulted in slow destocking of handset 
CIS. Meanwhile, ASP was also falling given the intense competition.   
 Inventory increased another quarter by 11.6% QoQ and 96.6% YoY to 
RMB1.4bn in 3Q, which equaled to almost ~10 months of sales at current run 
rate (vs. 4.6x/5.7x/6.9x during 4Q21-2Q22). While the company guided that 
de-stocking process is improving, we expect it might take longer (normal 
level 4x monthly sales) than market currently expects, any de-stocking 
pace stagnation would cause downward pressure on stock. In addition, 
high level of inventory may increase the possibility of a potential write-off in 
near future. 
 Downgrade to HOLD and lower TP to RMB78.18. We lower bottom line 
forecasts for 2022/23E by 29% and 27%. We downgrade Willsemi to HOLD, 
as we expect the near-term pressures (demand weakness, ASP pressure, 
market sentiment, etc.) may take longer than expected to improve. The 
new TP is based on 29.3x 2023E P/E (vs. prev. 32x), ~1.0 PEG and close to 
domestic peers avg. (28.9x). Potential upsides include: 1) faster-than-
expected CIS de-stocking; 2) Android smartphone shipment recovery.
