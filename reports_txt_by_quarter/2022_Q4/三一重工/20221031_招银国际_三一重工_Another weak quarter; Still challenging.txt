SANY’s 3Q22 net profit declined 61% YoY to RMB963mn, with earnings largely 
contributed by finance income and other gains. The lack of gross margin recovery 
along with the increased distribution expense and R&D spending are the key 
factors that dragged the earnings. We slash our 2022E/23E/24E earnings 
forecast by 52%/38%/36% (37%-44% below consensus), largely a result of lower 
sales volume and higher expense assumptions. We cut our TP to RMB14.7, 
based on 28x 2022E PE (average since the upcycle starting from 2017 + 1SD). 
Our above average target multiple is to reflect potential earnings recovery in 
2023E driven by low earnings base and oversea market. Maintain HOLD due to 
the lack of upside potential. 
 Key highlights in 3Q22 results. Revenue dropped 8% YoY to RMB19bn. 
Gross margin slightly improved 0.6ppt QoQ but still dropped 1.1ppt YoY to 
23.8%. Selling & distribution expense ratio increased 2.9ppt YoY to 8.4%, 
while R&D expense ratio also increased 2ppt YoY to 8.4%. All these drove the 
EBIT down 91% YoY to only RMB158mn. Net profit declined 61% YoY to 
RMB963mn, with profit largely contributed by the finance income and other 
gains. Operating cash inflow increased 12% YoY to RMB500mn. In 9M22, 
revenue / net profit dropped 33%/71% YoY to RMB3.6bn.  
 Overseas accounted for 46% of total revenue in 3Q22. We calculate that 
the overseas revenue in 3Q22 surged 68% YoY to ~RMB9.3bn, driven largely 
by excavators (+89% YoY, 49% of total overseas revenue). In 9M22, overseas 
revenue grew 44% YoY to RMB25.9bn. We believe overseas market will 
continue to serve as a key growth engine that offsets the weakness in China.     
 Bear case scenario: 1.5x P/B. We still value SANY with earnings multiple at 
present. That said, we think market will potentially switch to asset-based 
valuation if the downcycle continues. We see 1.5x forward P/B (equivalent to 
RMB11.4, 21% downside) a key supporting level in the previous trough cycle 
(2014-17).  
 Upside risk: (1) stabilization of property investment; Downside risks: (1) 
further weakness in construction activities; (2) slowdown of overseas demand.
