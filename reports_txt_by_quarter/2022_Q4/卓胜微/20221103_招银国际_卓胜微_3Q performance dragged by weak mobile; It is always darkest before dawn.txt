Maxscend announced its 3Q22 results. 3Q revenue declined 30.5% YoY and 
13.6% QoQ to RMB782mn. NP to shareholders fell 54.6% YoY and 20.5% QoQ 
to RMB233mn. The decline was mainly attributable to the weak mobile market. 
3Q GPM increased slightly to 54.1% (vs. 52.4%/52.7% for 1Q/2Q22). We lowered 
our forecasts for 2022/23E sales by 25%/30%, due to both tough macro 
environment and prolonged weakness observed in mobile, particularly in Android 
names. However, considering a series of solid progress achieved from internal 
R&D (e.g., SAW filter, Diplexer, DiFEM, etc.), we expect the Company will 
continue to roll out products in new categories that are dominated by overseas 
names. We maintain a positive outlook for Maxscend, given its leading position 
in domestic RFFE market and proven track record of its management team. 
Maintain BUY, with revised TP of RMB107.8 reflecting reducing 22/23E sales.  
 Industry headwind may provide an opportunity for Maxscend. Despite 
mobile weakness, Maxscend’s 3Q results were resilient. The Company 
reported GPM of 54.1% (up 1.3% from 2Q), showing its relatively strong 
position in a broad weak market. GPM is estimated to drop 2% in 2023 due to 
increasing yield of new products, but will remain stable at ~50%, much higher 
than its peers (figure 3). The high GPM will help Maxscend to maintain its 
leading position in domestic RFFE market by continuously investing in R&D 
(3Q R&D exp. grew 55.1% YoY). Meanwhile, some smaller peers are 
struggling to survive. We believe Maxscend will be a beneficiary of a potential 
sector consolidation, following the same path of its global peers (e.g., 
Skyworks and Qorvo).  
 Maxscend’s product portfolio expansion is on schedule. Maxscend’s new 
fab line has entered mass production. The Company’s own filter products 
have been shipped. Meanwhile, diplexer and multiplexers are under client 
testing. We expect the Company to deliver more progress on high-end filter 
and integrated modules next year. Although the recent U.S. export curb has 
no impact on RFFE sector, China’s semi localization trend is certain. This will 
create more opportunities for domestic players.  
 Maintain BUY with TP revised up to RMB107.8. The new TP is based on 
36x rollover 23E P/E, lower than 1SD below 2-yr hist. avg. of 43.6x forward 
P/E. We kept the valuation of 36x P/E unchanged as we believe 1) semi 
localization trend is certain and 2) Maxscend is venturing into some key RFFE 
component areas which are dominated by overseas suppliers (domestic 
presence in certain components/modules are nearly zero).  
 Potential risks include 1) disappointing demand in mobile, 2) intensified 
competition, 3) slower-than-expected R&D and 4) further deterioration in 
macro environment. Potential upside includes M&A opportunities.
