As a leading online financial service provider in China, East Money Information 
continued to gain market shares from traditional financial institutions and 
delivered strong revenue and profit growth amid gloomy market environment, 
outperforming the industry. Upon the completion of conversion of RMB 16bn 
convertible bonds in 1H22, the company inserted the capital to its brokerage 
subsidiary, Eastmoney Securities Co. Ltd, strengthening its capital position and 
capabilities in delivering business growth in margin trading and security lending 
segments. With a strengthened capital base, we look positive on potentials of 
Eastmoney Securities Co. Ltd in support of robust growth among intense 
competitions. On fund distribution front, we expect the company to outperform 
peers and sustain market-leading position, given its lower customer acquisitions 
resulting from early entry and online ecosystem scalability. 
 Strong growth in brokerage business. East Money Information’s 
brokerage business delivered revenue growth of 23% YoY in 1H22, beating 
the industry average of 11% YoY decline, thanks to a continual market share 
expansion. The robust income growth was driven by 24% growth of fee & 
commission income and 19% YoY increase of net interest income. Looking 
forward, we expect that the company’s newly launched investment advisory 
business and fund custody business will engender more synergies with 
existing brokerage lines, further enhancing value generation from wealth 
management segment.  
 Strengthened capital base in support of robust business growth. In 
1H22, East Money Information injected RMB 16bn capital to its brokerage 
subsidiary, Eastmoney Securities Co Ltd., upon completion of conversion 
and delisting of its issued convertible bonds, which boosted the broker’s 
capital base by 50%. We expect this enhanced capital position to support 
robust growth of the company’s brokerage arm in forthcoming years. 
 Expanding market shares in third-party fund distribution segment. East 
Money recorded year-over-year growth in both fund sales volume and fund 
distribution AUM in 1H22, outpacing the industry average. Ranked as the 3rd 
largest distributors in non-money market and equity funds, East Money is well 
positioned to weather from market volatilities with its low customer acquisition 
costs driven by an extensive online ecosystem and economies of scale.
