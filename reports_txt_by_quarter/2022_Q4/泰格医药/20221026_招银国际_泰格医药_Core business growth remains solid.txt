Tigermed (300347 CH) 
 
 
 
Core business growth remains solid 
 
3Q22 earnings in line. Tigermed reported 3Q22 revenue of RMB1,812mn, up 
35% YoY, attributable net income of RMB413mn, down 22% YoY, and 
attributable recurring net income of RMB421mn, up 29% YoY. Excluding COVID-
19 revenue, we estimate 3Q22 revenue increased by c.42% YoY. The declining 
attributable net income in 3Q22 was mainly attributable to the fair value losses of 
RMB11mn, compared with fair value gains of RMB211mn in 3Q21. Gross profit 
margin (GPM) continuously improved to 40.9% in 3Q22 from 38.8% in 1Q22 and 
40.6% in 2Q22, thanks to the shrinking size of the low-margin COVID-19 related 
revenue (due to pass-through revenue to sub-contractors in overseas markets) 
as well as the growth of US$-denominated services, such as data management 
and statistical analysis (DMSA) and laboratory services provided by Frontage, 
which benefited from US$ appreciation in 3Q22. Non-COVID-19 related new 
orders increased by c.35%/30% YoY in 9M22/3Q22, respectively, indicating 
sustainable growth of core business. 
 Consistently focus on high-margin business. Management has prioritized 
the expansion of high-margin businesses, including clinical trials operation, 
DMSA and some emerging services while takes a relatively conservative 
strategy on the SMO business given its low profitability nature. According to 
management, the Company has further increased its market share in China 
clinical CRO market for innovative drugs to c.20% in 3Q22, which 
represented the Company’s strong competency and high customer 
recognition. DMSA successfully sealed a strategic cooperation deal with a 
global Top10 pharma in the past quarter. Additionally, Tigermed has adopted 
a proactive hiring strategy and allocated more human resources to high 
margin business in 3Q22. We think the strategic change is critical and 
necessary for Tigermed to further enhance its leading position for its core 
business given the intensifying competition in China market in recent years. 
 Globalization on track. Tigermed has built local BD teams to explore 
business opportunities in Europe and the US.  The Company has participated 
in large-scale Phase III multi-regional clinical trials (MRCT) in multiple middle 
and western European countries. The Company also took full advantages of 
its experiences in COVID-19 vaccine projects of Chinese clients to expand 
business opportunities in developing countries, including Indonesia, Brazil, 
Chile and Pakistan. These developing countries could be potential markets 
for Chinese drug makers, which will create additional demand for Tigermed’s 
clinical CRO services.  
 Maintain BUY. We revise our TP from RMB175.15 to RMB147.43, based on 
a 10-year DCF model (WACC: 10.21%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%). We 
forecast Tigermed’s revenue to grow 37%/29%/27% YoY and attributable 
recurring net income to grow 37%/40%/31% YoY in FY22E/23E/24E.
