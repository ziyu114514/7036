Yonyou (600588 CH) 
 
 
 
Distressed margin with non-standardized cloud  
 
Yonyou announced preliminary FY22 net profit of RMB200-220mn (-68.9-71.7% 
YoY). The weakness was attributable to COVID resurgence and FY4Q22 and higher 
R&D spending. While Yonyou’s business is slowly recovering in FY23E, we remain 
cautious on its cloud migration progress as its large enterprise customers (68% of 
revenue) are less willing to adopt standardized cloud model. Customization would 
result in higher R&D and thus limiting business scalability and margin upside from 
cloud migration.  
 Yonyou preliminary FY22 missed on COVID-resurgence and higher R&D 
expenses. Yonyou announced FY22 preliminary net profit ranged from 
RMB200-220mn (down 68.9-71.7% YoY), missed consensus estimate of 
RMB505mn. The was attributable to 1) COVID resurgence in FY4Q22 and 4Q 
usually accounts for 45% of full-year revenue 2) higher R&D and 3) FY21 
recorded one-off disposal gain of RMB214mn. FY22 core revenue (software + 
cloud) delivered YoY increase but the growth rate was lower than that in FY21 
(+16% YoY). We think the FY4Q22 top-line weakness is largely anticipated but 
the R&D surge is not.  
 Business slowly recovering in Jan, Yonyou’s subsidiary Chanjet targets 
30% YoY top-line growth in FY23E. Yonyou’s HK-listed subsidiary Chanjet 
(1588 HK) also announced FY22 profit warning. Yonyou’s business targeting 
small/ micro enterprises is operated through Chanjet (Yonyou owns 61.85% 
stake). Chanjet FY22 revenue was up 12-18% YoY while SaaS subscription 
revenue grew +45% YoY. Implied FY4Q22 revenue was down 18% YoY to 
RMB180mn (vs. +34% YoY in FY9M22). Management hosted a conference call 
and commented that business is slowly recovering since Jan 2023. Chanjet 
targets to achieve +30% YoY in top-line growth and to break-even in FY23E. 
This suggested RMB883mn revenue contribution by small/ micro enterprises to 
Yonyou, missed our prior forecast of RMB1.1bn.   
 Customization for large-enterprises adds margin pressure. We keep our 
view that Yonyou’s cloud migration path is tough with it large enterprise-focused 
strategy (68% of revenue) as these customers (mostly SOEs) are less willing to 
adopt a standardized cloud model. The demand for customization would result 
in extra IT services work. This is in-line with our observation that Yonyou has 
increased its workforce by 4,000 people (+20% YoY) to over 25,000 even in 
FY22. Also, since the company launched its cloud-focused strategy in 2019, 1) 
revenue/ operating profit generated per employee has been decreasing (fig.5-
6) and 2) R&D capitalization rate was up from about 20% to 35%.  
 Maintain HOLD. We cut FY22-24E revenue by 5-6% and derived new target 
price of RMB22.27 (prior RMB23.51), based on unchanged 6.0x FY23E 
EV/sales.

Preliminary FY22 results key points 
Yonyou preliminary FY22 net profit missed 
FY22 net profit attributable to owners of the parent ranges from RMB200mn to RMB220mn 
(down 68.9-71.7% YoY). Excluding non-recurring items, net profit would range between 
RMB85-105mn (down 74.1-79.0% YoY). The decline in net profit was resulted from 
1) COVID resurgence in FY4Q22 
 
Project delivery usually takes place in 4Q. 4Q usually accounted for 45% 
of full year revenue. The COVID resurgence, especially in Dec 2022, has 
resulted in new contract sign and project implementation delay. 
 
FY22 core revenue (software + cloud) delivered YoY increase but the 
growth rate was lower than that in FY21 (+16% YoY). 
 
2) R&D expenses increased with structural change in workforce 
 
Due to the increasing demand in digitalization and localization, Yonyou 
added 4,000+ employees in FY22, resulting in an increase of R&D 
expenses. Meanwhile, Yonyou spent more opex to boost IT partners’ 
project delivery capability in order to fulfil large customers’ demand in 
software customization.  
 
Yonyou plans to raise the profit sharing ratio with their IT partners going 
forward to enhance profitability. 
  
3) Impact from non-operating item in FY21 
 
Yonyou recorded one-off disposal gain of RMB214mn in FY21.  
Chanjet (1588 HK) FY22 profit warning 
Yonyou HK-listed subsidiary Chanjet (1588 HK) announced FY22 profit warning. Yonyou’s 
business targeting small/ micro enterprises is operated through Chanjet and Yonyou holds 
61.85% stake in Chanjet. Management hosted a call on 31 Jan to discuss FY23 outlook.  
 
FY22 revenue: RMB661-697mn (+12-18% YoY). SaaS subscription was up +45% 
YoY. Customer retention and dollar renewal rate also increased YoY but renewal 
rate improvement was not significant.  
 
Implied FY4Q22 revenue: RMB180mn (-18% YoY), vs. +34% YoY in FY9M22.  
 
FY22 net loss: RMB204-222mn (vs. net loss of RMB185.07mn in FY21). 
 
FY23E targets:  
a. Revenue +30% YoY 
b. Limited change in employee scale, will focus on boosting profitability  
c. Target to break-even in FY23E
