Willsemi announced preliminary 2022 net income of RMB800mn to RMB1,200mn, 
showing 73.2% to 82.1% YoY decline. Even a weak 4Q22 was already widely 
anticipated, the results came in significantly below our/consensus forecasts of 
RMB2.46bn/RMB2.97bn. The mgmt. attributed the miss to 1) weak consumer 
electronic market demand (lower rev. and margin), 2) an inventory write down of 
RMB1.3bn to RMB1.5bn (as a result of high inventory base). We see no clear 
sign of recovery of consumer electronic demand in near-term, maintain HOLD 
and revise TP to RMB72.  
 Smartphone demand will remain weak due to ongoing macroeconomics 
pressure. Entering into 2023, worldwide economic environment remains 
challenged, while re-opening in China may boost economy. However, we 
expect its overall impact on consumer electronic demand will be limited in 
short-term. In other words, smartphone/PC will not be the top spending 
categories after reopening, compared to catering, travel, etc. Global 
smartphone shipment is projected to grow only 2%/2.6% YoY according to 
Counterpoint/IDC, despite a low base in 2022 (c.11% decline). Although 4Q22 
may be the worst quarter for Willsemi, we think the low growth of smartphone 
market will cap the Company’s topline recovery in 2023 (44% of CIS rev. 
contribution from mobile).  
 Inventory digestion continues, however, not necessary a hint of market 
turnaround. The mgmt. expected the inventory level would decrease 
meaningfully in 4Q. While inventory digestion will continue in 1Q23, it does 
not necessarily mean the downstream OEMs will increase their orders 
significantly. At this stage of the cycle, we think any meaningful change in 
market confidence (demand side) would be a more valuable catalyst for the 
supply chain (earnings upside and potential revaluation) than a gradually 
decreasing inventory level (supply side). 
 Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB72. As 4Q22 results came in lower than 
estimates, we think demand pressure will persist into 1H23. We revised down 
2023E EPS by 8%. The new TP of RMB72 is based on the same 29.3x 2023E 
P/E. Potential upside include earlier-than-expected consumer demand 
recovery.
