Tigermed (300347 CH) 
 
 
 
Targeting the broad global market 
 
Tigermed reported 2022 revenue/ attributable net income/ attributable recurring net 
income of RMB7,085mn/ RMB2,007mn/ RMB1,540mn, +35.9% YoY/ -30.2% YoY/ 
+25.0% YoY. Revenue was largely in line with our forecast while attributable 
recurring net income missed our forecast by 8.9%. The decline of attributable 
net income in 2022 was mainly due to the decreased fair value gains from 
RMB1,815mn in 2021 to RMB536mn in 2022. Gross profit margin (GPM) 
deteriorated by 3.9ppt to 39.6% in 2022, due to the revenue recognition from 
low-margin COVID-19 related revenue (including pass-through revenue to 
overseas sub-contractors) as well as the COVID pandemic in China. New orders 
amounted to RMB9.7bn in 2022, flattish vs 2021; while non-COVID-19 related 
new orders increased by c.25% YoY in 2022, demonstrating a robust growth of 
the core business. Total backlog reached RMB13.8bn (+22.9% YoY) by the end 
of 2022, a solid guarantee for sustainable growth.  
 Accelerating globalization. Tigermed has utilized COVID-19 pandemic as 
an opportunity to access and expand overseas markets. The Company 
enabled 4 COVID-19 vaccine EUAs in China and overseas in 2022. In 
addition, Tigermed acquired a Croatia-based clinical CRO, Marti Farm, in 
Jan 2023, further enhancing its service capability in Europe. The 
management indicated that the Company will integrate BD team in Europe 
to enhance BD efficiency in 2023. In the US, Tigmerd had collaborations 
with over 100 clinical sites. With its growing global network and good track 
record, Tigermed has won more chances to participate in MRCT projects. 
As of Dec 2022, the Company had 62 MRCT projects in the pipeline, 
compared with only 20 as of Dec 2020. Tigermed also takes a proactive 
approach to explore business opportunities in Southeast Asia and Latin 
America. Such regions are potential end markets for Chinese drug 
developers, which will create additional demand for Tigermed in overseas 
market. To fuel its global expansion, Tigermed added 400 employees in 
overseas regions, representing 44% of the total new hiring in 2022. 
 Adopting new technologies to enhance work efficiency. Tigermed 
established Tigermed Digital Promotion Center and Decentralized Clinical 
Trial (DCT) Solution Team. DCT platform uses new technologies to perform 
critical clinical trial related procedures, such as participant enrolment/ 
engagement, site management, data aggregation, quality/ cost balance and 
study services. DCT platform, already used in certain projects, will reduce 
patient burden and improve clinical service efficiency. We think the launch 
of DCT platform will help Tigermed to keep up with leading foreign peers 
regarding service digitalization and work efficiency.  
 Maintain BUY. We revised our TP from RMB147.43 to RMB134.24, based 
on a 10-year DCF model (WACC: 10.6%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%), to 
factor in slower revenue growth projection. We forecast Tigermed’s revenue 
to grow 20%/ 26%/ 25% YoY and attributable recurring net income to grow 
29%/ 27%/ 26% YoY in FY23E/ 24E/ 25E, respectively.
