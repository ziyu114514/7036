Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH) 
 
 
 
Positive takeaways from plant visit; U/G to BUY 
 
We upgrade Hengli to BUY from Hold for the first time since May 2021. We 
are turning positive after visiting Hengli’s production base last week. In the near 
term (coming months), we believe the growth (YoY) of excavator hydraulic 
cylinder production in Mar, after going through a declining trend since late 2021, 
suggests an early sign of turnaround of downstream demand. Besides, 
production of AWP motor in Mar is expected to reach a record high, which 
reaffirms our positive stance on AWP. From a long-term perspective (1-3 
years), continuous market share gain in pump & valves, as well as penetration 
into global agricultural machinery component market will offer high visibility to 
Hengli’s earnings. In addition, the commencement of production base in Mexico 
(estimated annual output value of RMB1.5-2.0bn) in 3Q23E will help speed up 
the penetration in the US market. We revise up our 2023E/24E earnings forecast 
by 1%/10%. Our TP is raised to RMB90, based on 42x 2023E P/E, 1SD above 
the 4-year average of 30x to reflect the acceleration of earnings growth.     
 Excavator hydraulic cylinder growth turns positive in Mar. We 
understand that Hengli has scheduled production of 64k units of excavator 
hydraulic cylinder in Mar, which represents 12% growth YoY. We believe 
the growth is largely driven by Chinese OEM’s orders.    
 Growth of excavator pump & valve to continue in 2023E. While Hengli 
has high market share in pump & valve for small-size excavator (>50%), the 
share in medium-large size excavator is only ~15%. We see a high chance 
for Hengli to achieve further market share gain given the solid track record 
in cylinder, pump & valve (small-size).    
 Agricultural machinery component growth to accelerate. Hengli offers 
motors, pumps & valves for agricultural machinery such as cotton pickers 
and combined harvesters. These components carry shorter useful life than 
that of excavator given the continuous operation of the pumping system. 
This implies a large aftersales market. Against the backdrop of supply chain 
disruption in Europe, Hengli captures the opportunity of penetrating into the 
agriculture machinery component market in Europe. We forecast Hengli to 
achieve RMB500mn revenue in overseas in 2023E (up 100%+ YoY). In 
China market, we expect the import substitution trend will offer large growth 
potential given the low base.      
 AWP motor: Surprise on the upside. Hengli’s production volume of motor 
(largely for AWP) is expected to reach 23k in Mar, representing 90%+ 
growth. We see potential for Hengli to continue to penetrate into the global 
AWP motor market as overseas AWP OEMs are facing supply chain 
bottleneck. As a cross check, Hengli’s strong production figure in Mar also 
reaffirms our bullish view on Zhejiang Dingli (603338 CH, BUY).

Valuation  
 
We upgrade Hengli to BUY from Hold, with a new TP of RMB90 (up from RMB58). We roll 
over our valuation base to 2023E and set our TP based on 42x 2023E P/E, equivalent to 
1SD above the 4-year average of 30x (our previous TP was based 30x 2022E). Our above-
average P/E is to reflect the acceleration of earnings growth.
