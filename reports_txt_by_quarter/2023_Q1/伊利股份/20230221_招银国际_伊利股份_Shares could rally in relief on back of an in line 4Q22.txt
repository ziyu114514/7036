We see trading opportunity on Yili into results season. This would mainly be 
underpinned by 1) an easy and stabilizing earnings expectation (for both 4Q22 
and 2023E), when we see subdued downside risk to current consensus estimates, 
and 2) a lagging valuation to peers who have already been re-rated on reopening 
sentiment. We argue the stock could play near term catch-up, when a likely in 
line 4Q could relieve market sentiment. We are buy-rated on Yili, but prefer to 
stick to CR Beer (291HK, Buy), Proya (603605CH, Buy) and CTGDF (601888CH, 
Buy) as our preferred plays around this early-staged consumption-led recovery. 
 4Q momentum showed sequential pick-up. We forecast 4Q revenue to 
grow 6% YoY to RMB27bn. Momentum in October and November has been 
weak, and a more obvious recovery has kicked-in in December. This was 
driven by acceleration of liquid milk demand as a result of healthy restocking 
momentum for the CNY in Jan 2023. GPM is likely to show QoQ improvement 
thanks to higher gifting demand that improved sales mix. Opex ratio will 
decline YoY without much eventful spending (winter Olympic last year). 
Meanwhile, we expect a flattish NPM at 8% for 2022.  
 2023E outlook. Overall we expect revenue growth to edge up from 2022E, 
driven by accelerated liquid milk sales, from flattish in 2022 to about 5% 
growth in 2023E. IMF business should remain high-growth, but from a high 
base of 2022, we assert a 25% YoY growth for the segment. This is consistent 
with management target of a 20% 4-year CAGR between 2021-25E. While 
birth rate looks to have troughed, we do not expect it to rebound until late-23E. 
In this case, given a muted segment growth, we would expect Yili to take up 
market share from peers. For instance, Yili took up 11% of the market by end-
22, compared to 9% in 2021. Separately, low-temp SKU could maintain a 25-
30% YoY growth and we consider the temperature of summer this year the 
major swing factor to our assumption.  
 Earnings change. Our 2022E estimates are largely unchanged. We have 
lowered our 2023E GPM by 0.4pp and this led to a 4.2% cut in net profits. 
Now, we assume Yili’s net margins to expand by an average of 0.5pp over 
2023-24E and this largely tallies with management’s expectation.  
 Valuation. Our new TP is based on an unchanged 25.0x rolled-forward end-23E 
PE, which still benchmarks to its 3-year average. We believe our methodology 
appropriately reflects Yili’s sequential recovery that begins from 4Q22.
