Owing to a weak but expected 4Q earnings, CTGDF’s recent share price has 
pulled back by 10%+ to its pre-reopening level. While lockdown risk has already 
behind us, we again see buying opportunity when earnings momentum, in our 
view, troughed, and subsequently picks up within 1H23E. Our call is further 
supported by channel check findings in which 1) YTD DF sales still tracking 20%+, 
2) inelastic procurement demand from reseller given the prevailing logistic 
bottleneck and less favorable rebate policy with Korea DF, and 3) a very 
disciplined discount policy. We are buyers of CTGDF, and believe the stock would 
see a relief rally towards result season driven by management’s 2023 outlook 
and sentiment recovery towards the 5.1 Golden week. 
 We raise 2023E revenue by 9%, mainly driven by 1) a net 9% higher airport 
DF revenue of RMB16.6bn (offset by lower online revenue), which we assert 
offline foot traffic and spending per visitor to generally recover to c55% of 2019, 
and 2) Hainan offshore revenue of RMB62.3bn, in which we assume CTGDF 
to share 78% of Hainan government’s target of RMB80bn. These, however, 
were mitigated by a 0.2pp ramp up in opex ratio, and hence a muted net profits 
change. Our 2023E forecasts remain c25% below consensus. 
 4Q was below us but momentum has been normalizing. Although net 
profits came in below us/ consensus, revenue has showed a 29% sequential 
QoQ improvement. While results details were not available, we expect the 
quarter’s GPM to show similar trend given 1) discounts has started to narrow 
from mid-Dec in view of better foot traffic upon the removal of social distancing 
policy, and 2) a rising contribution from accessories of which a higher GPM is 
supported by better pricing dynamics. Meanwhile, these were likely eroded by 
start-up costs induced by the new Haikou shopping mall.  
 Valuation. Our earnings is little changed. Our TP is still based on 50.0x end-
23E P/E, which represents its average since June 2020, when market started 
to re-rate the stock for a series of policy tailwind. We believe our methodology 
has appropriately priced-in the recent market sentiment about China’s gradual 
reopening progress.  
 Positive catalysts: domestic and overseas acquisition, sentiment recovery 
towards 5.1 Golden week.
