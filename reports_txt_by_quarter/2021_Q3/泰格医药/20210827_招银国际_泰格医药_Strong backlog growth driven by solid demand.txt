 1H21 earnings beat. Tigermed reported 1H21 revenue/ attributable net profit 
of RMB2,056mn/ RMB1,255mn, increased by 42%/ 26% YoY, accounting for 
48%/ 88% of our full-year estimate. Attributable recurring net profit grew 79% 
YoY to RMB543mn in 1H21, which accounted for 58% of our full-year estimate. 
Tigermed booked RMB906mn fair value gains and RMB113mn investment 
gains in 1H21, totaling 64% of its total net profit. Despite negative impact from 
RMB appreciation, Tigermed’s overseas revenue still registered a remarkable 
55% YoY growth in 1H21, contributing 54% of the Company’s total revenue. 
 Expect the recovery trend to continue in 2021. During 1H21, Tigermed’s 
new bookings reached RMB5,074.8mn, representing a 150.8% YoY growth. 
Such a strong growth was driven by 1) increasing R&D spending in innovation 
therapies and medical devices, 2) recovery of R&D activities from the 
pandemic and 3) the increased demand of clinical trials for COVID-19 
vaccines and therapies. Revenue from clinical trial solutions (CTS) reached 
RMB1,034mn in 1H21, up 45% YoY, while the growth was primarily driven by 
the increased revenue from clinical trial operation services. As of 30 Jun 2021, 
Tigermed is conducting 491 ongoing drug clinical research projects, up from 
389 projects as of end-2020, indicating sustainable income growth for 
Tigermed. In addition, revenue generated from clinical-related laboratory 
services (CRLS) increased 38.0% YoY to RMB1,022.8mn, mainly thanks to 
the recovery of operation of US lab services and SMO services from the 
pandemic. 
 Accelerating global expansion driven by booming demand. As Chinese 
biotech and medical device companies are increasingly developing products 
in global markets, Tigermed benefits from increasing overseas clinical trial 
demand from Chinese clients.  Having been a pioneer in global expansion, as 
of 30 Jun 2021, Tigermed is conducting 111 single region clinical trials 
overseas and 29 MRCTs. During 1H21, Tigermed has acquired over 
RMB800mn new MRCT bookings with bidding successful rate reaching over 
30%. Tigermed grew its number of overseas-based employee from 772 by 
end-2020 to 854 by mid-2021, with strong presence across the Asia-Pacific 
region, North America, Europe, Latin America and Africa. 
 Maintain BUY. We revised up our FY21E/ 22E/ 23E attributable net profit 
forecasts by 48%/ 19%/ 18% to reflect the strong growth outlook. We lifted our 
new DCF-based TP to RMB198.40 (WACC: 9.84%, Terminal growth: 3.0%).
