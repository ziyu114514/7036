Hikvision FY2Q21 beat our estimates as revenue continued to rebound strongly 
(+34% YoY). Key highlight of FY1H21 is the innovative business: (1) revenue 
grew +122% YoY to RMB5.6bn (16% of revenue) and (2) gross margin +3.1 pct 
pts YoY to 42% (vs. core surveillance 47%). Also, high inventory level strategy 
helps secure customers amid global raw material shortage. Maintain BUY and 
raised target price to RMB80.00 (prior RMB75.65).  
 FY2Q21 beat. Revenue was at RMB19.9bn (+34% YoY), and net profit was 
at RMB4.3bn (+38% YoY). GPM missed (-5.3 pct pts YoY to 45.9%) on higher 
raw material price and product mix change. Opex control was better than 
expected with opex ratio of 26.4% (vs. CMBI estimate 28.1%). R&D expense 
increased 19% YoY while G&A expense declined 8% YoY. Net profit was 
boosted by tax credit (RMB570mn) that usually came in 3Q instead of 2Q. On 
operating level, profit was up +26% YoY to RMB3.9bn.  
 Innovative business taking shape. We maintain our view that Hikvision is 
more than a surveillance company as camera applications are expanded by 
embedding AI/ sensor technology. Innovative business segments (smart 
home products/ robotics/ thermal/ x-ray products etc.) revenue was up +122% 
YoY to RMB5.6bn in FY1H21 and revenue contribution reached 16%. It is also 
positive to see innovative business GPM improvement (+3.1 pct pts to 41.6% 
in FY1H21), narrowing the gap with core surveillance GPM 47.2%. 
 High raw material level ensures stable supply to customers. Hikvision has 
adopted high inventory level strategy since Hisilicon ban in 2019. This helps 
secure customers in FY1H21 amid global raw material shortage, especially 
for SMBG (revenue +106% YoY) and overseas business (+26%YoY). 
Inventory level increased further to RMB15.1bn (+35% YoY) in FY2Q21, of 
which RMB6.9bn are raw materials (+35% YoY). Customers are accepting 
shorter credit period to ensure stable supply and thus AR days shortened to 
114 in FY2Q21 (vs. 139 in FY2Q20). However, if raw material price hike 
persists, Hikvision could face increasing margin pressure.  
 Maintain BUY. We raised FY21-23E net profit by 5-7% to reflect stronger top-
line growth and better opex control. Maintain BUY with new target price of 
RMB80.00 (based on unchanged 36x FY22 P/E). Key downside risk is that 
chip shortage may last for longer than expected.

Valuation  
Hikvision (002415 CH, BUY, TP RMB80.00) 
We raised our target price to RMB80.00 (prior RMB75.65), based on unchanged 36x FY22 
P/E, 50% above its 3-year mean. We believe Hikvision deserves re-rating as supply chain 
risk is mitigated after two years of product re-design. Also, strong growth in innovative 
business proves Hikvision transformation to an intelligent camera solution provider rather 
than a pure surveillance company. Hikvision announced plan to spin off its smart home 
business (Ezviz Network) on STAR board. We believe the spin-off could provide new 
financing channel to support IoT/ AI R&D.
