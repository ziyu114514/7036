Willsemi released 1H21 results last night, with revenue/NP growth of 55%/127% 
YoY, in line with previous announcement. 1H21 revenue/NP accounted for 
43%/46% and 45%/48% of our/consensus FY21E estimates. The GPM improved 
to 33.7% from 29.9% in FY20 due to favorable product mix. Looking forward, we 
are positive on the Company’s expansion driven by high growth in non-
mobile CIS segments and GPM improvement. We reiterate BUY rating on 
Willsemi, an established player with diversified product portfolio, with unchanged 
TP of RMB 370.75. 
 Solid growth in mobile CIS and greater-than-expected contribution from 
non-mobile CIS. Although there are mixed views on smartphone camera 
spec, we believe mobile CIS will continue to deliver solid results on 
smartphone updates. Meanwhile, the Company’s mgmt. emphasizes greater 
potentials beyond mobile market, which has stronger demand and higher 
GPM. We believe earnings contribution from non-mobile CIS will surpass 
mobile CIS in FY22E thanks to rapid growth in automobile, security, AR/VR 
and medical.  
 Recent price increase from foundries due to semi shortage has limited 
impact on the Company. First, Willsemi’s capacity is well protected by the 
agreement with the foundries. Its two main wafer suppliers, SMIC and HLMC, 
will expand its capacity by next year, which will support production for the 
Company. Second, we believe semi shortage is a global event that affects all 
players. Backed by strong demand, we think the Company is able to transfer 
the cost pressure to clients and deliver higher GPM. 
 Reiterate BUY rating with unchanged TP of RMB370.75. We derive our TP 
of RMB370.75 by applying 50x FY22E P/E. We believe this valuation is 
justified given 1) its leading position in CIS market with global presence and 
2) its integrated semiconductor platform with diversified product portfolio. We 
view recent correction as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain 
exposure to quality Chinese semi fabless names that can ride strategic trends. 
Willsemi is currently trading 1-sd below historical P/E, which is very attractive.  
 Potential risks include 1) slower market growth, 2) intensified competition, 3) 
worse-than-expected semi shortage and 4) new disruptive technology.

Valuation 
Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB370.75 (44% upside) 
We reiterate BUY rating with TP of RMB370.75, as we think Willsemi is an established 
player with diversified product portfolio. We derive our TP by applying 50x FY22E P/E, 
1 SD above the 2-year historical forward P/E. We believe this valuation is justified given 1) 
its leading position in CIS market with a global presence, 2) its integrated semiconductor 
platform with diversified product portfolio and 3) expected share gain due to business 
expansion and advances in technology.  
We take the recent volatility as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain 
exposure to quality Chinese semi fabless names that can ride strategic trends. The 
stock is now trading at 34.5x 2022E P/E vs. 53.4x of its peers.  
Potential risks include 1) less-than-expected market growth, 2) intensified competition, 3) 
worse-than-expected semi shortage and 4) new disruptive technology.
