 1H21 earnings beat. WuXi AppTec reported 1H21 revenue of RMB10.54bn 
(+46% YoY), accounting for 47% of our full-year estimate. Such a strong 
growth was underpinned by its unique end-to-end full-service platform. By 
segment, revenue from CDMO services surged 67% YoY, while China-based 
lab service and clinical research & other CRO services registered 45% YoY 
and 57% YoY growth, respectively. Due to sustained impact of COVID 
pandemic as well as delays and clinical failures in clients’ products, revenue 
from US-based laboratory services decreased 16% YoY, accounting for 6% 
of total revenue. Attributable net profit and adjusted non-IFRS net profit grew 
by 88%/ 68% YoY to RMB2,127mn/ RMB2,448mn, respectively. 
 CDMO services act as growth engine. In 1H21, CDMO revenue rallied 67% 
YoY to RMB3,599mn, accounting for 34% of the total revenue. In 1H21, 341 
out of 1,413 molecules were newly added into CDMO services pipeline, 
including 1/ 19 Ph III/ II stage project additions via “win the molecule” strategy. 
As at Jun 2021, the Company provided CDMO services for about 14% of the 
global innovative small molecule drug pipeline compared with 11.5% in 2019, 
indicating consistent market share gain. 4 pipeline molecules went 
commercial in 1H21, including 1 full CMC project (HutchMed’s Savolitinib). 
The Company is rapidly scaling up the manufacturing of two novel small 
molecules for treating COVID-19 infections for big MNCs. After establishing a 
JV (WuXi XDC) with WuXi Biologics, the Company’s ADC (antibody drug 
conjugate) CDMO client number increased 57% YoY in 1H21. 
 Proposed new incentive scheme. The Company proposed a HK$2bn H 
share award and trust scheme with the target of above 34% YoY revenue 
growth in 2021. In addition, the Company initiated a Shareholder Alignment 
Incentive (SAI) scheme for senior management with the total incentive amount 
up to HK$7.5bn. The incentive pools are HK$1bn/ HK$1.5bn/ HK$2bn and 
HK$3bn if the H-share price hits HK$170/ HK$187/ HK$204/ HK$238, 
respectively. We think the new incentive scheme will further help align the 
interests between management and shareholders. 
 Maintain BUY. We revised up adjusted Non-IFRS net profit of FY21/22/23E 
by 8%/3%/3%, and forecast the adjusted Non-IFRS net profit to grow 
43%/29%/34% YoY in FY21E/22E/23E respectively. Moreover, WuXi 
AppTec’s diversified investment portfolio will bring significant investment 
gains over the long term. Considering the increased outstanding shares, we 
revised our 10-year DCF-based TP to RMB168.06 (WACC: 9.74%, Terminal 
growth: 3.0%).
