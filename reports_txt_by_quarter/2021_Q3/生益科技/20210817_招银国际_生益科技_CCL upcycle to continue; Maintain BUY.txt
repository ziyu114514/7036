Shengyi Tech reported 1H21 results with revenue of RMB9.8bn (43% YoY) and 
net profit of RMB1.4bn (71% YoY),largely in-line with its preannounced earnings 
earlier. We believe Shengyi’s solid results confirmed the upcycle for CCL 
segment. Although PCB business remains under pressure due to rising raw 
material costs which partially offset the growth from CCL, we remain positive on 
Shengyi Tech’s outlook. We revised up FY21-23E EPS by 3-12% and raised TP 
to RMB31.90. Maintain BUY.  
 Strong 2Q21 results driven by CCL upcycle; PCB business remains 
weak. By segment, CCL/pregreg revenue/net profit grew 62%/171% YoY 
and PCB grew revenue/net profit declined 25%/66% YoY. CCL/pregreg GPM 
is flattish QoQ at 29.3% in 2Q21 (vs 29.3%/26.4% for 1Q21/2Q20), while 
PCB GPM continued to decline to 16.0% (vs. 21.6%/28.5% for 1Q21/2Q20). 
As global No.2 CCL supplier, we believe Shengyi Tech was able to transfer 
the material cost pressure to downstream PCB manufacturers. However, 
blended GPM decreased to 25.7% in 2Q21 (vs 27.9% in 1Q21) given 1) 
deteriorated margin from PCB business and 2) limited margin upside from 
CCL business as rising costs may curb downstream demand. 
 Expect another strong quarter in 3Q and stable 4Q may have higher 
uncertainty. Looking forward, we think the Company will deliver a strong 
3Q21 given peak season and high order visibility. We believe 1) auto market 
will continue its momentum and remain as the key driver for CCL and 2) 
telecom equipment demand will pick up given that 5G deployment has 
resumed with stable GPM and ASP. Overall, we think 2H revenue growth will 
be similar to 1H given 1) limited room for CCL suppliers to increase ASP and 
2) increasing demand uncertainty from downstream clients in 4Q due to high 
cost pressure.  
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB31.90. We slightly adjusted our TP to 
RMB31.90 based on higher earnings forecasts and lower 25.0x FY22/P/E (vs 
previous 30x due to limited CCL ASP upside and demand uncertainty). 
Trading at 23.2x/20.7x FY21/22E P/E, the stock remains attractive. Potential 
risks include less-than-expected transfer of material costs and less-than-
expected market demand.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with new TP at RMB31.90 (21% upside)  
We maintain BUY rating with slightly adjusted TP of RMB31.90 based on lower 25x FY22E 
P/E. We believe the valuation is justified given that there is limited room for CCL ASP to 
increase and potential uncertainty in downstream demand due to material cost pressure. 
Trading at 23.2x/20.7x FY21/22E P/E, the stock remains attractive. Potential risks include 
less-than-expected transfer of material costs and less-than-expected market demand.
