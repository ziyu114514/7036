Jingsheng announced last night that the Company won a contract of RMB6.08bn 
from Ningxia Zhonghuan (a subsidiary of Zhonghuan [002129 CH, NR]) to 
deliver automated crystal growing furnaces. We see this as a big positive to 
Jingsheng, given that the contract amount represents an addition of 53% on top 
of Jingsheng’s backlog of RMB11.5bn (as at end-Jun 2021). The new contract 
reaffirms our confidence on the robust solar capex story. Given that Jingsheng 
will start the product delivery to Ningxia Zhonghuan in Nov 2021, we revise up 
our 2022E-23E earnings forecast by 17% for each year. We revise up our TP to 
RMB112. Reiterate BUY with conviction. 
 Details of the contract. On 31 Aug, Jingsheng signed a sales contract with 
Ningxia Zhonghuan. Jingsheng will deliver automated crystal growing furnace 
to Ningxia Zhonghuan. The contract value reaches RMB6.08bn (VAT-
included). Product delivery will begin in Nov 2021 while the actual delivery 
schedule will be subject to Ningxia Zhonghuan’s notice. Cash collection will 
be divided into five stages: (1) down-payment, (2) product delivery, (3) product 
acceptance, (4) testing, and (5) warranty.     
 Jingsheng continues to be the major beneficiary of Zhonghuan’s 
aggressive capex growth. Zhonghuan has been Jingsheng’s largest 
customer. According to Zhonghuan’s latest share placement plan, Zhonghuan 
plans to raise a total of RMB9bn to finance the capex on 50GW of G12 mono-
wafer capacity. Ningxia Zhonghuan will be the entity to execute the project. 
The construction lead time is expected to be 15 months. Therefore, we 
forecast the revenue contribution to Jingsheng will be in 2022E-23E.         
 TP revised up. We lift our TP to RMB112 from RMB77.5, as we roll over our 
valuation base to 2022E as the solid backlog offers good visibility to the 
earnings in 2022E-23E. Our new TP is based on 56x FY22E earnings on the 
back of 56% EPS CAGR in 2021E-23E (equivalent to 1x PEG).  
 Risk: 1) Weaker or slower-than-expected solar power capacity expansion; 2) 
lower-than-expected gross margin; (3) unsuccessful acquisition.
