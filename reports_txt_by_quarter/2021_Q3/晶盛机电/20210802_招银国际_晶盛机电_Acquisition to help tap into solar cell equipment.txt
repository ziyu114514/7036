Jingsheng announced last Friday that the Company will set up a JV with Applied 
Materials (AMAT US). The JV will acquire from Applied Materials the screen 
printing equipment business in Italy, wafer inspection business in Singapore and 
the related business in China. This is an important move for Jingsheng to expand 
its product mix on wafer equipment. More importantly, the acquisition can help 
Jingsheng to tap into the solar cell equipment field immediately. We see strong 
synergies through combining the technology of Advanced Materials and the 
manufacturing capability of Jingsheng. Reiterate BUY. 
 Key highlights of the acquisition. Jingsheng will set up a JV with Applied 
Materials Hong Kong (stake: Jingsheng: 65%; Applied Materials: 35%). The 
total registered capital will be US$150mn (~RMB970mn). The JV will then 
acquire from Applied Materials the screen printing equipment business in Italy, 
wafer inspection business in Singapore and the related business in China, for 
a consideration of US$120mn (~RMB775mn). This implies 5x P/B (equity at 
end-Jan 2021: US$24.2mn). The board of the JV will include five members, 
including three representatives from Jingsheng and two from Applied 
Materials. The acquisition is subject to the approval by the authorities in both 
China and Italy.  
 A major move to expand playing fields. The inclusion of wafer inspection 
equipment will expand Jingsheng’s product offerings (current focus: crystal 
growing and wafer slicing). On the other hand, screen printing equipment will 
become Jingsheng’s first product in the field of solar cell equipment. At 
present, Suzhou Maxwell (300751 CH, NR) is the leading screen printer 
maker in China (see our note “Leading screen printing equipment maker 
penetrating into HJT cell production equipment” [link]). We believe, by 
leveraging Applied Materials technology and Jingsheng manufacturing 
capability, Jingsheng will be capable to challenge the incumbent.       
 TP revised up. We maintain our earnings forecast but lift our TP to RMB77.5 
from RMB60.90, based on 67x FY21E P/E, equivalent to 1.4x PEG (previously 
1.1x). Our higher target PEG is to reflect the additional growth potential from 
the latest acquisition and the recent breakthroughs in the 12-inch crystal 
growing furnace in semiconductor segment.  
 Risk: 1) Weaker or slower-than-expected solar power capacity expansion; 2) 
lower-than-expected gross margin; (3) unsuccessful acquisition.
