LONGi’s 1H21/2Q21 results beat our expectation, despite the chaotic operating 
environment during the period. The Company managed to pass through 
upstream cost pressures through a series of price hike, and Poly-Si inventory 
also helped sustain 1H21 gross profit margin (declined only 0.9ppt QoQ). Mgmt. 
was cautious about 2H21 outlook, but we think pressures can still be passed 
through as wafer price is now standing at year high. We cut TP slightly from 
RMB110 to RMB105, reflecting 39.6x FY22E PER. Maintain BUY. 
 2Q21 results beat. LONGi realized 1H21 revenue of RMB35bn, up 67% YoY. 
Revenue growth was mainly driven by module sales volume increased by 
152.4% YoY. Selling expenses exhibited significant increment due to 
overseas shipping costs hike, while other major expenses remained largely 
stable. 1H21 net profit was RMB4,993mn, up 21% YoY, implying 2Q21 net 
profit of RMB2,491mn, largely flat as 1Q21. In view of chaotic supply chain 
and sluggish downstream demand, we appreciate LONGi’s performance, and 
the result beat our expectations.  
 Cost pressures to pass through to downstream. LONGi realized 
surprisingly good wafer margin during 1H21, through 1) releasing low cost 
Poly-Si inventory, and 2) passing through cost pressures via price hike. We 
estimate the Company boosted ASP by more than 42% through six rounds of 
price hike in 1H21, which successfully sustained the Company’s profitability. 
Looking forward, since effective wafer supply is constrained by Poly-Si input, 
we expect the cost pass-through mechanism will continue until cell 
manufacturers cannot afford, and that will likely sustain wafer margin in 2H21E.  
 Full year direction still on course. LONGi maintained full year shipment 
target of 80GW wafer/40GW module unchanged, and realized run rate of 
48%/43% respectively in 1H21. Mgmt. saw module sales challenging, as 
module price had increased to critical level at RMB1.80/watt, and further price 
hike will suppress grid-parity solar installation demand. During 1H21, low price 
order signed in 4Q20 had squeezed module GPM. In 2H21E, as module ASP 
picks up and reflects upstream costs movement, we expect module pressure 
to be eased. Supported by advantages of integrated supply chain, we expect 
LONGi to achieve its ambitious module sales target.   
 Trim TP slightly to RMB105. LONGi is trading at 38x/34x FY21/22E PER, 
leading solar peers. Valuation looks a bit rich, but we think LONGi is still on a rapid 
expanding track. Based on 39.6x FY22 PER, we derive our TP of RMB105. 
Maintain BUY.

 Hydrogen equipment: a new direction. LONGi established a new team for 
hydrogen business. The Company will position itself as hydrogen equipment 
and solution provider in near term to explore business potential of the new 
direction. Mgmt. would like to combine solar technology with hydrogen 
equipment as a comprehensive solution for the business, and expect to have 
1.5-2GW hydrogen equipment manufacturing capacity by end-2022.  
 Lift earnings outlook by 4.3-6.5% in FY21-23E. Based on revision on wafer and 
module price assumption, and LONGi’s unexpected high cost pass-through 
capability, we lifted FY21-23E earnings slightly by 4.3%/5.2%/6.5% to 
RMB10,794/14,353/17,453mn respectively.   
 Risk factors: 1) PV installation demand turns weak in 4Q21; 2) potential 
wafer price war flips cost pass-through mechanism.
