Travel bans in view of the outbreak of Delta Variant in Guangzhou and Nanjing 
is likely to weigh on 3Q domestic travel momentum. That said, when the 
pandemic gradually dies down and when vaccination surpasses 2.1bn times, we 
see scope for domestic travel to normalize into 4Q, particularly when the quarter 
is clustered with various festivals and shopping campaigns that catalyze leisure 
travelling and shopping. CTGDF is the largest domestic duty-free operator with 
90%+ market share in 2020, and is therefore poised to be the major beneficiary 
of this recovery trajectory. The stock is trading at 30.9x end-22E P/E, at par to its 
3-year average but -2sd below its 1-year average, when the stock was re-rated 
on policy tailwind. We argue shares mean-reversion is likely to take place towards 
4Q, not to mention value to be unlocked through its secondary H share listing on 
an expanded shareholder base. We initiate the stock at Buy with TP of RMB350.0. 
 Hainan expansion a major driver to offer 51.0% CAGR to duty-free 
revenue. We project a 42.3% 3-year revenue CAGR for CTGDF during 2020-
23E. We forecast duty-free sales to grow at a 51.0% CAGR during the same 
period, which will be underpinned by its organic expansion in Haitang Bay 
Phase 2 and Haikou International Duty-free Mall. The expansion is 
debottlenecking to CTGDF, in our view, as a larger store space will enable 
CTGDF to enrich its product shelving and display, across its brand portfolio.  
 Potential earnings upside on rental renegotiation and tax concession. 
We believe rental renegotiation for Beijing airport could enhance operating 
leverage, while Hainan’s potential tax concession approval could boost 
2021/22E net profits by approximately 8%, in our estimate. Separately, owing 
to a rising online/ lower-margins SKU mix, we expect pressure to gross 
margins to prevail until 2022E when a more centralized procurement strategy, 
recovering offline traffic and the SKU mix upgrade could revive the trend. 
 Valuation at its low-cycle 30.9x P/E; we are c5% ahead of 22E consensus. 
Our target price of RMB350.0 is based on 43.0x end-22E P/E, which 
represents +1sd above the average of the last 3 years. Our multiple is also 
benchmarked to the average valuation of 44.0x since July 2020. This explains 
our near-term expectation for CTGDF’s share price to mean-revert as if 
domestic travel and spending were to recover as we are heading to a more 
festive 4Q. Our 2021E earnings is slightly below consensus, while that of 
2022E is c6% above.

Investment Thesis 
Stabilizing spending and travellers to Hainan  
The recent resurgence of COVID-19 cases that mostly found in the Guangdong area (14 
communities labelled as medium/high risk) has again reignited concerns over renewed 
travel bans. The duty-free spending and the number of domestic travelers to Hainan have 
stabilized in June and July, and the average visitation of the last 3 months remained 
comparable to the pre-COVID level at approximately 5mn per month. Of the total, 55% of 
the visits were paid to Haikou and Sanya.

Separately, on a per visitor basis, there was no sign of a slowdown in spending which has 
increased by 20% YoY to approximately RMB6,400, in our estimates. The number actually 
tallied with the data announced by the Haikou Custom that offshore duty-free spending per 
visitor amounted to RMB7,002, given a total spending of RMB26.7bn with 3.8mn of 
shoppers.

Pandemic largely under control by end-Aug; reasonable 2022 expectation  
According to the National Health Commission, by end of August, infections in most of 
the medium/ high-risk communities have largely reduced and domestic travels have 
started to resume. Year-to-date, the number of vaccination has reached 2.1bn, and 
this should set stage for domestic travel to recover towards 4Q, particularly when the 
quarter is clustered with various traditional Chinese festivals that catalyze leisure 
travelling and shopping.  
Barring any lingering COVID cases towards the end of 2021, Frost and Sullivan 
estimated the number of domestic tourists would return to the pre-pandemic level in 
2022E. Furthermore, the number of domestic tourists will grow further to 10.6bn units 
in 2025E, registering a 4-year CAGR of 19.9%.

An unchallenged leadership despite relaxed entry regulation 
Although there have been new entrants to China’s travel retail market in the recent years, 
we hold the view that CTGDF will be able to leverage its first-mover advantage as well as 
its edges in rapid store expansion, a rich product portfolio, and a well-tailored customer 
loyalty program to secure its market share.  
 
Industry and operation experience makes high entry barrier to new entrants  
Duty-free market in China is highly concentrated and has a high entry barrier. In 2020, 
according to Frost and Sullivan, the top five duty-free travel retailers in China accounted 
for 99.9% of the market share, with CTGDF being the no.1 player with a market share of 
92.3%.  
 
Figure 10: Top 5 duty-free merchandise operators ranking (by retail sales), China, 2020 
 
 
 
Source: Company data, Frost & Sullivan, CMBIS 
 
CTGDF was among 10 groups of entities with duty-free operation permits in China and 
among six groups of entities with duty-free operation permits to operate duty-free port 
stores nationwide. Meanwhile, the Company is currently the only group with operation 
permits for all types of duty-free stores in China. In particular, the Company enjoys 
substantial competitive advantages in Hainan, occupying approximately 99.8% of China’s 
offshore duty-free market share in 2020, according to Frost & Sullivan. Although the 
restrictions to enter into the duty-free market has been relaxed in recent years, we believe 
new entrants will not be able to shake up the market dynamics in the near term, as they 
would struggle with various operation challenges given the lack of industry experience, as 
well as supply management.

1) 
Industry Experience  
Current players in the market are all state-owned companies with long-time industry 
operation history. The bidding on duty-free projects requires comprehensive 
assessments including the store layout design, marketing and customer service 
strategies, business plan and brand introduction. New entrants would have difficulties 
providing a comprehensive and profitable business plan compared to mature players 
with abundant duty-free operation experience.  
2) 
Supplier management  
Brand portfolio of duty-free businesses largely comprises global luxury brands. These 
brands normally engage in business relationship with well-established duty-free 
operators with sound financial muscle and international presence, not to mention the 
ability to secure stable and high volumes of purchase orders. This is also crucial for 
duty-free operators to gain bargaining power with brand owners to protect margins.  
3) 
Continuous new store expansion  
CTGDF has made cleared that the Company will continue to compete for concessions 
at airports and other transportation terminals and destinations with a number of other 
global, national and regional duty-free operators in China and at popular overseas 
destinations for Chinese travelers. Beyond its existing domestic airport operations, the 
Company also planned to extend its coverage to other airports in Ningbo, Yiwu, Jinan, 
Jiaxing with target commencement date within 2021. Separately, CTGDF intends to 
open its new offshore store in Hainan, the Haikou International Duty-Free Complex, 
with an estimated sales area of 150,000 sq m in 2022E. Of note, currently, it operates 
a total of 194 stores, six oversea duty-free stores in Hong Kong, Macau and Cambodia, 
and 188 stores in Mainland China covering more than 90 cities, spanning across 29 
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions.

A rich product offering   
CTGDF secures a product portfolio with more than 200,000 SKUs, ranging from 
perfume and cosmetics, fashion and accessories, tobacco and liquor, and food and 
miscellaneous goods. 
In our view, CTGDF’s competitive advantage of having a wide variety of brand and product 
selections is underpinned by its centralized procurement (that ensures large and steady 
order flows to brand owners) and an improved window-display opportunity and distribution 
channel through our network of 194 shops across China, Hong Kong, Macau and 
Cambodia. For instance, by end-2020, CTGDF connected with 946 brands globally that 
consisted of 111 perfume and cosmetics brands, 155 fashion and accessories brands, 467 
tobacco and liquor brands and 213 food brands). The strong franchise has created a strong 
moat for CTGDF to keep away from its competitors for any direct competition.

Enjoying policy tailwind; and we expect more to come 
To revive the duty-free market that has been significantly hit by COVID-19, the Chinese 
government enacted a series of policies to promote the growth and development of the 
duty-free industry including measures to encourage offshore duty-free shopping and the 
development of integrated travel retail complex and downtown duty-free stores. In our view, 
with the below policy aids, Hainan is poised to reach RMB100bn DFS sale target by 2022E.

We await relaxation on purchase of imported necessities for Hainan residents   
The next supportive policy announcement, according to the Chinese government in 
December 2020, relates to allowing duty-free shopping for Hainan onshore residents 
(without departing Hainan), which we believe could be a pilot program ahead of the tax 
exemption initiative for Hainan by 2025. According to Wind, there are about 9mn local 
residents in Hainan. Assuming an annual luxury/ leisure spending of RMB1,000 that 
CTGDF could capture, we estimate the relaxation, should it realize, would represent a 
RMB9bn addressable market that CTGDF could explore and a 14% expansion to the 
Hainan offshore duty free market. 
 
Domestic consumption repatriation  
The 14th Five-Year Plan promotes a new development pattern that centers on the domestic 
consumption circulation along with the co-development of an international circulation. The 
policy emphasizes the central role of the domestic consumption and seeks to improve the 
efficacy and efficiency of the circulation with the aim of bringing back overseas spending 
to sustain domestic economic growth. According to CTGDF, total overseas duty-free 
spending by China tourists reached approximately RMB1.8tn in 2019, with Korean Duty-
free (KDFS) contributing to RMB1tn, 55% of the total. These compare to only RMB54bn 
domestic duty free spending. Assuming 10% of the spending will be redirected to the 
domestic market; we estimate this could boost the market size of the latter by 33%.

On a separate note, The Tax Free World Association (TFWA) pointed out that around 78% 
of China consumers’ spending were conducted overseas. The organization also pointed 
out that Chinese consumers contributed about 60% of the global duty-free consumption in 
2020, and about 80% of the Korea duty-free consumption of the same year.

In fact, with the relaxation of duty-free policy since July 2020, the total imports of consumer 
goods grew 8.2% YoY to RMB1.6tn, according to the China Custom. Jewelry and 
cosmetics offered the fastest growth of 30%, followed by suitcase of 20%. This translated 
to RMB33bn duty-free spending for Hainan for the same year, despite travel restrictions 
amid the pandemic. Given the ambition of reshaping Hainan to be a tax-free port by 2025, 
domestic duty-free sales will remain a channel to repatriate overseas consumption back to 
China.

Aggressive online strategy 
CTGDF took the initiative to develop its online platform. It takes full advantage of the rise 
of online shopping and creates a consistent customer engagement from the moment a trip 
is planned and the moment the traveler returns home. The international travel restrictions 
since early 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has accidentally accelerated the 
launch of the initiative. Of note, CTGDF has been full engaged in online sales and 
marketing through multiple online channels since February 2020 with new functions that 
are, but not limited to the followings:  
 
Personalized product recommendations  
Personalized product recommendations were made to customers based on their browsing 
and purchase histories. CTGDF also organized livestreaming shows to enable direct 
interaction between customers and KOLs. 
 
Customer services and customer loyalty program  
The Company provided online chats and hotline support to respond to customer enquiries. 
An integrated customer loyalty program based on membership points was also created via 
WeChat app.

Unlocking value from a USD1bn H-share secondary listing 
We believe CTGDF’s upcoming H-share listing (likely within 4Q21) is value accretive to 
shareholders. Operationally, the listing will help cementing CTGDF’s global presence by 
enhancing its war chest for future overseas expansion or acquisitions, as well as smoothing 
out its international procurement activities. The former will include green-field projects in 
port stores overseas, securing concession rights and operate duty-free stores in airports in 
Asia, as well as duty-free counters on cruise ships, of which is regarded as the new growth 
spot for Chinese tourists. Separately, according to CTGDF, there will be a portion of the 
proceeds to be spent on existing channels, including but not limited to: 
1) 
Investment in the duty-free stores in key airports, seaports, railway stations, etc. More 
specifically, the proceeds will be used to (a) develop new stores in key airports, 
especially in relation to their renovation, procurement and operations, and (b) renew 
the concession rights; 
 
2) 
Development of the integrated travel retail complex. Integrated travel retail complex is 
a business model with duty-free retail as their core business and in synergetic 
development with other businesses such as duty-paid retail, dining, entertainment, 
leisure and hotel; 
 
3) 
Expansion for the Haikou International Duty-Free Complex and the Sanya 
International Duty-free Complex. Both are expected to complete in 2022 and 2023..

We believe the expansion of Haikou/ Sanya Duty-free complex is crucial to sustain 
CTGDF’s leadership in Hainan (currently 90%+ market share), especially when we forecast 
Hainan’s total duty-free sales could grow at a 46.2% 5-year CAGR from currently RMB60bn 
by end-2021 to RMB183bn by 2025. Our forecast is in line with Hainan’s official target of 
RMB60bn in 2021 and RMB100bn in 2022, and is slightly more aggressive than IATA’s 
recovery expectation of having global tourist traffic for 2022 and 2023 to reach 88% and 
105% of 2019, respectively.

Potential re-rating from an expanded shareholder base  
We argue the benefits from CTGDF’s secondary listing in HK do not only source from an 
enhanced operational efficiency, but also from an expanded global investor base. CTGDF 
will be the only stock in the H-share market that directly exposes to the fast-growing duty-
free market of China. It possess a recognizable operational scale and an unparalleled 
industry leadership, a crown jewel of the market that deserves a scarcity premium over 
both its international and domestic peers in a sustainable manner.  
Since July 2020, CTGDF used to trade at a 2.0x average premium to its international peers, 
such as Hotel Shilla (008770 KS, NR), Lotte Shopping (023530 KS, NR), Lagardere (MMB  
FP, NR) and Dufry (DUFN SW, NR). Given a higher ROE and faster earnings projection 
(34% 2-year CAGR vs c20% CAGR), CTGDF looks to be undervalued relative to its peers.

Financial analysis 
We project a 42.3% 3-year revenue CAGR for CTGDF during 2020-23E, driven mainly by 
a 51.0% CAGR of duty-free sales, which will be underpinned by the fast-growing Hainan 
offshore duty-free business. Owing to the rapid expansion of the online operations, which 
typically offer lower profitability, as well as more aggressive discount promotions amid the 
pandemic, we estimate gross margins weakness to prevail until 2022E when benefits of a 
better SKU mix and scale of economies emerge. Meanwhile, a lower rental and hence 
better operating leverage could partially neutralize the impact to our net profits estimates. 
We regard further rental concessions from Beijing and Guangzhou airports and Hainan’s 
tax concession as event-driven catalyst to our earnings forecasts. 
 
Hainan offshore and online businesses are major revenue growth drivers 
We expect total revenue growth to offer a 42.3% 3-year CAGR from 2020-2023E, 
mainly driven by the 51.0% CAGR of duty-free sales. Owing to the resurgence of 
COVID cases in May, 2Q21 revenue were flat QoQ. Together with the lingering 
outbreaks in Nanjing by end-July, we believe market expectation on 3Q revenue has 
remained low. That said, this could probably mark the trough of the year, followed by 
a quick recovery heading into the festive 4Q, in our view. Into 2022E, we are hopeful 
to see a pick-up in duty-free revenue from a better tourist traffic to Hainan. Separately, 
there is no sign of a slowdown in CTGDF’s online business thanks to an aggressive 
online strategy, not to mention the gradual yet permanent migration in the shopping 
behaviour for Chinese consumers. For instance, we estimate CTGDF’s Sanya DF and 
Hainan Duty-free (HDFS) to register RMB39.4bn/14.5bn and RMB49.3bn/19.5bn 
revenue for 2021/22E, respectively. (1H21: RMB18.5bn and RMB7.7bn).

 
Margins recovery in sight thanks to better efficiency and SKU mix 
Profit margins across business segments (i.e. ports, airports and offshore operations, 
etc.) vary due to product mix and mark-up. Of note, cosmetic and beauty products 
typically offer higher margins than luxuries and apparels. The same dynamic also 
applies to CTGDF’s online platform, which commands a lower margin than offline 
sales due to more intensified competition and difference in SKUs.  
Since 2020, a higher contribution from electronic platforms (website, WeChat) and 
discount offered to members were the major reasons for gross margins to soften. That 
said, we are optimistic that over time scale of economies from a centralized 
procurement would gradually mitigate the trend. Separately, CTGDF also mentioned 
since the policy relaxation in July 2020, they have seen a noticeable pickup in demand 
for high price-tag products. There is also an increasing number of brand owners who 
are becoming more aggressive to offer discount promotions. In our view, this should 
be positive to CTGDF. We only expect a more meaningful pick-up beyond 2022E 
when travel restrictions are more likely to be withdrawn.

 
Rental revision a relief to margins; provision reversal an upside to earnings 
The revision on the rental negotiations with Shanghai Pudong airport was favorable to 
CTGDF. Instead of charging a monthly rental guarantee, the new term is based on 
variable factors such as international and total passenger volume as well as rental 
area, if international traffic falls below 80% of the average monthly level of 2019. 
Separately, the monthly rental guarantee would only be required only when 
international passenger traffic rises beyond 80% of the average monthly level of 2019. 
On the financial statements, the new agreement has achieved a 70% rental fee 
savings for 2020. Considering also a swift migration to e-commerce platforms, we 
believe CTGDF will see a structural reduction on its rental expenses under SG&A.

CTGDF has not finalized its discussions with Beijing and Guangzhou Airport. But since 
rental terms of both were based on passenger traffic of the airports, we incline to believe 
CTGDF would also be able to enjoy similar concessions when the number of international 
travelers remains unexciting. We estimate CTGDF had already provided for the rental 
expenses for Beijing and Guangzhou airports for 2020 and 1H21. In this case, any future 
rental concessions should prompt relevant reversals and hence profit accretive. 
 
Hainan’s 15% tax concession could boost 8% of 2021/22E consolidated NPs 
CTGDF recognized a 25% effective tax rate for 2018-20, as the Company is yet to be 
entitled to the 15% tax concession under Hainan's Free Trade Port (FTP) scheme. We 
have no visibility on when CTGDF could monetize the opportunity, however, we are certain 
that the recognition could not only lead to a partial reversal of a RMB2.57bn tax provision 
for 2020, but also 13% increase in post-tax profits for CTGDF’s Hainan operations upon 
implementation. In our sensitivity analysis, the change could lead to c8% upside in our 
2021/22E net profits estimate on group level.

Valuation  
We initiate at Buy with a target price of RMB350.0 
We initiate CTGDF at Buy. Our target price of RMB350.0 is based on 43.0x end-22E P/E, 
which represents +1sd above average of the last 3 years. CTGDF was significantly re-rated 
since July 2020, when a set of policy relaxations on duty-free spending cap was announced. 
As such, our target multiple is also approximately benchmarked to the long-term average 
valuation starting from July 2020 of 44.0x. Our methodology explains our near-term 
expectation for CTGDF’s share price to mean-revert as if domestic travel and spending 
were to recover approaching a more festive 4Q, and even to a better 2022E with 
undisrupted domestic tourist traffic.

Investment risk 
Changes in the existing duty-free policies and regulations – CTGDF’s duty-free retail 
business in China is generally subject to the government policies and regulations, and any 
changes in these policies or regulations would significantly impact the duty-free purchase 
volume, and thus materially impact CTGDF. In particular, the downtown duty-free policies 
will likely be further refined and the further development of downtown duty-free stores, 
especially those by CTGDF’s competitors, may increase the competition. 
Renewed outbreak of domestic COVID variants – that directly attributable to further 
travel bans and hence visitation to Hainan. 
Competition from online shopping platforms – online retailers, for instance the Daigou 
service provider, are able to sell directly to consumers, diminishing the importance of 
traditional distribution channels. Internet retailers may have significantly lower operating 
costs than CTGDF does, as they do not rely on an expensive physical retail network or a 
large sales force. Their products could look more price competitive than CTGDF’s. 
Risk with brand owners – renewal of contracts with brands is subject to the mutual 
consent and CTGDF may lose the cooperation due to various reason such as brand owners’ 
ongoing struggle on balancing the interest between onshore and duty-free sales. 
Resumption of global travelling activities – this may indirectly channel domestic duty-
free spending to overseas.

With over 35 years of experience, CTGDF has become the largest travel retail operator 
worldwide offering high quality duty-free and duty-paid merchandise to travelers. CTGDF’s 
worldwide ranking by retail sales value has gradually improved over the last decade, from 
the 19th in 2010 to the 12th in 2015, and further enhanced to the fourth in 2019 before 
hitting the top in 2020, representing a 22.6% of market share of the global travel retail 
industry in 2020, according to Frost & Sullivan. 
To develop China’s travel retail business, CTGDF focuses on duty-free, its core strength, 
while pursuing international expansion. Having the most duty-free stores in China, the 
Company is the dominant retail operator in China covering all duty-free sales channels, 
including port stores, offshore stores, downtown stores, cruise stores, inflight stores as well 
as ship-supply stores.  
Acknowledging the importance of streamlining its business, CTGDF acquired Sunrise 
China, Sunrise Shanghai and Hainan DF in 2017, 2018 and 2020. In 2019, the Company 
transferred its entire equity interest in CITS Agency to CTG while continuing to focus on 
the duty-free retail industry. In response to its business and strategy, the Company was 
renamed as China Tourism Group Duty Free Corporation Limited in June 2020. As of 31 
Dec 2020, CTGDF’s registered capital was RMB1,952,475,544, comprising 1,952,475,544 
A Shares, of which approximately 53.30% was held by CTGDF’s controlling shareholder, 
CTG.

As a key market player, CTGDF refined duty-free policies in China and brought innovations 
in duty-free business models, which allowed the Company to enjoy the first-mover 
advantage. Given the expectation of favorable offshore duty-free policies, in 2011, the 
Company operated an offshore duty-free store in downtown Sanya, namely the first in 
China. To take a step further, in 2014, CTGDF opened the Sanya International Duty-Free 
Complex, China’s first integrated travel retail complex, which has been recognized as a 
landmark of Hainan and established the integrated travel retail complex business model for 
the industry. Being the largest standalone integrated travel retail complex in the world by 
sales area (over 70,000 sq m), other than duty-free business, the complex also supports 
other businesses such as duty-paid retail, dining, entertainment and leisure to offer a one-
stop shopping and leisure experience.

Port duty-free stores 
CTGDF has a broad network of port duty-free stores covering airports, border crossings 
and other areas such as railway stations, cross-border bus stations and seaports. With 
airport channel being the largest part of its port duty-free business, CTGDF’s stores can be 
found in both departure and arrival areas in airports, and are usually located in central 
areas with strong traffic. Thanks to its wholly-owned subsidiary CDFG and majority-owned 
subsidiaries Sunrise China and Sunrise Shanghai, CTGDF has concession rights to run 
duty-free stores in key aviation hubs in China and the Asia-Pacific Region, including nine 
of the top ten airports in China, including Beijing Capital International Airport, Shanghai 
Pudong International Airport and Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport, the top three 
airports in terms of international passenger traffic in 2020, as well as the Hong Kong 
International Airport and the Macau International Airport.  
In addition, CTGDF secured the concession rights in 2019 to sell duty-free perfume, 
cosmetics, food, tobacco and liquor products at Beijing Daxing International Airport for a 
term of 10 years. Looking ahead, the passenger traffic of Daxing Airport is expected to 
grow and the Company’s influence over the duty-free channels of the major ports would be 
further enhanced. 
According to Frost & Sullivan, CTGDF’s duty-free stores offer the most comprehensive 
coverage in border crossings across China. It had duty-free stores at 46 land border-
crossings, 20 duty-free stores in other locations including railway stations, cross-border bus 
stations and seaports, as of 31 Dec 2020.

Offshore duty-free stores 
Following the favorable tax policy for tourists leaving Hainan to enjoy duty-free shopping, 
Hainan’s core duty-free sale channels have been captured by CTGDF through the 
establishment of offshore duty-free stores throughout the island. In 2014, its Sanya 
International Duty-Free Complex, the first integrated travel retail complex in China, and the 
largest single duty-free store in the world in terms of total sales area according to Frost & 
Sullivan, commenced business with more than 70,000 sq m of sales area. CTGDF also 
operates duty-free stores with easy access in downtown Haikou and the area of Boao 
Forum for Asia. To stay in line with its marketing and promotion strategy, it has set up 
experience centers designed for different locations such as resorts, scenic spots, and 
outlets in Hainan to let travelers experience the products in person while offering the pick-
up service when they depart Hainan. Together with two major airports in Hainan, it has 
successfully set up a well-rounded duty-free retail network.  
CTGDF’s offshore duty-free stores offer Chinese tourists who usually visit overseas duty-
free stores another option. In 2020, in view of the favorable government policies and 
COVID-19 pandemic which caused significant decrease in international travel activities, its 
sales from offshore duty-free stores recorded a strong improvement. In 2018, 2019 and 
2020, the revenue generated from offshore duty-free stores were RMB8,010.4mn, 
RMB13,249.6mn and RMB29,961.9mn, with a CAGR of 93.4%.

In response to the “duty-free shopping plus premium hotel” project, expansion of Sanya

construction since March 2021 and is foreseen to be completed in 2023 with an estimated 
GFA of 76,500 sq m. For hotel area, its construction is targeted to start in Dec 2021 and to 
commence operations in 2026 with an estimated GFA of 96,000 sq m.

Downtown duty-free stores 
Apart from four overseas downtown duty-free stores, five downtown duty-free stores 
are operated in Beijing, Shanghai, Xiamen, Qingdao and Dalian respectively to target 
foreign nationals and Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan residents. Customers are 
requested to show their travel documents when ordering and making payments. They 
can only collect the purchased goods in the pick-up areas of airports or other facilities 
where CTGDF operates. In other words, to purchase duty-free products at CTGDF’s 
downtown duty-free stores, customers need to have a definite plan to travel abroad. 
 
4. 
Others 
CTGDF also operates duty-free stores onboard cruise liners and airplanes that are en route 
to destinations abroad.  While operating in-flight duty stores with major airlines in China, 
CTGDF signed a cooperation agreement with one of the world’s largest cruise companies 
in 2018 to step into the international cruise market, securing the concession rights to 
operate duty-free stores on their cruises.  
In addition, ship-supply services are available for outbound ships, and duty-paid stores are 
available in the domestic departure and arrival areas of several airports and railway stations.
