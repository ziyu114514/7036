Despite the fact that industry demand for excavator was weak and steel cost was 
high in 2Q21, Hengli’s net profit in 2Q21 only dropped 2% YoY to RMB626mn 
which is slightly better than expectation. Net profit in 1H21 grew 43% YoY to 
RMB1.41bn, which accounted for 48% of our full year estimates (run rate in 1H20: 
43%). It’s worth noting that the revenue from pump, valve and other products 
exceeded that of the excavator hydraulic cylinder in 1H21, a key driver for the 
resilient results. We expect Hengli’s production volume of hydraulic cylinders in 
Aug to see >10% YoY growth, and expect an acceleration in 4Q21E on the back 
of better infrastructure spending growth. That said, we maintain our HOLD rating 
as we believe the stock is fairly-priced at 43x 2021E P/E. We maintain our TP of 
RMB103 (based on unchanged 46x 2021E P/E).       
 Key financials in 1H21. Revenue in 1H21 grew 51% YoY to RMB5,2bn. 
Gross margin held up well at 41% (down only 0.9ppt YoY). Operating cash 
inflow grew 25% YoY to RMB1.19bn, which is healthy in our view. In 2Q21, 
Hengli managed to deliver 14% YoY revenue growth while gross margin 
remained stable at 41% QoQ despite the high steel cost.  
 Hydraulic cylinder better than our expectation. Sales volume of hydraulic 
cylinder (for excavator) grew 44% YoY to 474k units in 1H21. The sales 
volume growth outpaced the excavator industry sales volume growth of 38%. 
ASP slightly dropped 4% YoY to RMB4,177 / unit. Sales volume of non-
standardized cylinders grew 23% YoY to 78.8k units in 1H21 and ASP 
increased 19% YoY to RMB10.7k/unit due to product mix improvement in our 
view.  
 Explosive growth of pump, valve and motor continued. Revenue from 
Hengli Hydraulic Technology (major products include pump, valve and motor) 
surged 78% YoY to RMB2.1bn in 1H21, which exceeded the revenue from 
excavator hydraulic cylinder (RMB1.98bn).  
 Upside risks: (1) Strong market share gain; (2) better-than-expected 
excavator 
demand. 
Downside 
risks: (1) 
Continuous 
slowdown 
of 
construction activities; (2) risk of overseas expansion.
