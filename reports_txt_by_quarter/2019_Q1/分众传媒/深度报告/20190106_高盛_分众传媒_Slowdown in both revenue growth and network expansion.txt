We revisit the competition dynamics and macro headwinds faced by 
Focus Media. We think the cyclical impact on advertisement might 
be more serious than expected and revenue growth might further 
slow down to the low teens level after 4Q18, in line with that 
observed during 2013-15. Meanwhile, the slowing down of Focus 
Media’s network expansion, as well as the new round of ﬁnancing 
that its rival Xinchao Media has secured from Baidu and others, 
might lead to a longer-than-expected price war. Hence, we cut our 
2018E-21E EPS by 1.6%-20% to reﬂect lower revenue as well as 
lower margins. We expect 2019E NI to decline by 8% yoy to 
Rmb5.58bn due to lower ASP and higher cost per screen. According 
to our estimates, 4Q18 and 1Q19 should be the growth rate trough. 
We cut our 12-month target price to Rmb7.89 (was Rmb11.67), but 
maintain Buy on attractive valuation (the stock is trading at 14x 
2019E P/E vs. an average of 20x for global outdoor advertising 
peers, and 18x average for domestic media peers). 
Macro headwinds intensify 
Macro headwinds have begun to impact advertising expenditure. 
According to CTR, China advertisement expenditure on traditional 
media (ex-internet media) was down 2.8% in October, declining 
further from a 1.5% yoy fall in 3Q18, after a 9.3% yoy rise in 1H18. 
Thanks to the Singles Day advertising campaign of Alibaba and other 
e-commerce platforms, Elevator LCD screen ads and Elevator 
Poster ads maintained relatively stable growth, increasing 
23.9%/23.6% yoy in Oct, respectively, vs. 26%/25% in Sept. 
However, we think the impact from macro headwinds might further 
expand to inner building advertisement expenditure, and notably 
brand advertising at the low end is the ad basket most likely to be 
cut, in our view due to the limited targeting ability of inner building

ad formats. During the investor meeting at the GS China Conference held on Nov 16, 
management also expressed concerns about the impact from the economic slowdown, 
and expected revenue growth in 4Q18 to further slow down to the mid-teen level. 
Currently, the biggest contribution of advertisement revenue is from FMCG products, 
which grew 57% yoy in 1H18 and contributed 24% of total ad revenue for Focus Media. 
Excluding FMCG, other sectors grew at 16% yoy in 1H18. Given that FMCG usually has 
6-9 months time lag in the advertisement cycle vs. macroeconomic growth, we think 
2019 growth might see a drag from a deceleration in FMCG advertising. Furthermore, 
internet advertising might continue its single-digit growth in inner building media given 
that trafﬁc advertising growth of internet companies is becoming more muted as it 
enters a matured stage of penetration.

Competition remains a concern but screen roll out might slow down 
With Xinchao Media, the aggressive competitor shaking Focus Media’s dominant 
position in the industry, securing another round of ﬁnancing of Rmb2.1bn (led by Baidu), 
competition remains a pressure for Focus Media. Although the CEO of Xinchao recently 
said that the company would slow the pace of its network expansion after reaching 
coverage of 700k elevators because of the macroeconomic uncertainties, competition 
alarm is still not disarmed from Focus Media’s perspective. According to the CEO of 
Xinchao (as per media report dated December 10 from wallstreetcn.com), the company 
will realize revenue of Rmb1bn in 2018 (which is far less than its April 2018 announced 
target of Rmb1.5bn), but is still running at a loss and would like to monetize the 
operation of the current network. We see this as a signal of alleviation of the elevator 
resources war. Meanwhile, Focus Media also sent out similar signals. During the 
investor meeting at the November GS China Conference, Focus Media management 
indicated that terminal expansion in 2019 might slow down and trend at the low end of 
its latest 500k-1mn increase target if competition pressure eases up, and the company 
might focus more on the monetization of new screens. We think the trimming of the 
screen roll-out plan for 2019 is due to several factors: 1) the macro headwinds bring less 
visibility of ad expenditure for 2019, 2) the slow down of competitors’ network 
expansion, and 3) Focus Media will have developed 1.1-1.2mn new screens as of end 
2018, much more than the previous target of 1mn set in April, and the company has 
secured most incremental prime locations in 2018. There is no need to further expand 
aggressively in 2019, in our view. 
On the other hand, as of end 2018 the combined penetration rate of Focus Media 
(1.1mn coverage of elevators, according to our estimate) and Xinchao Media (700k 
elevators, according to the company) would be close to 30% of total elevators in China. 
Including the other smaller players in lower tier cities, the penetration of elevators with 
advertising media would be even higher than 50%. Therefore, we think the network 
expansion of Focus Media and Xinchao Media would be more determined by the growth 
rate of elevators in China, which we estimate at 10%-12% in the next couple of years. 
Given the macroeconomic slowdown and reduced competition, we now expect the total 
number of ad terminals in elevators to reach 2.95mn/3.42mn in 2019/20 (down from 
3.71mn/4.92mn for 2019/20 previously), implying 14% and 16% growth, in line with the 
average growth rate between 2014-17. Still, we expect the ASP (average revenue per 
terminal) growth to continue to decline by 2%-3% during 2019-20 as demand growth 
might still lag that of supply growth and competition will continue to weight on pricing 
power. 
While this supply slowdown could ease the cost pressures, we think the intense price 
competition between Focus Media and Xinchao Media might last longer than expected, 
with less likelihood that Xinchao is squeezed out of the market given that Baidu, the 
largest online ad company in China, is now a strategic investor, and as Focus Media has 
decided to slow its network expansion. With its much smaller size (Xinchao’s 2018 
revenue will likely be only about 6%-7% of Focus Media’s), we think Xinchao Media will 
continue to lose money for a while until it proactively stops its price war and focuses 
more on proﬁtability and monetization. Chances of a co-existing dual oligarchic market

structure in the long run are increasing, in our view, and if that happens we expect 
Focus Media’s proﬁtability to stabilize in the next 2-3 years. 
 
Estimate and valuation 
We cut our 2018E-2021E revenue for Focus Media by 1.3%-13.7% mainly to reﬂect 
lower advertising spend on the back of macroeconomic uncertainties. We now expect 
21%/10%/13%/15% revenue growth in 2018E-21E. For the inner building media 
business (the largest business, contributing 80% of total revenue), we expect revenue 
growth to slow down to the mid-teen level in 4Q18 and then signiﬁcantly slow further to 
10% yoy in 2019, similar to what happened during 2013-14 when China GDP growth also 
faced strong headwinds. After 2019, we expect growth to recover moderately to 14% 
and 15% on the back of the economy stabilizing and monetization of the new screen 
format—the vertical screen customized for LBS (Location-based) local advertisers. 
We think COGS will continue to grow rapidly (at 35% yoy in 2019 and 20% in 2020), 
largely due to the rising rental per terminal due to higher competition, as well as 
increased supply. 
We also cut 2018E-21E EPS by 1.6%-20% to reﬂect lower revenue as well as lower 
margins. We think COGS will continue to outgrow revenue in the next two years, due to 
increasing rental cost per screen, lower ad upload and lower ASP. We expect overall GP 
margin to continue to go down from 65% in 2018E to 58% in 2019 until it stabilizes at 
55% in 2020. We expect EBIT margin to decline from 42% in 2018E to 34% in 2020E, 
and stabilize at 34% in 2021E due to alleviated competition and slower screen roll out. 
We expect NI to decline by 8% yoy in 2019E to Rmb5.58bn due to lower ASP and higher 
cost per screen.

Due to high base in 2H17 and 1H18, we think NI growth will turn negative in 4Q18 
(-41% yoy) and 1H19 (-22% yoy) before stabilizing in 2H19.  We expect 4Q18 and 1Q19 
will be the trough of the NI growth rate.

Following the cut to our estimates, we lower our 12-m TP  to Rmb7.89 (was Rmb11.67). 
Our TP methodology is still based on P/E, but we roll back the target year from 2021 to 
2020, to better reﬂect near-term growth momentum, and we now apply a multiple of 
20x (was 23x) as we benchmark to global peers’ current 12m forward P/E levels. We 
continue to discount back to 2019 using 8% COE. We maintain a Buy rating on 
unchanged long-term competitive advantages and a dominant position, as well attractive 
valuation. 
Key risks 
Economic slowdown could impact overall ad expenditure: Focus Media’s ad revenue is 
highly correlated with advertising market growth, which is largely driven by economic 
growth. If economic growth further slows, advertisers tend to cut their ad budgets, thus 
hurting Focus Media’s revenue growth. 
Competition gets tougher: If Xinchao Media adopts a more aggressive expansion 
strategy and launch another round of price war on advertisement and elevator rental, 
Focus Media might have to ﬁght back ﬁercely by reaccelerating network expansion or 
via a price war, which would further weigh on margins. 
Sell-off of unlocked shares: On 31 December 2018, 53% of the company’s shares will 
be unlocked, including 23% from the founder of Focus Media and 30% from a group of 
domestic PE funds that had bought Focus Media’s shares before the company’s 
backdoor listing. If these potential unlocked shares were sold off, it might pose material 
pressure on the share price.

Disclosure Appendix 
 
 
Reg AC 
I, Xufa Liao, CFA, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately reﬂect my personal views about the subject company or 
companies and its or their securities. I also certify that no part of my compensation was, is or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the speciﬁc 
recommendations or views expressed in this report. 
GS Factor Proﬁle 
The Goldman Sachs Factor Proﬁle provides investment context for a stock by comparing key attributes to the market (i.e. our coverage universe) and its 
sector peers. The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial 
Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for speciﬁc metrics for each stock. The 
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may 
vary depending on the ﬁscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows: 
Growth is based on a stock’s forward-looking sales growth, EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for ﬁnancial stocks, only EPS and sales growth), with a 
higher percentile indicating a higher growth company. Financial Returns is based on a stock’s forward-looking ROE, ROCE and CROCI (for ﬁnancial 
stocks, only ROE), with a higher percentile indicating a company with higher ﬁnancial returns. Multiple is based on a stock’s forward-looking P/E, P/B, 
price/dividend (P/D), EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF and EV/Debt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for ﬁnancial stocks, only P/E, P/B and P/D), with a higher percentile 
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple. The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile, Financial Returns 
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile). 
Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the ﬁscal year-end at least three quarters in the future. Growth uses inputs 
for the ﬁscal year at least seven quarters in the future compared with the year at least three quarters in the future (on a per-share basis for all metrics). 
For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Proﬁle, please contact your GS representative.  
M&A Rank 
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary 
across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring 
companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 
representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard 
departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not 
factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research. 
Quantum 
Quantum is Goldman Sachs’ proprietary database providing access to detailed ﬁnancial statement histories, forecasts and ratios. It can be used for 
in-depth analysis of a single company, or to make comparisons between companies in different sectors and markets.  
GS SUSTAIN 
GS SUSTAIN is a global investment strategy focused on the generation of long-term alpha through identifying high quality industry leaders. The GS 
SUSTAIN 50 list includes leaders we believe to be well positioned to deliver long-term outperformance through superior returns on capital, sustainable 
competitive advantage and effective management of ESG risks vs. global industry peers. Candidates are selected largely on a combination of 
quantiﬁable analysis of these three aspects of corporate performance.

Ratings, coverage groups and views and related deﬁnitions 
Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) -Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or 
Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an 
Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a  stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. 
Each regional Investment Review Committee manages various regional Investment Lists to a global guideline of 25%-35% of stocks as Buy and 
10%-15% of stocks as Sell; however, the distribution of Buys and Sells in any particular analyst’s coverage group may vary as determined by the 
regional Investment Review Committee. Additionally, each Investment Review Committee manages Regional Conviction lists, which represent 
investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their 
respective areas of coverage.  The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction lists do not represent a change in the analysts’ investment rating 
for such stocks.    
Total return potential represents the upside or downside differential between the current share price and the price target, including all paid or 
anticipated dividends, expected during the time horizon associated with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The total 
return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership.  
Coverage groups and views: A list of all stocks in each coverage group is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage group at 
http://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html. The analyst assigns one of the following coverage views which represents the analyst’s investment outlook 
on the coverage group relative to the group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  Attractive (A). The investment outlook over the following 12 
months is favorable relative to the coverage group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  Neutral (N). The investment outlook over the following 
12 months is neutral relative to the coverage group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  Cautious (C). The investment outlook over the following 
12 months is unfavorable relative to the coverage group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.   
Not Rated (NR). The investment rating and target price have been removed pursuant to Goldman Sachs policy when Goldman Sachs is acting in an 
advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving this company and in certain other circumstances.  Rating Suspended (RS). Goldman 
Sachs Research has suspended the investment rating and price target for this stock, because there is not a sufﬁcient fundamental basis for 
determining, or there are legal, regulatory or policy constraints around publishing, an investment rating or target. The previous investment rating and 
price target, if any, are no longer in effect for this stock and should not be relied upon.  Coverage Suspended (CS). Goldman Sachs has suspended 
coverage of this company.  Not Covered (NC). Goldman Sachs does not cover this company.  Not Available or Not Applicable (NA). The information 
is not available for display or is not applicable.  Not Meaningful (NM). The information is not meaningful and is therefore excluded.

The analysts named in this report may have from time to time discussed with our clients, including Goldman Sachs salespersons and traders, or may 
discuss in this report, trading strategies that reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term impact on the market price of the equity securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analyst’s published price target expectations for such stocks. Any such 
trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analyst’s fundamental equity rating for such stocks, which rating reﬂects a stock’s return 
potential relative to its coverage group as described herein. 
We and our afﬁliates, ofﬁcers, directors, and employees, excluding equity and credit analysts, will from time to time have long or short positions in, act 
as principal in, and buy or sell, the securities or derivatives, if any, referred to in this research.  
The views attributed to third party presenters at Goldman Sachs arranged conferences, including individuals from other parts of Goldman Sachs, do not 
necessarily reﬂect those of Global Investment Research and are not an ofﬁcial view of Goldman Sachs. 
Any third party referenced herein, including any salespeople, traders and other professionals or members of their household, may have positions in the 
products mentioned that are inconsistent with the views expressed by analysts named in this report. 
This research is not an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any security in any jurisdiction where such an offer or solicitation would be 
illegal. It does not constitute a personal recommendation or take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of 
individual clients. Clients should consider whether any advice or recommendation in this research is suitable for their particular circumstances and, if 
appropriate, seek professional advice, including tax advice. The price and value of investments referred to in this research and the income from them 
may ﬂuctuate. Past performance is not a guide to future performance, future returns are not guaranteed, and a loss of original capital may occur. 
Fluctuations in exchange rates could have adverse effects on the value or price of, or income derived from, certain investments.  
Certain transactions, including those involving futures, options, and other derivatives, give rise to substantial risk and are not suitable for all investors. 
Investors should review current options disclosure documents which are available from Goldman Sachs sales representatives or at 
http://www.theocc.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. Transaction costs may be signiﬁcant in option strategies calling for multiple purchase and 
sales of options such as spreads. Supporting documentation will be supplied upon request.  
Differing Levels of Service provided by Global Investment Research: The level and types of services provided to you by the Global Investment 
Research division of GS may vary as compared to that provided to internal and other external clients of GS, depending on various factors including your 
individual preferences as to the frequency and manner of receiving communication, your risk proﬁle and investment focus and perspective (e.g., 
marketwide, sector speciﬁc, long term, short term), the size and scope of your overall client relationship with GS, and legal and regulatory constraints.  
As an example, certain clients may request to receive notiﬁcations when research on speciﬁc securities is published, and certain clients may request 
that speciﬁc data underlying analysts’ fundamental analysis available on our internal client websites be delivered to them electronically through data 
feeds or otherwise. No change to an analyst’s fundamental research views (e.g., ratings, price targets, or material changes to earnings estimates for 
equity securities), will be communicated to any client prior to inclusion of such information in a research report broadly disseminated through electronic 
publication to our internal client websites or through other means, as necessary, to all clients who are entitled to receive such reports. 
All research reports are disseminated and available to all clients simultaneously through electronic publication to our internal client websites. Not all
