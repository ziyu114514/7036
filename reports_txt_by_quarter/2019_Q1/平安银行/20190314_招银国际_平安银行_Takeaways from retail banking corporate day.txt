Takeaways from retail banking corporate day 
 
 We attended Ping An Bank’s (PAB) retail banking corporate day in Shenzhen 
last week. We see tremendous growth potential for the Bank’s retail business, 
as it benefits from Ping An Group’s all-rounded supports and successful 
migration of client base.  
 In the second stage of retail transformation. PAB officially kicked off its 
retail transformation in 2H16, with the foremost target of growing retail client 
base (40.5 mn in FY16) and lifting retail revenue contribution (30.6% in FY16). 
By end-FY18, no. of client and proportion of revenue from retail segment 
reached 83.9 mn and 53%, respectively. Since 4Q18, PAB has entered the 
second stage of retail transformation (Figure 1), with key objective of 
enhancing earnings ability. A major initiative is to boost private banking and 
wealth management businesses.  
 The core “3+2+1” framework. PAB’s retail business is underpinned by a 
unique framework (Figure 2), which comprises: three modules - basic retail, 
consumer finance & private banking (PB); two competencies - cost & risk 
management; and one internal driver - Artificial Intelligence (AI). Basic retail 
mainly supports customer acquisition and volume growth, while consumer 
finance and PB are major profit and AUM generators.   
 Comparison with “Industry benchmark”. CMB (600036 CH, NR) is broadly 
recognized as the best retail bank in China. As such, we compare PAB to CMB on 
multiple fronts of retail business, including 1) revenue & profit mix; 2) 
structure & pricing of loans & deposits; 3) NPL ratio; 4) client amount & AUM 
per capita, and 5) cost-income ratio. We found that PAB is comparable to CMB 
in retail profit and loan contribution, but inferior in operating efficiency, asset 
quality and profitability. 
 4Q18 results highlights. A bright spot was 13bps QoQ NIM expansion, which 
drove a 15.8% YoY revenue growth in 4Q18. Despite the 41% YoY surge in 
impairment charges, net profit still saw a decent growth of 7.0% YoY, beating 
most joint-stock peers. It was also encouraging to see a notable increase in the 
Bank’s NPL/90-day overdue ratio (up 22ppts QoQ to 103%), which has been a 
valuation overhang in past years. Stricter NPL recognition will ease regulatory 
risks and further unleash PAB’s earnings momentum ahead. A major weakness 
was the Bank’s thin capital buffer, as CET-1 CAR only stood at 8.54% (vs 7.5% 
threshold) in 4Q18.  
 Valuation. PAB currently trades at 0.85x FY19E P/B, vs 0.87x for A-share bank 
average and 1.34x for CMB-A. There is foreseeable valuation upside, should the 
Bank’s retail strategy leads to improving financial performance in coming years. 
PAB is also a key beneficiary of further RRR cuts.
