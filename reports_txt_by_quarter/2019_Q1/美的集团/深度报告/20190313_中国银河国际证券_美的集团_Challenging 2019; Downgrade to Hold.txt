Midea 
Challenging 2019; Downgrade to Hold  
■ Midea’s shares have re-rated on foreign buying, news flow on a possible consumption 
stimulus, and Midea’s share buyback announcement. We think the rally presents an 
opportunity to take profit, and we downgrade to Hold. 
■ Lackluster January sales data supports our cautious 2019 outlook. 
■ High inventory levels in the AC category remain a concern for 2019. 
■ A stimulus could lift appliance demand by RMB700bn, but details remain scarce. 
■ We value Midea at 13x 2020 PER and upgrade our target price from RMB42 to 
RMB46 under our base case scenario. 
Foreign buying and policy expectations drive share price 
Following our target price cut after Midea’s 3Q18 results, consensus EPS numbers have 
continued to drift down. Midea’s share price, however, has rebounded and is up ~31% 
YTD. We believe the rally is grounded in EM inflows, expectations of a consumption 
stimulus, and Midea’s recent announcement of a share buyback. We think the underlying 
fundamentals are largely unchanged from 3Q18. A cap imposed on foreign buying and 
the recent price rally provide an opportunity for profit taking. 
Limited pick-up in home appliance sales in January  
Following Midea’s weak 3Q18, CMM data show a limited turnaround in appliance sales in 
4Q18 and Jan/Feb. We expect lackluster 1Q19 results, particularly in ACs due to the high 
base effect and channel inventory overhang. We are more upbeat about potential 
strengthening in WM, small appliances, and refrigerators over last year’s easier comps.  
Concern about AC channel inventory 
ACs comprise ~40% of Midea’s sales. While Midea’s AC inventory levels remain healthy, 
total channel inventory for the sector may be approaching levels last seen in 2014 prior to 
the previous market downturn in ACs. Considering high channel AC inventory, Midea’s 
flat ASP growth in 3Q18 and a high base effect in 1H19, we think 2019 prospects look 
weak. 
Stimulus could lift appliance demand by RMB700bn in 2019–21 
Comments by Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of NDRC, suggest that a new policy may be 
unrolled to boost appliance consumption in China. News reports suggest the NDRC may 
be estimating a RMB700bn impact on appliance demand in 2019–2021. We construct a 
scenario where consumption stimulus benefits Midea’s top line by ~RMB20bn annually, 
beginning in 2H19. 
Target price updated to RMB46; downgrade to Hold   
We roll our estimates forward to 2020, adjusting Midea’s share base to account for the 
Little Swan acquisition and upcoming share buyback. Our TP increases from RMB42 to 
RMB46 on account of these changes. Our valuation methodology remains unchanged, at 
13x prospective PER. In the near term, a cap on foreign investment may lead to a 
temporary halt in Midea’s re-rating. In a scenario where new consumption policy rolls out 
nationally, increasing appliance sales by ~RMB700bn in 2019–2021, we think Midea is 
potentially worth RMB50 per share, or ~5% more than current price level. Our stimulus 
scenario valuation is based on 13x 2020 PER. We continue to like Midea because of its 
long-term product upgrade story and exposure to international markets, but feel that the
recent market rally has run ahead of slowing fundamentals.

Valuation 
For our base case scenario and current target price, we omit revenue growth 
driven by a stimulus. In our base case scenario, we value Midea at RMB46 per 
share, or a ~3.3% discount from Midea’s current share price. The increase in our 
target price from RMB42 to RMB46 is driven by rolling our EPS estimate forward 
to 2020 and adjusting Midea’s share base for anticipated buybacks and the Little 
Swan acquisition. Our base case target price is based on a 13x 2020 PER. We 
believe that a ceiling on foreign ownership may prevent a positive re-rating from 
continuing, and prefer to benchmark Midea’s P/E in line with the recent market 
valuation. Our forecast EPS is -5% and -10% below 2019/2020 consensus, 
respectively. 
 
Downgrade to Hold 
We think the recent re-rating on Midea’s valuation and cap on foreign ownership 
presents an opportunity to take profit on Midea. We continue to like Midea for its 
long-term product upgrade potential, KUKA’s expansion in China, and export 
potential, but we think that Midea’s current re-rating is detached from business 
fundamentals. Therefore, we downgrade Midea to HOLD. Risks to our 
downgrade include a hot summer, improving sentiment on China’s real estate 
market, and an earlier-than-expected announcement on a consumer stimulus.

NOTE: * MIDEA AND GREE ESTIAMTES FROM CGIS FORECAST 
 
The lack of clarity on the scale and timing of the consumer stimulus means we 
would not incorporate the effect of the stimulus into our forecast. The likely 
impact of a stimulus scenario would be a 1% and 7% increase in our 2019 and 
2020 EPS estimates respectively.

Midea│March 8, 2019 
Share price rally detached from fundamentals  
According to the WSJ, investors have shifted ~US$86bn into emerging market 
equities and bonds year to date. This figure is greater than the last 9 months of 
2018 combined. Foreign buying has helped drive a rally in the MSCI Emerging 
Markets Index, which is up 13% from 2018’s lows. 
 
Since the beginning of 2019, monthly net inflows via the Stock Connect have 
averaged RMB60bn per month. Midea has been a significant beneficiary of this 
inflow, with northbound investor ownership increasing from 13.5% to 16% since 
the beginning of 2019. The 16% ownership disclosed by HKEX excludes foreign 
investors with QFII allocation, so foreign investment in Midea is in reality higher 
than 16%. 
 
Foreign inflows, Midea’s recent share buyback announcement, and expectations 
of a consumption stimulus in 2019 have driven a recent re-rating of Midea, which 
currently trades at ~14x consensus 2019 PER. However, as at March 7, 2019, 
foreign holding in Midea is approaching the 28% ceiling. This means that foreign 
investment will no longer continue to drive demand for Midea’s shares, at least 
in the near term. Furthermore, some index providers may be required to reduce 
Midea’s weighting in major indices. The change may not be permanent, but 
could lead to a temporary halt in Midea’s recent re-rating. We view this as an 
opportunity to take profit.

Midea│March 8, 2019 
Appliances sales growth in Jan–Feb 2019 remained 
lackluster  
Midea’s share price is up ~31% YTD, but current business fundamentals 
continue to show limited growth. After posting ~28% AC growth and ~7% 
consumer appliance growth in 1H18, Midea’s aggregate top line grew only 1.4% 
in 3Q18. KUKA’s top line expanded 6.6% in 3Q18, indicating the slowdown was 
appliance related. 
 
According to CMM, retail sales growth for appliances remained slow in 4Q18 
and in early 2019 (February data currently available only for online sales). This 
data leads us to believe that its 1Q19 results are unlikely to post a turnaround. 
CMM data is based on online data from major Chinese platforms, as well as a 
representative set of 10,000 stores across China.

Midea’s AC inventory well-controlled, but channel 
inventory a concern 
AC channel inventory approaching a historical high 
Midea estimates its own total inventory is well-controlled at ~5–6m units, in line 
with its 3Q18 figure. However, news sources indicate that total channel inventory 
levels (including all AC brands) is reaching historical highs. China IOL, for 
instance suggests that inventory levels are ~50m units across all brands, a 
historical high (http://acc.chinaiol.com/t/0214/29207309.html). 
 
This data corroborates our recent checks. We understand AC channel inventory 
is approaching levels last seen in 2014, which preceded a decline in sales and 
price cutting for some manufacturers in 2015. Midea’s AC sales declined 11% in 
2015. Should retail air conditioning sales continue to slow, some industry players 
believe price cutting could ensue. 
 
Improved inventory management system 
On a positive note, Midea has invested some RMB800m per year since 2015 to 
develop an inventory management system to help it better track its inventory. 
Midea has 100 warehouses in China, which ship AC units direct to retailers. 
Midea’s own inventory levels are well controlled – the issue is with other 
manufacturers who have been channel stuffing.

Midea│March 8, 2019 
High channel inventory levels and a high base effect into 1H19 will make an AC 
ASP hike difficult for Midea in 2019. Recall that Midea achieved ~10% ASP 
growth in the AC category in 1H18, while ASP growth fell flat in 3Q18. Harder 
comps and inventory pressure are likely to limit ASP growth in 2019. Our checks 
indicate that channel inventory levels for washing machines and refrigerators 
remain healthy. 
 
Stimulus details to boost home appliance 
consumption by ~RMB700bn over 3 years 
With fundamentals slowing, Midea’s share price rebound appears to be based 
on market expectations of a consumer stimulus and an improving macro picture. 
Comments by Ning Jizhe, vice chairman of the NDRC, suggest that new policy 
may be unrolled to boost consumption in China, specifically for appliances and 
autos. 
 
While official details on the size and timing of a national program have yet to be 
released, news reports indicate that the NDRC estimates the policy may induce 
additional spending of ~RMB700bn in 2019–2021 on energy efficient appliances. 
The program may target up to 15 different high-efficiency products, including 
TVs, 
refrigerators, 
washing 
machines 
and 
air 
conditioners 
(http://jiaju.sina.com.cn/news/20190220/6503921159325942523.shtml). 
 
We are skeptical that this round of stimulus will have an impact as significant as 
the previous subsidies for two reasons: 
 
1.) Assuming the RMB700bn figure is correct, this round of stimulus will be 
approximately half the size of former stimulus rounds, which totaled 
~RMB1.4trn (See Figure 7) 
2.) Penetration of home appliance categories such as washing machines and 
refrigerators is approaching peak levels. However, a stimulus could pull 
forward some replacement demand and increase the penetration for some 
categories, such as ACs, but it is unlikely to prove as impactful as in 
previous rounds.

Higher penetration levels today make a repeat of the 2009–2012 growth unlikely. 
Washing machines and refrigerators, for example, are approaching saturation, 
even in rural areas. A stimulus could pull forward some replacement demand, 
particularly for refrigerators, for which volume sales peaked in 2010–2012. Even 
with a stimulus in effect, we think washing machine and refrigerator volumes are 
likely to grow only in low double-digit range. For air conditioning, we are slightly 
less bullish on account of the high base for 2018 and current inventory overhang. 
 
■ ACs (~40% of revenue): Growth peaked at 37% in 2010. Following the 
stimulus, AC sales tracked the property market cycle – falling in 2015 and 
spiking in 2H16 and 2017, when AC volumes grew 47%.  
 
The current domestic sales rate of ~90m annual units is probably close to 
peaking. Assuming China has ~450m households, and assuming long term 
that each household has 2 ACs on average, this would require an installed 
base of ~900m residential ACs. (For the sake of comparison, developed 
markets such as Taiwan, Japan and Hong Kong typically have ~135, ~150 
and ~225 ACs per 100 households vs. China’s 2017 urban/rural penetration 
rates of 130/53, respectively). Assuming each unit lasts for 10–15 years, 
replacement demand would require ~60–90m units per year – below the 
90m+ units sold in 2017–2018.

Management indicated AC growth of ~18% YoY in 9M18. Based on reported 
AC growth of 32% in 1H18, this suggests negative growth for AC in 3Q18. 
According to management, the ASP increase was flat in 3Q18 vs. ~10% 
growth in 1H18. 
 
■ Refrigerators (~ 8–10% of revenue): Heavily impacted by consumption 
stimulus. Growth peaked in 2009, when refrigerator volume grew ~51%. 
Demand was driven heavily by the rural market, where penetration data 
showed improvement in 2009–2011. Refrigerator volumes peaked in 2011 at 
59m units, and contracted steadily to ~43m units in 2017. 
 
With 450m households in China, with an average life cycle of ~10 years, and 
with washing machines nearing 100% penetration, we think production 
volume of ~45m units per year is a reasonable long-term run rate. This 
estimate is in line with 2018’s 43m units of production. 
 
Midea’s refrigerator volume grew 2% in 3Q18 (vs. 8% in 9M18), but average 
ASPs increased 15% YoY due to consumer upgrading.  
 
■ Washing machines (~8–10% of revenue): Growth peaked in 2010, when 
volume increased ~28% YoY to 34m units. Since then, annual domestic sales 
increased steadily to 45m units as of 2018. 
 
Assuming 450m households in China, a 10-year replacement rate, and near 
100% penetration, we think that 45m units is close to China’s long-term run 
rate of washing machine consumption.  
 
Midea’s washing machine sales (which consolidate Little Swan) grew 9% in 
9M18, but declined 1% in 3Q18. The performance should improve in 4Q18 
and into 1Q19 as new high-end models are introduced. 
 
■ Small appliances (~25% revenue): Midea’s small appliances segment 
includes a diverse array of products: induction cookers, pressure cookers, 
microwaves, electric fans, etc. According to Midea’s 3Q18 investor call, small 
appliances grew 5% in 9M18, but only 2% in 3Q18. Small appliance inventory 
was high in 1H18, but inventory levels have normalized since 3Q18.  
 
 
Stimulus Scenario: Sizing up the Potential Impact 
Although the details are unclear, we construct a scenario to estimate the impact 
of a stimulus. According to Midea’s annual report, the total market size of the 
home appliance industry in 2017 was RMB1,514bn. Assuming Ex-KUKA 
Midea’s domestic sales are ~RMB150bn, Midea’s industry market share is ~10%, 
across all products. 
 
Estimates of the potential stimulus impact are currently ~RMB700bn from 2019 
to 2021, or RMB233bn per year. Assuming Midea can capture a ~10% share of 
this mix, we estimate that Midea could capture ~RMB20bn per year through 
2021. We assume that the policy will take effect in 2H19. 
 
Our base case and stimulus assumptions are detailed in Figures 13 and 14.
