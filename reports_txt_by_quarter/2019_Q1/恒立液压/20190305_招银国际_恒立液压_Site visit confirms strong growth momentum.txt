        Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH) 
Site visit confirms strong growth momentum  
 
 
 Key highlights: We visited Jiangsu Hengli’s headquarters and production base 
in Changzhou last week. Key positives: (1) Outstanding product quality enables 
Hengli to continue to gain market share from the Japanese players; (2) Hengli is 
well-prepared to boost the sales of hydraulic pumps and valves, an area that is 
currently dominated by the foreign players, which will serve as a key growth 
driver for the coming few years; (3) Hengli is currently running at full utilization 
rate (24 hours per day) due to very strong backlog (monthly production plan: 
45k units). Hengli preannounced in Jan that its 2018E net profit is expected to 
grow 114-130% YoY to ~RMB820-880mn. We see potential 20% total revenue 
growth in 2019E, with potential margin expansion driven by pumps & valves.   
 Company background. Jiangsu Hengli was founded in 2005, headquartered in 
Changzhou, Jiangsu. Hengli has expanded its product line to hydraulic 
components, precision castings, pneumatic components and hydraulic systems. 
Hengli currently has ~40% market share in hydraulic cylinder for excavator 
(Hengli’s key products) in China. WANG’s family is the controlling shareholder 
with ~71% interest in Hengli. The Company has been listed in SSE since 2011.  
 Hengli has already become an indispensable supplier for its customers. 
Hengli spent more than a decade to establish its track record and has successfully 
become the key hydraulic cylinder supplier for the tier-one excavator 
manufactures, such as SANY Heavy (600031 CH, NR), Caterpillar (CAT US, NR) 
and XCMG (000425 CH, NR). For instance, Hengli has already supplied >50% of 
CAT’s hydraulic cylinders. During the site visit, we noted that Hengli has well-
designed production lines equipped with highly automatic robots and machines.   
 Market share gains to continue. Normally, an excavator is equipped with four 
units of hydraulic cylinder and one set of pump & valve. Given that excavator 
sales in China was 203k units in 2018, this translated into ~812k units of 
hydraulic cylinder demand. Currently, Hengli has >40% of market share in 
hydraulic cylinder, and there exists further room to gain market share from 
peers such as KYB (7242 JP, NR). Hengli’s hydraulic cylinder products are 
priced even higher than its competitors due to its high performance and quality.   
 Hydraulic pump & valve the next growth driver. Hengli is on track to ramp up 
its capacity on pumps and valves. Given that the ASP of pump & valve is several 
times higher than hydraulic cylinder, we see room for Hengli to boost its pump 
& valve revenue to a level similar to that of hydraulic cylinder in a few years’ time. 
Hengli is currently pricing its pump & valves ~15% below its competitors in 
order to gain market share. Several existing customers have started the 
procurement of pump & valve from Hengli.

 
Specialized cylinder for heavy equipment growth driven by recovery of 
infrastructure spending. This product is mainly for tunnel boring machine. 
Hengli sees good growth momentum in 2019E, driven by the recovery of urban 
rail transit investment. We see potential segment revenue growth of 20% in 
2019E.   
 
Risk factors: (1) weakness in demand for excavators; (2) increase in 
component cost.
