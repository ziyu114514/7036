Moutai reported 2019 results with Rev of Rmb88.8bn, up 15.1% 
yoy, in line with expectation, and NP of Rmb41.2bn was up 17% yoy, 
1% higher than our expectation and 2% higher than the company’s 
pre-announcement made on Jan 2. 
Key points of the result 
In 4Q19, revenue was Rmb25.3bn, up 14% yoy, largely in line with 
the growth momentum in 1-3Q of 2019. NP in 4Q19 increased by 
3% yoy to Rmb10.7bn.   
For the full year of 2019 revenue from Moutai spirits came in at 
Rmb75.8bn, up 16% yoy. GP margin was ﬂat at 93.8%. In 2019, the 
basic production volume of Moutai spirits was ﬂat at 49922 tons. 
Sales volume of Moutai spirits was 34546 tons, up 6.5% yoy, and 
was 3.5% higher than our expectations. We note that the full year 
sales volume of 34546 tons is c.10% higher than the company’s 
beginning of year plan of 31000 tons. In our view, this is further 
evidence of the ﬂexibility in the company’s overall annual supply and 
its ability to respond to changes in the retail price environment and 
market demand.  This also implies a 10.4% ASP increase, which is 
2% lower than our expectations though, mainly on lower than 
expected direct sales. We calculate that the ASP increase could be 
attributed to four factors: price hike lagged effect of 2%, VAT cut 
effect of 3%; product mix upgrade of 4% and direct sales channel 
effect of 1%.  
Sales to related parties (incl parent group and its subsidiaries) was 
Rmb5.8bn in 2018, up from Rmb2.55bn in 2018. Sales to related 
parties accounted for 4.3% of the net assets as end of 2019 and is 
in line with our expectations. 
Nevertheless, It’s also worth noting that sales to the top 5 clients

was Rmb11bn (or 12.9% or total annual sales), up from only Rmb3.58bn in 2018 (or 
4.87% of total annual sales). Excluding related parties sales (in the top 5 client list), the 
sales to the other 4 clients was Rmb8.1bn, 3.45x higher than the Rmb1.82bn in 2018. 
We believe this surge to large clients likely reﬂects sales to local government-related 
SOEs.  
Revenue from series products (mid-to-low end) was Rmb9.54bn, up 18%, and GP 
margin improved slightly to 72%. In 2019, sales volume of 30082 tons, up 1% yoy, and 
ASP was up 17%, mainly due to direct price hike, in addition to some products upgrade.  
Management guided to a ﬂat volume growth of series products in early 2020. 
2020 outlook 
The company maintained its guidance for 10% revenue growth in 2020. 
Looking forward into 2020, we expect basic production volume to increase by 7% to 
54000 tons, close to its current capacity of 56000 tons, which is constrained in the 
short term by the corona virus impact. 
Despite the challenging environment during Covid19 outbreak, we think the company 
could still maintain robust growth momentum thanks to its strong bargaining power 
based on the differential between ex-factory price (at Rmn969) and wholesale price (at 
Rmb2200 currently), per our channel checks. 
The company planned to provide 34500 tons of Moutai spirits supply as announced on 
Dec 27 of 2019. Assuming that this is the annual in-plan supply plan, we believe it may 
be subject to additional out-of-plan supply in 2020, as seen in previous ﬁscal years. 
According to media sources (weijiu), the company had asked distributors to order a new 
special commemorative Moutai spirits product to be called “Walking into Overseas 
Market Series”. Per the reports, each distributor was asked to pay c.Rmb2.5mn to the 
company as end of March. For illustrative purposes, considering that there are about 
1600 Moutai spirits distributors and that the ex-factory price, as implied by the 
datapoints in the article, of this special commemorative product would be approximately 
1.5x higher than Feitian Moutai, we calculate that it could contribute Rmb4bn revenue 
(or c.4.5% of the revenue in 2019) on 800-900 tons of volume (c.2.5% of the sales 
volume in 2019), all else equal.  
As for channel mix, the company reported revenue from direct sales was Rmb7.24bn (or 
8% of total revenue), up 66% yoy and direct sales volume was 2651 tons (roughly 7% 
of Moutai spirits volume). This is still lower than our expectation though and we attribute 
this to the lower allocation of direct sales quota to the listco. As per management, the 
company will provide 2800 tons more supply to the self-owned stores in 2020, on top of 
the c.1000 tons in 2019. We believe the overall direct sales ratio will continue to increase 
in 2020. Meanwhile, the sales to the parent group (or related party) should increase at 
the growth rate of the net assets, which is roughly 20% as per our estimate. It’s still 
unclear to us whether the company will increase or reduce the supply to 
local-government related parties, which, at least in 2019 accounted for c.11% of Moutai 
spirits sales.

Estimate changes, valuation, and key risks 
We ﬁne-tune our 2020-22E EPS by 1%, on average, and introduce our 2023E EPS of 
Rmb64.35 per share and we rollover our valuation to 2023E, applying 27x (unchanged) 
on 2023E EPS (previously on 2022E EPS) and discount back to 2020 using 8.5% COE 
(previously 10%, the change reﬂected risk-free interest rate).  Our new-12m TP is raised 
by c.12% to Rmb1360. Maintain Buy (on CL). 
Key risks: 1) Further macroeconomic slowdown; 2) lower-than-expected volume growth; 
3) government regulation on price hikes; 4) ongoing coronavirus outbreak impact.

GS Factor Proﬁle 
The Goldman Sachs Factor Proﬁle provides investment context for a stock by comparing key attributes to the market (i.e. our coverage universe) and its 
sector peers. The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial 
Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for speciﬁc metrics for each stock. The 
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may 
vary depending on the ﬁscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows: 
Growth is based on a stock’s forward-looking sales growth, EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for ﬁnancial stocks, only EPS and sales growth), with a 
higher percentile indicating a higher growth company. Financial Returns is based on a stock’s forward-looking ROE, ROCE and CROCI (for ﬁnancial 
stocks, only ROE), with a higher percentile indicating a company with higher ﬁnancial returns. Multiple is based on a stock’s forward-looking P/E, P/B, 
price/dividend (P/D), EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF and EV/Debt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for ﬁnancial stocks, only P/E, P/B and P/D), with a higher percentile 
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple. The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile, Financial Returns 
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile). 
Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the ﬁscal year-end at least three quarters in the future. Growth uses inputs 
for the ﬁscal year at least seven quarters in the future compared with the year at least three quarters in the future (on a per-share basis for all metrics). 
For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Proﬁle, please contact your GS representative.  
M&A Rank 
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary 
across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring 
companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 
representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard 
departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not 
factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.

Ratings, coverage groups and related deﬁnitions 
Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) -Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or 
Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an 
Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a  stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral. 
Each region’s Investment Review Committee manages Regional Conviction lists, which represent investment recommendations focused on the size of 
the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their respective areas of coverage.  The addition or removal of 
stocks from such Conviction lists do not represent a change in the analysts’ investment rating for such stocks.    
Total return potential represents the upside or downside differential between the current share price and the price target, including all paid or 
anticipated dividends, expected during the time horizon associated with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The total 
return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership.  
Coverage groups: A list of all stocks in each coverage group is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage group at 
https://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html.    
Not Rated (NR). The investment rating and target price have been removed pursuant to Goldman Sachs policy when Goldman Sachs is acting in an 
advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving this company and in certain other circumstances.  Rating Suspended (RS). Goldman 
Sachs Research has suspended the investment rating and price target for this stock, because there is not a sufﬁcient fundamental basis for 
determining, or there are legal, regulatory or policy constraints around publishing, an investment rating or target. The previous investment rating and 
price target, if any, are no longer in effect for this stock and should not be relied upon.  Coverage Suspended (CS). Goldman Sachs has suspended 
coverage of this company.  Not Covered (NC). Goldman Sachs does not cover this company.  Not Available or Not Applicable (NA). The information 
is not available for display or is not applicable.  Not Meaningful (NM). The information is not meaningful and is therefore excluded.

trading strategies are distinct from and do not affect the analyst’s fundamental equity rating for such stocks, which rating reﬂects a stock’s return 
potential relative to its coverage group as described herein. 
We and our afﬁliates, ofﬁcers, directors, and employees, excluding equity and credit analysts, will from time to time have long or short positions in, act
