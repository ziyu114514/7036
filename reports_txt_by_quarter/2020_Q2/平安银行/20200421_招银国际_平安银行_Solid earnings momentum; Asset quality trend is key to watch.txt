PAB reported decent 1Q20 PPoP/net profit growth of 19.4%/14.8% YoY. 
Healthy credit expansion, stable NPL ratio, and better operating efficiency were 
key positives. 1Q20 NIM narrowed 2bp QoQ, but should outperform peers on 
resilient loan pricing and higher proportion of market-based funding. Down 21% 
YTD (vs -11.6%/-5.9% for A-share banks/CSI 300 Index), the Bank appeared to 
be over-penalized for above-peers exposure to consumption related loans. 
Despite temporary fluctuation in retail NPLs, PAB is likely among the first to 
walk out of this credit down-cycle as we expect corporate loan quality to be well 
managed. 
 Results positives: 1) Loan growth was robust at 5.2% QoQ vs 4.6% QoQ 
for system loans. Corporate loan growth accelerated to 11.4% QoQ on 
policy stimulus, while retail loans were muted (+0.8% QoQ) on subdued 
consumption activities amid COVID-19’s outbreak. 2) Investment gain 
picked up 47.9% YoY, as PAB increased bond portfolio during monetary 
loosening. 3) 1Q20 cost-income ratio fell 1.6ppt YoY to 29.0%, indicating 
better operating efficiency. 4) Asset quality continued to improve. NPL 
ratio was stable at 1.65%, and provision coverage climbed 17.2ppt QoQ to 
200.3%. Loss recognition was stricter, as NPLs covered 109.3%/128.7% 
(+5.3ppt/6.9ppt) of >60/90day overdue loans. 5) Expanding retail client 
base with faster growth in HNW. No. of retail client rose 1.6% QoQ to 
98.6mn, and wealth/private banking clients saw faster growth of 5.2%/7.7% 
QoQ, suggesting improving service capability and stronger customer 
stickiness. 6) Capital position was strengthened. CET1/total CAR edged 
up 9bp/105bp QoQ to 9.20%/14.27%, as the Bank issued RMB30bn 
perpetual bond in Feb.  
 Results negatives: 1) 1Q20 NIM narrowed 2bp QoQ to 2.60%. Asset yield 
retreated 3bp QoQ, mainly on lower rates of return from debt investments 
and interbank assets. Liability cost slid 1bp QoQ, driven by falling interbank 
funding cost, despite higher deposit rates. 2) Net fee income growth 
slowed to 1.7% YoY, likely due to weakening bank card and agency service 
fees amid the pandemic. 3) Retail NPL ratio surged 33bp QoQ to 1.52%, 
with NPL ratio of credit card and auto finance up the most by 66bp and 33bp 
QoQ, respectively. That said, corporate NPL ratio fell 48bp QoQ to 1.81%.  
 Maintain BUY and RMB19.80 TP. We keep our FY20-22E earnings 
forecasts and TP unchanged and await further details from PAB’s results 
briefing at 9:30am on 21 Apr 2020.
