 2021 earnings in line. WuXi AppTec reported 2021 revenue of RMB22,902 
mn, up 38.5% YoY, attributable net income of RMB5,097mn, up 72.2% YoY, 
and attributable Non-IFRS net income of RMB5,131mn, up 41.1% YoY. 
Earnings were in line with our forecasts. Gross profit margin (GPM) declined 
to 36.3% in 2021 from 38.0% in 2020 due to RMB appreciation, while adjusted 
Non-IFRS GPM at constant exchange rate increased to 40.3% in 2021 from 
38.0% in 2020. The Company has implemented effective hedging program to 
mitigate unfavorable foreign exchange fluctuations, considering that majority 
of its revenue is denominated in non-RMB currencies. By segment, revenue 
of WuXi Chemistry grew by 46.9% YoY in 2021, becoming the biggest 
revenue driver for the Company. WuXi AppTec maintains its overall revenue 
growth guidance of 65-70% YoY for 2022E based on a ~100% YoY expected 
revenue growth in WuXi Chemistry segment. 
 Growth in chemical CDMO business to further accelerate in 2022E. WuXi 
AppTec’s CDMO pipeline contained 1,666 projects as of Dec 2021 (vs 1,314 
as of Dec 2020), including 49 in phase 3 and 42 in commercial stage (vs 28 
as of Dec 2020). The rich pipeline provides as a strong long-term growth driver 
for CDMO business. Revenue from oligo and peptide experienced a 145% 
YoY growth and accounted for about 9.4% of the total CDMO revenue in 2021. 
The Company expects faster growth from these new modalities in 2022. With 
multiple domestic and US manufacturing sites under construction, WuXi 
AppTec aims to invest RMB9-10bn in Capex in 2022E (vs RMB6.9bn in 2021), 
and ~60% of the Capex will go to chemical CDMO business. WuXi AppTec is 
well positioned to benefit from the surging global demand in manufacturing of 
small molecule anti-COVID drugs, in our view. 
 Cell & gene therapy (CGT) CTDMO segment to rebound in 2022 with 
smooth project progress. CGT CTDMO revenue slightly dropped by 2.8% 
YoY in 2021 due to clients’ BLA delays and COVID-19 pandemic in US, which 
was partially offset by a strong 87% YoY growth in China. Management 
expects the US pipeline projects to advance smoothly in 2022 and sees newly-
launched Shanghai Lingang site to offer better end-to-end services to global 
clients, which will significantly boost revenue growth of CGT CTDMO segment. 
 Maintain BUY. We raise our TP from RMB167.38 to RMB188.64, based on a 
9-year DCF model (WACC: 9.74%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%). We forecast 
revenue to grow 69%/18%/31% YoY and attributable Non-IFRS net income to 
grow 63%/19%/32% YoY in FY22E/23E/24E.
