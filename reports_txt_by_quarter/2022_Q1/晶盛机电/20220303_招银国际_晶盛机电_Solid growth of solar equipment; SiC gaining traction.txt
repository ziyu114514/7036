While the recent expansion of solar wafer capacity in China will likely take the 
nameplate capacity to >500GW by end-2022E, we expect major wafer makers’ 
continuous transformation to large-size wafer will boost the replacement demand, 
which offers further growth opportunity for Jingsheng. Besides, the war in Ukraine 
will likely trigger more EU countries to reduce the reliance on Russian gas and 
switch to other energy source such as solar, which will offer potential upside for 
Chinese solar product export. On the other hand, the breakthrough on SiC will 
serve as new growth engine for Jingsheng starting this year. We slightly revise 
up our 2022E-23E earnings forecast by 2%. That said, we lower our TP to RMB93, 
due to a discount to reflect the dilution from the upcoming placement.  
 Transformation to large-size wafer underway. According to PvInfoLink, the 
percentage of large-size wafer output (210 & 180mm) increased from only 5% 
in 2020 to 43% in 2021E (the industry as a whole). The percentage is expected 
to further increase to 80% in 2022E and further to >90% in 2023E. We 
estimate >100GW of old capacity will be potentially phased out during this 
transformation period, suggesting a lower effective capacity (versus the 
nameplate capacity of 500GW by end-2022E). We expect Jingsheng’s major 
clients, such as Zhonghuan (002129 CH), JA Solar (002459 CH) and Jinko 
(JKS US) will continue to boost large-size wafer capacity in 2022E. 
 Breakthrough on SiC. Silicon carbide (SiC) is the third-generation 
semiconductor material. Key advantages include reduced switching loss, 
higher power density, better heat dissipation and increased bandwidth 
capability. Demand comes from electronic device with downstream industries 
covering smart grid, NEV and solar power. Wolfspeed (WOLF US), the world 
largest SiC wafer maker, expects the SiC material market size will grow from 
US$700mn in 2022E to US$1.7bn in 2026E. After years of research and 
development, Jingsheng successfully won a contract in Feb from a client to 
deliver at least 230k pieces of SiC substrate in 2022E-25E. We estimate 
annual revenue contribution of 2%.  
 Maintain BUY. We trimmed our TP to RMB93 from RMB112, based on 45x 
2022E P/E. We applied a 20% discount to our previous target P/E of 56x (1SD 
above historical average), as we expect Jingsheng is likely to complete the 
share placement this year (max: 20% of enlarged share capital).  
 Risks: 1) Weaker-than-expected solar power capacity expansion; 2) lower-
than-expected gross margin; (3) risk of semiconductor business expansion.
