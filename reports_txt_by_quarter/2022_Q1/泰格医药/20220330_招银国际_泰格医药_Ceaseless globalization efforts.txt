 2021 earnings beat. Tigermed reported 2021 revenue of RMB5,214mn, up 
63.3% YoY, attributable net income of RMB2,874mn, up 64.3% YoY, and 
attributable Non-IFRS net income of RMB1,585mn, up 60.6% YoY. Earnings 
beat our forecasts. By segment, revenue of Clinical Trial Solution (CTS) 
jumped by 97.1% YoY to RMB2,994mn in 2021, thanks to the continued 
recovery from COVID-19 pandemic in China as well as the Company’s active 
involvement in COVID-19 MRCTs (multi-regional clinical trials). Gross profit 
margin (GPM) declined to 43.6% in 2021 from 47.4% in 2020 due to RMB 
appreciation, a faster revenue growth of low-margin SMO (site management 
organization) business, and a higher portion of pass-through fees in revenue 
related to COVID-19 MRCTs. Management expects GPM to improve by 1.0-
1.5 ppts in 2022, assuming a relatively stable RMB in 2022. New orders in 
2021 reached RMB9,645mn, up 74.2% YoY, and total backlogs as of Dec 
2021 amounted to RMB11,405mn, up 57.1% YoY, both serving as solid 
guarantees for Tigermed’s future growth. Proportion of revenue from COVID-
19 projects may decrease from 17% (around RMB900mn) in 2021 to 11% 
(approximately RMB800mn) in 2022, according to our estimates. 
 Accelerated pace of globalization. Despite a strong RMB, Tigermed’s 
overseas revenue increased by 91.9% YoY in 2021, supported by strong 
revenue growth from COVID-19 MRCTs. We think Tigermed has utilized the 
COVID-19 pandemic as an effective way to access overseas markets and to 
showcase its global capabilities. The Company had 50 ongoing MRCTs in its 
pipeline as of Dec 2021, compared with 20 as of Dec 2020 and 29 as of Jun 
2021. The significant increase in the number of MRCTs in 2H21 was mainly 
driven by non-COVID projects, which indicated the good client recognition of 
Tigermed’s MRCT services. We believe that more domestic drug companies 
will rely on Tigermed’s global network for their overseas drug development. 
 The rapidly-expanding pipeline supports Tigermed’s long-term growth. 
Total number of ongoing clinical projects was 567 as of Dec 2021, up by 46% 
YoY (vs 11% YoY in 2020 and 22% YoY in 2019). The number of Ph1&2 
projects delivered faster growth than late-stage projects, forming a robust 
base for future growth in late-stage projects. Number of projects conducted 
only in China also experienced a faster growth than that in overseas, 
indicating consistent and sizable R&D investment by Chinese drug companies 
and increasing reliance on clinical CRO in China. 
 Maintain BUY. We cut our TP from RMB212.59 to RMB183.56, based on a 9-
year DCF model (WACC: 9.84%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%). We forecast 
revenue to grow 36%/31%/29% YoY and attributable adjusted net income to 
grow 36%/32%/33% YoY in FY22E/23E/24E.
