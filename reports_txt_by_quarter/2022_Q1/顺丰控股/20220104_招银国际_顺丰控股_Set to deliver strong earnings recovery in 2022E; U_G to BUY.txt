Following the completion of share placement and the spin-off of SF REIT (2191 
HK, NR) and the intra-city business unit, SF completed the major fund-raising 
exercise in 2021. Going forward, with a focus on premium delivery service, SF is 
set to become a major beneficiary given that the industry focus is moving away 
from pricing to service quality after the government’s intervention. Meanwhile, 
SF’s strategic shift from scale to profitability, together with the consolidation of 
Kerry Logistics (636 HK, NR), will boost significant earnings recovery in 2022E. 
What’s more, the potential market share gain in the premium e-commerce 
delivery segment will boost SF’s economy express volume. We revise up our 
earnings forecast in 2022E/23E by 26%/22%, and lift our TP to RMB100 (based 
on 61x 2022E P/E) from RMB77 accordingly. Upgrade to BUY from Hold.   
 E-commerce standard express a potential growth driver. “E-commerce 
standard express” is the key product of SF with a focus on the premium e-
commerce delivery segment (ASP: RMB6/parcel). At present, the daily parcel 
volume of E-commerce standard express is ~7mn units which account for ~25% 
of SF’s total daily volume (excluding Kerry Logistics), based on our estimates. 
Given the rising demand for the improvement of delivery service, we see 
potential for SF to gain market share in the premium e-commerce delivery 
space. We do not rule out the possibility for SF to initiate business relationship 
with the major e-commerce platform.   
 Consolidation of Kerry Logistics. SF completed the acquisition of 51.5% of 
Kerry Logistics interest in late Sep. With the contribution from Kerry Logistics, 
SF’s consolidated revenue from supply chain logistics grew 7.8x/6.4x YoY in 
Oct/Nov. We see strong synergies between SF and Logistics in China supply 
chain logistics market, given that the top three brands are all under SF. We 
estimate that supply chain logistics will account for 25% of SF’s consolidated 
revenue in 2022E.   
 Freight segment (less-than-truck-load): Focus on profit. SF achieved 
segment net profit of RMB20-30mn in 3Q21, compared with a loss of 
RMB580mn in 1H21, thanks to the shift of focus from scale to profit. SF targets 
to achieve profitable revenue growth of 20% in 2022E.    
 Major risks: (1) Decline in ASP; (2) further increase in operating cost; (3) 
delay of new business development.

Valuation  
We believe the sluggish share price performance since 2Q21 has already reflected the 
margin pressure and weak earnings in 2021E. Our new TP of RMB100 is based on 61x 
2022E P/E, 1SD above the historical average of 44x. We believe SF deserves a valuation 
premium, given the strong earnings recovery in 2022E-23E. Upgrade to BUY.
