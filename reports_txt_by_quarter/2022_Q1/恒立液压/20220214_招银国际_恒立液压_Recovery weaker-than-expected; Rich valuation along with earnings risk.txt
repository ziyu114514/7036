Hengli’s planned production volume remained relatively weak in Feb, due to the 
sluggish downstream demand and more time needed to digest the inventory of 
hydraulic pump and valve. We expect the recovery this year will likely be weaker 
than expectations and we see downside risk to the consensus earnings. We took 
our earnings forecast in 2021E/22E/23E down by 6%/12%/13% to reflect our 
more conservative assumptions on sales volume. We think the current valuation 
is rich at 33x 2022E P/E. We revised our TP down from RMB86 to RMB64, based 
on 30x 2022E P/E which is equivalent to the 3-year historical average (previous 
target: 42x 2021E P/E). Maintain HOLD. We will be more constructive if we see 
(1) a meaningful recovery of pump & vales sales; and (2) further progress in the 
non-construction machinery areas, similar to the agreement signed with Edwards 
Vacuum (Qingdao) recently.      
 4Q21E earnings preview. We forecast net profit to drop >30% YoY in 4Q21E, 
due to the overall weakness of sales volume which resulted in inventory build-
up for pump & valve. We expect the full year net profit in 2021E to grow only 
12% YoY to ~RMB2.5bn. 
 Production plan in Feb 2022: We expect Hengli has scheduled production 
volume of 63k units of hydraulic cylinder (excavator), down ~15% YoY. 
Scheduled production volume of pump/valve drops ~50%/40% YoY, as the 
process of inventory clearance since 4Q21 has continued to affect the output. 
On the positive side, we expect the planned production for non-standardized 
cylinders in Feb to double YoY to 14k units due to a low base. Besides, the 
planned volume of motor increases >60% YoY and >30% MoM, driven by 
AWP demand. 
 Share placement plan approved by CSRC in mid-Jan. Hengli is eligible to 
issue a maximum of 391.6mn new shares (representing 23% of enlarged 
share capital). The proceeds will be mainly spent on the capacity expansion 
in Mexico (to support the global leading excavator manufacturer and the 
Chinese customers in the US). Besides, Hengli will construct new capacity for 
linear actuator for electric cylinder (a new area that offers huge potential for 
import substitution). From a longer-term perspective, we remain positive to 
Hengli’s new business initiatives, given the excellent track record of achieving 
import substitution. 
 Upside risks: (1) Stronger recovery of excavator demand. Downside risks: 
(1) weak recovery of construction activities; (2) risk of overseas expansion.

Earnings forecast in 2022E-23E 
 We revised down the sales forecast of excavator hydraulic cylinder by 4%, as 
we believe further market share gain is less likely going forward (currently >50% 
in China excavator market).  
 We revised down our forecast on pump and valve substantially by 42% as we 
expect it takes time to clear the inventory and the market share gain will slow.   
 We revised up the sales forecast on non-standardized cylinder as we expect 
more applications in the non-excavator areas. 
 Hengli signed an agreement In Jan with Edwards Vacuum (Qingdao) “埃地沃
兹真空泵制造（青岛）”. Hengli will supply cast metals to Edwards for the 
production of vacuum pump products applied in the semiconductor, new 
energy and medical industry (Edwards is a subsidiary of Atlas Copco Group 
[ATCOA SS], a Sweden-based provider of industrial productivity solutions). 
We estimate the revenue contribution to be ~RMB200mn this year (~2% of 
our revenue forecast in 2022E) and will gradually increase alongside the 
upcoming capex growth in the semiconductor, new energy and medical 
industry. We include this in our new estimates.
