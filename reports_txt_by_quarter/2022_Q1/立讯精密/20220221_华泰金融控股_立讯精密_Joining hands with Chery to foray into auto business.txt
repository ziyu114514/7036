Signed Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement with Chery 
According to Luxshare’s announcement on 11 February: 1) its parent signed an 
Equity Transfer Framework Agreement with Qingdao Wudaokou to acquire 19.9% 
of the equity of Chery Holdings (auto, finance, and property business), 7.9% of the 
equity of Chery Auto (mainly automobile business),and 6.2% of the equity of Chery 
New Energy for a consideration of RMB10.1bn; and 2) Luxshare signed a 
Strategic Cooperation Framework Agreement with Chery Group to establish a joint 
venture focusing on R&D and manufacturing of NEVs. We believe acquiring Chery 
equity and establishing a JV should help the company understand the ODM 
business and improve its comprehensive capability in core auto components, 
positions the company well to become a tier-1 player in the medium to long term, 
and lays a foundation for its foray into other auto fields.  
Setting up JV to build tier-1 auto parts maker 
According to the announcement, Luxshare is to hold a 30% stake in the JV. Well 
versed in the auto industry for years, Chery has cooperated with Jaguar, Land 
Rover, and other brands in high-end fields and sold c 100k NEVs in 2021 (up 117% 
yoy, vs global NEV sales up c 108% yoy according to CleanTechnica), supported 
by its R&D system and independent platform. The cooperation, in our view, 1) 
helps enhance Luxshare’s capabilities in core auto parts and should lift the 
per-auto value of its auto business; 2) accumulates experience in vehicle 
manufacturing for Luxshare; both parties are to cooperate in technology, software, 
factories, and customers, and given the new presence of smartphone giants in the 
vehicle manufacturing field, the company may further expand its presence in the 
auto sector; and 3) should have a limited impact on the company’s 2022 results. 
Integrated presence in components, modules, and ODM 
The company follows its strategy of components, modules, and ODM around the 
business lines of Apple. We believe the company may expand its business 
presence in Apple's new products, and seize opportunities in the phone and parts 
businesses. In addition to Apple, Huawei, Xiaomi, and other smartphone makers 
and Internet giants have forayed into the auto domain. We believe the auto 
business looks likely to become a new driver for the company. 
Target price of RMB45.95; maintain BUY 
We 
maintain 
our 
2021E/2022E/2023E 
net 
profit 
estimates 
of 
RMB8.46/11.99/14.96bn. Given the company’s strong precision manufacturing and 
industry position, we value the stock at 27x 2022E PE vs its peers’ average of 17x 
on Wind-consensus estimates. Maintain BUY and target price of RMB45.95.  
Risks: weaker AirPods sales than we expect, and a decline in 3C global demand 
due to COVID-19.

Risks statement 
AirPods sales fall short of our expectations. Since 2017, shipments of Apple AirPods series 
TWS earbuds have achieved rapid growth, but considering that Android-based TWS earbuds are 
gradually catching up, Apple AirPods series earphones could log weaker sales than we expect due 
to intensified competition and declining demand. 
 
The pandemic may lead to risk of a global 3C demand decline. Although the current domestic 
pandemic has basically been effectively controlled, the pandemic in the US, Europe, and other 
places is still spreading, and there is a risk of a global demand decline caused by the need for 
quarantine in the future. As the supply chain of many international tier-1 3C customers, Luxshare 
may face the risk of lower orders than we expect caused by the decline in global demand.
