Willsemi (603501 CH) announced FY21 preliminary results. FY21 net profit is 
expected to grow 65-80% YoY to RMB4,468mn-RMB4,868mn, and mid-point of 
implied 4Q21 net profit is expected to reach RMB1,150mn, representing 17% 
YoY and -10% QoQ. FY21 result is slightly higher than our forecasts by 0.3%. 
We remain positive on Willsemi and believe its non-mobile CIS business will 
maintain strong momentum and drive the company’s future growth. Reiterate 
BUY with TP at RMB346.6. 
 New products to gain market share in FY22E despite challenging 
Android smartphone market in short term. Apple became China’s top 
selling smartphone brand in 4Q21 for the 1st time since 2015, and there is 
clear pressure on Android manufacturers. Third party data indicated higher 
Android smartphone inventory build-up and weaker-than-expected sell 
through. However, we believe Willsemi’s mobile CIS can still gain share (in 
RMB1k-2k/RMB3k+ models) with its new 50MP/100MP/200MP products.  
 Non-mobile CIS will help to underpin Willsemi’s future growth. We are 
optimistic on Willsemi’s auto CIS sales. The auto CIS experienced faster-than-
expected growth in 2021 and we expect the momentum would continue given 
peer’s supply chain constraints. The growth visibility in auto CIS is clearer due 
to longer certification period for its peers. Meanwhile, AR/VR market 
opportunity and demand of security camera upgrade will also contribute 
Willsemi’s future growth. According to Qualcomm’s estimate, the shipment of 
Oculus Quest 2 headsets has already exceeded 10 million since it launched 
last October. More importantly, non-mobile CIS has high GPM, and we expect 
Willsemi’s profitability will improve due to favorable product mix. 
 Reiterate BUY with TP at RMB346.6 based on 50x FY22E P/E. We reiterate 
BUY rating on Willsemi with TP of RMB 346.60, based on 50x FY22E P/E. We 
believe this valuation is justified given 1) its leading position CIS market, 2) 
share gain in auto, AR/VR, security CIS and 3) diversified product portfolio. 
Potential upsides include: 1) better-than-expected global smartphone demand 
and 5G adoption; 2) new killer app released in VR/AR that drives substantial 
device sales. Potential downside risks include: 1) worse-than-expected global 
economy that curbs consumer spending and 2) overhung chip shortage led to 
unfilled demand.
