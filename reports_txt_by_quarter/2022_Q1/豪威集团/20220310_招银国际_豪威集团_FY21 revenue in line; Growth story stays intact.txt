Willsemi announced preliminary results. FY21 revenue grew 21% YoY to 
RMB24.0bn, in line with our estimate of RMB24.47bn. FY21 net profit was 
RMB4,468mn-RMB4,868mn (65-80% YoY). Non-mobile CIS delivered significant 
growth (auto: 85% YoY and security: 70% YoY), which confirmed our previous 
forecast that non-mobile CIS will underpin future growth. Reiterate BUY with TP 
revised to RMB333.0 to reflect continuous impact from global semi shortage. 
 FY21 revenue was in line with our estimate. FY21 revenue grew 21% YoY 
to RMB24.0bn (in line with our estimate of RMB24.47bn), of which semi 
business was RMB20.5bn (85.4% of total FY21 revenue vs. 87.1% for FY20). 
4Q21 revenue declined 3%/3% YoY/QoQ due to seasonality and weaker 
smartphone sales of Android OEMs.  
 Significant growth in auto/security CIS (85%/70% YoY) confirmed our 
view that non-mobile CIS will be the future growth driver. Although mobile 
CIS was negatively affected by weak Android smartphone sales, we believe 
high-end mobile CIS will continue outgrowing other categories in FY22. For 
non-mobile CIS segment, the revenue growth was significant. Auto CIS grew 
85% YoY to RMB2.3bn and security CIS grew 70% YoY. In addition, Willsemi 
continues gaining market share in computer, AR/VR and medical devices. We 
believe Willsemi will maintain its strong momentum in non-mobile CIS in FY22. 
 Breakthrough in touch and display business under tight global supply. 
Touch and display business’s revenue was RMB1.8bn, growing at 160% YoY 
due to global semi shortage. Willsemi has started mass production of TDDI 
products for key smartphone OEMs in FY21. We expect the tight supply will 
not fully ease this year. In 2022, we expect the company will mass-produce 
OLED DDIC, which could contribute additional revenue.  
 Reiterate BUY with new TP at RMB333.0 based on 50x FY22E P/E. We 
trimmed our forecast as the semi shortage is likely to stay longer than 
expected this year. New TP is based on same 50x FY22 P/E. Currently, 
Willsemi is trading at 33.8x FY22 P/E, and we believe the stock is attractive. 
Potential downside risks include: 1) worse-than-expected global economy that 
curbs consumer spending (i.e. continuous weaker Android smartphone sales) 
and 2) unfilled demand caused by semi shortage.
