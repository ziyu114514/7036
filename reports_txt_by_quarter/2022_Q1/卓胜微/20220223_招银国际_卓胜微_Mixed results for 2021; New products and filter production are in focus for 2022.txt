Maxscend announced FY21 preliminary results. FY21 revenue/NP grew 66%/99% 
YoY, reaching RMB4,636mn/2,139mn. Top line slightly missed our/consensus 
expectations by 4%/4%, while bottom line beat our/consensus est. by 3%/3%. 
Given recent weakness in Android market, we lowered our forecasts for FY22E. 
TP adjusted to RMB415. Maintain BUY.  
 Mixed results for 2021. Maxscend FY21 revenue was RMB4.6bn, up 66.1% 
YoY. 4Q21 revenue was RMB1,153mn, up 2.6% QoQ and 40.6%YoY . FY21 
and 4Q21 top line missed our/consensus expectations by 4%/4% and 
13%/14%. FY21 NP was RMB2.1bn, up 99% YoY. 4Q21 NP was RMB612mn, 
up 19.3% QoQ and 72.2%YoY. FY21 and 4Q21 bottom line beat 
our/consensus est. by 3%/3% and 12%/12%. We believe the mixed results 
was due to continued component shortage, weak Android sales and improved 
profitability from newly released 5G module in 2021. 
 New products and filter production are in focus for 2022. For 2022, we 
expect the company will see continuous improvement in profitability due to 
favorable product mix as module revenue has plenty growth opportunities in 
top Android OEMs. Given that the new manufacturing plant is currently under 
pilot production, we would watch closely on the ramp up status of its filter 
business and its yield after production.  
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB415.0. We lowered our FY22 revenue/NP by 
9%/8%, reflecting recent weak sales from Android OEMs. We adjusted our TP to 
RMB415.0 based on same 50x FY22E P/E. Maxscend is currently trading at 1-SD 
below historical P/E. We believe this valuation is attractive given 1) its leading 
position in China’s RFFE market, 2) broad in-house designed product offerings, 
and 3) transition into fab-lite model to secure production capacity and full control 
of its manufacturing process.  
 Potential risks include 1) slower-than-expected R&D progress and commercial 
launch of new products, 2) intensified competition that erode both top and bottom 
lines and 3) further deteriorated marco environment. Potential upside includes 
M&A opportunity.
