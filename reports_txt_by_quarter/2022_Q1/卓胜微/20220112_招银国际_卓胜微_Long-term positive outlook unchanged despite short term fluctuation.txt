Maxscend (300782 CH) announced FY21 preliminary results. FY21 net profit is 
expected to grow 91-101% YoY to RMB2.05bn-2.157bn, implying  4Q21 net profit 
of RMB576mn with 62% YoY and 12% QoQ growth. Mid-point of FY21 earnings 
is 2%/1% above consensus/our forecasts. Excluding one-time gain of 
RMB196mn, FY21 adjusted net profit will be RMB1.87bn, +81% YoY, and 4Q21 
adjusted net profit will be RMB361mn, +9% YoY/-30% QoQ. Reiterate BUY. 
 Company delivered a quality earning to close FY21 despite tough macro 
environment and extended COVID outbreak. We noticed that 4Q adj. NP 
would decline 30% QoQ if excluding one-time gain. Our view: 1) Q4 is 
normally relatively weak comparing to Q3 for semi names; 2) the company 
continues to invest heavily in R&D for future products, 3) higher one-time loss 
due to high inventory (Android phones faced intense competition from Apple) 
and 4) constrained filter capacity limited company’s sales. Looking forward, 
we may see another QoQ decline in 1Q22E, considering 1Q21 high base due 
to build-up inventory by OEMs during chip shortage.  
 In longer term, we remain positive on Maxscend. For FY22E, catalysts for 
the stock include: 1) favorable product mix as module revenue will continue 
growth with opportunities in top Android OEMs; 2) launch of new 
receiver/transmitter modules; 3) progress in new manufacturing plant: 
ongoing pilot production and initiation of small batch production later this year. 
 Maintain BUY with TP of RMB450.0. Our TP is based on 50x FY22E P/E. 
Maxscend is currently trading 1-SD below historical P/E. We believe this valuation 
is attractive given 1) its leading position in China’s RFFE market, 2) broad in-house 
designed product offerings, and 3) transiting into fab-lite model to secure 
production capacity and take full control of its manufacturing process. We view 
recent weakness in stock as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain 
exposure to quality Chinese semi names that can ride strategic trends. 
 Potential risks include 1) slower-than-expected R&D progress and commercial 
launch of new products, 2) intensified competition that erode both top and bottom 
lines and 3) further deteriorated Marco environment.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with TP of RMB450.0 (42% upside) 
We derive our TP of RMB450.0 by applying 50x FY22 P/E, slightly above 2-year 
historical average forward P/E. Maxscend is currently trading 1-SD below historical P/E, 
which is very attractive. We believe this valuation is justified given 1) its leading position in 
China’s RFFE market, 2) broader product offerings, which are all self-designed and 3) 
transiting into fab-lite model to secure filter production and enhance its technology strength.  
We take the recent volatility as an attractive opportunity for investors to gain 
exposure to quality Chinese semi fabless names that can ride strategic trends.  
Potential risks include 1) slower-than-expected R&D progress and introduction of new 
products, 2) intensified competition and 3) worsened Sino/U.S. trade tension.
