4Q21 tourist traffic (+63% QoQ) recovered as we expected, and so was CTGDF’s 
rally, before the shares plunged further for the quarter’s aggressive discounts that 
subsequently prompted a 10% cut in our 2021E earnings. CTGDF management 
pledged to uphold better margins for 2022 through disciplined promotions and a 
committed price collusion with other Hainan duty-free operators. That said, 
Hainan’s 100bn sales target looks to be a setback that could again drag CTGDF 
into the unhappy paradox between profitability and growth, particularly 
considering the current fluid travel outlook. Separately, the rising contribution 
from lower-margin businesses (e-commerce and duty-paid) could also manifest 
into a disruptor to management’s plan. The path to GPM recovery looks bumpy 
to us, and to reflect the augmenting ambiguities, we downgrade CTGDF to HOLD 
on a 29% cut in our 2022E earnings on back of a 7.3pp cut in GPM. At c.10% 
below consensus, our 2022E net profits reflects 1) a troughed GPM from 4Q21, 
which, however, remains lacklustre into 2022E, and 2) a relatively flattish EBIT 
margins to showcase management’s execution efficiency to mitiagte the stagnant 
GPM trajectory. Meanwhile, we also lower our target multiple to 36.5x end-22 P/E 
(from previously 49.0x) which is now rebased to -1sd below its 3-year average. 
We trim our TP to RMB 212 from RMB 350. 
Major earnings assumptions: 
 
We cut 14% of our 2022E revenue to RMB98bn, which mainly comprises 
RMB11bn contribution from Sunrise Shanghai/ Shanghai Airports, and 
RMB80bn from Hainan offshore operations. For the latter, the amount would 
account for 80% of Hainan’s target, largely in line with CTGDF’s market 
share on the island.  
 
We lowered our 2022E GPM to 31.6% (from 38.9%) based on 34% for duty-
free business and 26% for duty-paid business. We still assume cosmetics/ 
apparels to offer the highest GPM with the former at 40%+, followed by 
watches/ jewelry at 30%+, while electronics offer the lowest at c10%. 
Cosmetics/ perfume will contribute to c50% of the sales mix, followed by 
c20% of electronics, and the remaining from watches/ alcohol/ leather goods.  
 
Any supportive policies announcement, espeically the easing of China’s 
zero-covid policy, represent upside risks to our rating/ TPs. In particular, we 
consider the relaxation on the purchase of imported necessities for Hainan 
residents a trump card to help achieve the 100bn target.

Expansion of Haikou/ Sanya Duty-free complex is crucial to 
sustain CTGDF’s leadership in Hainan 
 
Following the favorable tax policy for tourists leaving Hainan to enjoy duty-free 
shopping, Hainan’s core duty-free sale channels have been captured by CTGDF 
through the establishment of offshore duty-free stores throughout the island. In 2014, 
its Sanya International Duty-Free Complex, the first integrated travel retail complex in 
China, and the largest single duty-free store in the world in terms of total sales area 
according to Frost & Sullivan, commenced business with more than 70,000 sq m of 
sales area. CTGDF also operates duty-free stores with easy access in downtown 
Haikou and the area of Boao Forum for Asia. To stay in line with its marketing and 
promotion strategy, it has set up experience centers designed for different locations 
such as resorts, scenic spots, and outlets in Hainan to let travelers experience the 
products in person while offering the pick-up service when they depart Hainan. 
Together with two major airports in Hainan, it has successfully set up a well-rounded 
duty-free retail network.  
 
CTGDF’s offshore duty-free stores offer Chinese tourists who usually visit overseas 
duty-free stores another option. In 2020, in view of the favorable government policies 
and COVID-19 pandemic which caused significant decrease in international travel 
activities, its sales from offshore duty-free stores recorded a strong improvement. In 
2018, 2019 and 2020, the revenue generated from offshore duty-free stores were 
RMB8,010.4mn, RMB13,249.6mn and RMB29,961.9mn, with a CAGR of 93.4%. 
 
In response to the “duty-free shopping plus premium hotel” project, expansion of 
Sanya International Duty-Free Complex is expected. The duty-free shopping area has 
been under construction since Mar 2021 and is foreseen to be completed in 2023 with 
an estimated GFA of 76,500 sq m. For hotel area, its construction is targeted to start 
in Dec 2021 and to commence operations in 2026 with an estimated GFA of 96,000 
sq m. We believe the expansion of Haikou/ Sanya Duty-free complex is crucial to 
sustain CTGDF’s leadership in Hainan (currently 80%+ market share).

We expect more supportive policies to come 
 
To revive the duty-free market that has been significantly hit by COVID-19, the 
Chinese government enacted a series of policies to promote the growth and 
development of the duty-free industry including measures to encourage offshore duty-
free shopping and the development of integrated travel retail complex and downtown 
duty-free stores.

 
We await relaxation on purchase of imported necessities for Hainan residents   
The next supportive policy announcement, according to the Chinese government in 
December 2020, relates to allowing duty-free shopping for Hainan onshore residents 
(without departing Hainan), which we believe could be a pilot program ahead of the 
tax exemption initiative for Hainan by 2025. According to Wind, there are about 10mn 
local residents in Hainan. Assuming an annual luxury/ leisure spending of RMB1,000 
per capita that CTGDF could capture, we estimate the relaxation, should it realize, 
would represent a RMB10bn addressable market that CTGDF could explore. 
 
Domestic consumption repatriation  
The 14th Five-Year Plan promotes a new development pattern that centers on the 
domestic consumption circulation along with the co-development of an international 
circulation. The policy emphasizes the central role of the domestic consumption and 
seeks to improve the efficacy and efficiency of the circulation with the aim of bringing 
back overseas spending to sustain domestic economic growth. According to CTGDF, 
total overseas duty-free spending by China tourists reached approximately RMB1.8tn 
in 2019, with Korean Duty-free (KDFS) contributing to RMB1tn, 55% of the total. These 
compare to only RMB54bn domestic duty free spending. Assuming 10% of the 
spending will be redirected to the domestic market, we estimate this could boost the 
market size of the latter by 33%.

Figure 11: c70% luxury spending made in overseas 
 
Source: Company data, CMBIGM 
 
 
In fact, with the relaxation of duty-free policy since Jul 2020, the total imports of 
consumer goods grew 8.2% YoY to RMB1.6tn, according to the China Custom. 
Jewelry and cosmetics offered the fastest growth of 30%, followed by suitcase of 20%. 
This translated to RMB33bn duty-free spending for Hainan for the same year, despite 
travel restrictions amid the pandemic. Given the ambition of reshaping Hainan to be a 
tax-free port by 2025, domestic duty-free sales will remain a channel to repatriate 
overseas consumption back to China.

An aggressive online strategy 
CTGDF took the initiative to develop its online platform. It takes full advantage of the rise 
of online shopping and creates a consistent customer engagement from the moment a trip 
is planned and the moment the traveler returns home. The international travel restrictions 
since early 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic has accidentally accelerated the 
launch of the initiative. Of note, CTGDF has been fully engaged in online sales and 
marketing through multiple online channels since Feb 2020 with new functions that include, 
but not limited to the followings:  
 
Personalized product recommendations  
Personalized product recommendations were made to customers based on their 
browsing and purchase histories. CTGDF also organized livestreaming shows to 
enable direct interaction between customers and KOLs. 
 
Customer services and customer loyalty program  
The Company provided online chats and hotline support to respond to customer 
enquiries. An integrated customer loyalty program based on membership points was 
also created via WeChat app.

LNY tourist traffic recap 
 
Touristic visitations/ revenue during 2022 LNY (1.31-2.6) still slightly declined by 2%/ 
3.9% YoY. It recovered to 73.9%/ 56.3% of 2019 level, but was still relatively low amid 
the major national holidays since Mid-Autumn and National Day in Oct 2020, though 
higher than 2021 full year levels of 51%/ 54%. This is likely because China has been 
normalizing the opening of touristic attractions, with over 70% of A-rated attractions in 
the countries opened during LNY.  
 
The covid situation has been well managed in China, where the covid control policy 
tends to become more flexible in order to minimize unnecessary hurt to traffic flow and 
the economy. The surprising conditional approval of covid-19 drug by CFDA on 11 
Feb 2022 also reflected China’s willingness to accelerate the recovery process. We 
see scope for tourist traffic to trough in 2022.

 Tourism and duty-free shopping in Hainan maintained strong momentum throughout the 
LNY holiday (1.30-2.6) although China has maintained its zero-covid policy so far. For 
instance, touristic revenue and no. of tourists in Hainan came in at RMB753mn/ 5.4mn, 
when the no. of travelers at Haikou Meilan Airport increased 56.4% YoY and flight 
bookings to Hainan grew 40%+ on Ctrip.com. During 30 Jan - 5 Feb, the 10 duty-free 
stores in Hainan recorded sales value/ no. of shoppers/ no. of units purchased/ 
spending per shopper of RMB1,980mn/ 278k/ 1.65mn/ RMB7,127, +144%/ +128%/ 
+143%/ +125% YoY, respectively.

 On the other hand, in January, passenger flow has recovered to 70%+ vs 2019 in both 
Sanya Phoenix and Haikou Meilan Airports, the two major airports in Hainan. Sanya 
Phoenix has also exceeded 2019 level in terms of no. of flights (Meilan at c.92% vs 
2019). Tourist spendings/ visitations in Hainan grew 22.0%/ 13.1% YoY and 62.6%/ 
1.66% vs 2019. Duty free revenue kept tracking brightly, with sales value/ no. of 
shoppers/ spending per shopper of RMB5,822mn/ 980k/ RMB5,940, +43.8%/ +40.2%/ 
+2.9% YoY.

 Hainan province targeted to achieve RMB100bn sales in 2022E, RMB300bn in 2025E 
and RMB700-800bn in 2030E, which imply a 65%+ YoY growth in 2022E, a 44%+ 
CAGR in 2023E-25E and a 21%+ CAGR in 2026E-30E. Its 2025 target implies a nearly 
five-fold growth potential vs RMB60.2bn revenue in 2021. Longer term, we think CTGDF 
would likely be the major beneficiary from the expansion of Hainan duty free market, 
given a 80%+ estimated market share on the Island.
