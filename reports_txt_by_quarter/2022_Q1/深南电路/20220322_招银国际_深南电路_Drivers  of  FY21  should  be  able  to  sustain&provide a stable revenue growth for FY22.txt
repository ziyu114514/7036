Shennan Circuits’ FY21 revenue was RMB13.9bn, up 20.2% YoY. NP was 
RMB1.5bn, up 3.5% YoY. Revenue/NP was largely in line with our forecasts 
(6%/4% higher than estimates). We saw good revenue growth from substrate and 
strong demand from data center/auto clients, but overall macro environment 
remains tough. Given limited incremental capacity to be released this year, we 
maintain HOLD, with unchanged TP of RMB110.75. 
 Substrate/PCBA business outperformed PCB in FY21. FY21 revenue/NP 
grew 20.2%/3.5% YoY. By segment, the revenue of PCB/PCBA/substrate 
increased 5.1%/67.2%/56.3% YoY. Datacenter/auto demand was strong (rev. 
grew 45%/150% YoY in 2021). However, telecom market, which was 
Shennan’s core PCB revenue contributor, experienced slower growth. 
Meanwhile, PCB’s GPM also declined due to lower utilization rate and material 
price increase, etc., but was partially offset by higher substrate GPM as a 
result of strong semi demand.  
 PCB demand from selected subsectors to remain strong, but overall 
macro environment is tough. We expect domestic telecom demand will 
have modest growth in 2022. According to MIIT, ~600k 5G BTS will be built 
this year (vs. 654k/588k in FY21/FY20). Overseas demand could be stronger 
as 5G deployment ramps up. PCB revenue growth will again be driven by 
datacenter and auto demand. Nantong factory (Phase III) is expected to 
contribute some new capacity as production line continues to ramp up.  
 Looking forward, substrate business will continue to outperform. 
According to Prismark, package substrate is one of the leading growth drivers 
among the PCB segments in 2021. Shennan’s substrate revenue grew 56.3% 
YoY in 2021. Memory orders grew 140% YoY as Wuxi factory has entered 
mass production stage. The company has planned to expand high-end FC IC 
substrate manufacture, but new capacity is expected to contribute in 2023/24. 
 Maintain HOLD, with unchanged TP of RMB110.75. We are selectively 
optimistic on PCB growth as overall macro environment is tough. We believe 
substrate and datacenter/auto PCB demand will remain very strong. Given 
limited incremental capacity to be released this year, we think the stock is fairly 
valued at the moment. Maintain HOLD, with unchanged TP of RMB110.75.
