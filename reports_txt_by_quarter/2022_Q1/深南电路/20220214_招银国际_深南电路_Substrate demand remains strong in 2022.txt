Shennan Circuits raised RMB2.55bn through a private placement on Thursday, 
and key participants include National IC industry Investment Fund. The proceeds 
will be used to expand high-end flip chip IC substrate manufacture. Although we 
think substrate demand will remain strong, the new capacity will not contribute 
much before end of 2023. In addition, we believe the positive news have been 
priced in and the stock is fairly valued. Maintain HOLD with TP of RMB110.75. 
 National IC Industry Investment Fund (Phase II) invested in Shennan’s 
recent private placement. Shennan Circuits raised RMB2.55bn through a 
private placement. The company issued 23.7mn shares at a price of 
RMB107.62. There are 19 participants including Huatai Securities, National 
IC industry Investment Fund, JP Morgan Chase, UBS, etc. The fund will be 
used to expand Shennan’s capacity in high-end flip chip IC substrate 
manufactures. In 1H21, substrate business accounted for ~19% of total 
revenue.  
 IC substrate supply is expected to remain tight. We saw substrate demand 
was strong since last year as we pointed out in our previous reports. Shennan 
has announced new capacity in Guangzhou factory, with planned capacity of 
200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RF/FC-CSP. Looking forward, we believe the 
demand will remain strong. BT substrate is expected to be tight at least in 
1H22,while the supply of ABF substrate will fall short throughout 2022.  
 Shennan’s current substrate capacity is under full production; new 
capacity will contribute in 2023/34E. Shennan’s existing substrate capacity 
has been in full production since 2020, driven by strong semiconductor 
demand. Current substrate capacity is 30w per year. New substrate capacity 
includes Wuxi, Jiangsu and Guangzhou, Guangdong. 
 Maintain HOLD with TP of RMB110.75. Although we think substrate demand 
will remain strong, the company’s current capacity is under full production and 
new capacity will not contribute before end of 2023. As the positive news have 
been priced in, we think the stock is fairly valued at the moment. Potential 
upside risks include faster-than-expected decline of material costs, higher-
than-expected 5G infrastructure spending and consumer demand.

Company capacity 
Shennan’s PCB capacity was about 200w sq m per year. The capacity of the Company’s 
PCB production was ~80-85% in 1H21. New PCB capacity includes 1) Phase II plant in 
Nantong, Jiangsu (58w sq m, currently ramping up in the mid-to-late stage) and 2) Phase 
III plant in Nantong, Jiangsu (expected to begin production in 4Q22).  
Shennan’s substrate capacity was 30w per year. New substrate capacity includes 1) Wuxi, 
Jiangsu (60w, high-end substrate, currently ramping up in the late stage) and 2) 
Guangzhou, Guangdong (expected to begin production in 2023).  
Shennan announced to expand substrate capacity in Guangzhou production base, which 
will add 200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RF/FC-CSP substrate capacity. We expect the 
new project to contribute revenue in 2023/24E. Shennan’s existing substrate capacity has 
been in full production since last year, driven by strong semiconductor demand.
