We trim our 2021E net profits by 1.5% to RMB8,902mn subsequent to our 
incorporation of a 0.9pp higher opex ratio (of 28.7%) for 4Q21 due to any 
promotional expense for the Winter Olympics. In other words, we lowered our 
4Q21E net profit estimate to RMB958mn which is now about 2% below 
consensus. Meanwhile, we leave our 2021E top line largely unchanged, as we 
expect 4Q shipment growth (+11.6% YoY) to sequentially improve from 8.6% in 
3Q. We extrapolated our revised forecasts, and as such we cut ~4% of our 2022E 
net profits which explained our lowered TP of RMB46.5 (from RMB50.0). We are 
buy-rated, but we prefer CR Beer (291HK, Buy) and Mengniu (2319HK, Buy) 
within our China Consumer Staples coverage universe for a potentially lower 
earnings volatility into the result seasons. 
 A steady 4Q top line. Sales in liquid milk improved vs 3Q21 when IMF 
continued to track strongly. Based on Nielsen data, Yili’s market share in IMF 
expanded 1.6ppt YoY to 7.1% in Nov 2021, despite regional outbreaks in the 
country during the quarter. Low temp milk recorded steady top line growth in 
the quarter but has not yet broken even, which is a common situation faced 
by the sector at the current stage, given still limited scale, high cold chain 
logistic cost, and the need of time to grow consumer habits. 
 4Q21 margins still under presssure. 4Q21 margins went under relatively 
high pressure compared to 3Q21, due to a still-high raw milk price and a higher 
selling expense ratio, largely due to increased advertising campaigns 
including those for Winter Olympics. It is unlikely, in our view, to see significant 
reduction in selling expense ratio in the near term as the company plans to 
keep investing in emerging categories such as IMF, low temp milk, cheese. 
Management expected full-year NPM to improve by about 0.5ppt YoY. 
 Valuation. Our TP is based on an updated 28.5x (from 29.0x) end-22E P/E 
which still represents +1sd above its 3-year average. In our view, our 
methodology reflects Yili’s solid growth roadmap which likely manifests into a 
guided approximately 0.5ppt margins expansion per annum.

Yili Industrial (600887 CH) NDR key takeaways 
Yili management joined our NDR and shared with us the company’s recent business 
developments. We summarized below the key updates on the company’s 4Q21 and Jan 
2022-to-date performance and some topics of major market interest.  
 
 A steady 4Q top line. Sales in liquid milk improved vs 3Q21. IMF continued to track 
strongly. Based on Nielsen data, Yili’s market share in IMF expanded 1.6pp YoY to 
7.1% in Nov 2021, despite regional outbreaks in the country during the quarter. Low 
temp milk recorded steady top line growth in the quarter but has not yet broken even, 
which is a common situation faced by the sector at the current stage, given still limited 
scale, high cold chain logistic cost, and the need of time to grow consumer habits. 
 4Q21 margins still under presssure. 4Q21 margins went under relatively high 
pressure compared to 3Q21, due to a still-high raw milk price and a higher selling 
expense ratio, largely due to increased advertising campaigns including those for Winter 
Olympics. It is unlikely, in our view, to see significant reduction in selling expense ratio 
in the near term as the company plans to keep investing in emerging categories such 
as IMF, low temp milk, cheese. Management expected full year NPM expected to 
improve by about 0.5pp YoY. 
 2022E outlook and longer-term targets. Management guided for a healthy pace of 
channel stocking in Jan 2022-to-date. The company targets to achieve double-digit 
revenue growth in 2022E, and to rank among the top 3 players globally by 2025E, with 
steady growth in liquid milk ，a 25%+ CAGR in IMF and high growth in smaller 
categories such as cheese, low temp milk. The company targets to maintain steady 
margin expansion so as to achieve ~9-10% NPM by 2025E. Management also expects 
the sector to see further consolidation going forward.  
 Cost pressure from raw milk price hike expect to ease in 2022E. Raw milk price 
increase decelerated in 4Q21 QoQ, with the increase falling to LSD in Oct and Nov 
2021. Management estimated raw milk price to record a HSD increase YoY for 2021, 
and expect the price to relatively stabilize at high levels in 2022E, which should lead to 
easing cost pressure for Yili. The company sounds reserved on further price hikes in 
2022E, after it has increased the prices of some SKUs in Jan and end 2021. 
 Development of IMF business and the strategic investment in Ausnutria. The IMF 
inventory maintained at quite healthy level in 4Q21 and Jan 2022-to-date. The company 
targeted to become the second largest player in IMF in 2022E and achieve a CAGR of 
25%+ by 2025E before the strategic investment in Ausnutria. According to management, 
it could even beat the target with synergies from Ausnutria in terms of supply chain 
integration, product extension (to other health care products) and channels expansion. 
Financial impact from the merger would be reflected in 2Q22, according to management.
