Spending for future in lithium; potash
recovery limited; Hold
Fivefold expansion in lithium carbonate
Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) could be a new medium term growth driver for QSLI
as the company started construction of two new battery-grade lithium carbonate
projects with a total capacity of 50ktpa. The ﬁrst one (30ktpa) is under Qinghai
Salt Lake BYD Resource Development Co (49.5% held by QSLI). The second one
(20ktpa) is an expansion under Lanke Lithium (51.4% held by QSLI). In 2017,
Lanke Lithium produced 8kt of lithium carbonate with most being industry-grade,
and expect to reach full capacity at 10kton in 2018E. The new projects are
expected to be completed by the end of 2019. With the new capacity starting to
contribute, we expect Li2CO3 segment proﬁt to increase by 40% CAGR during
2017-20E while the potash segment proﬁt should increase by 12% CAGR.
Strolling on funding pressure
The two Li2CO3 projects will continue to add pressure on QSLI's stretched
balance sheet. The two projects require a total capex of RMB8.0bn and under
70% / 30% debt- equity structure, meaning a c.RMB2.4bn of equity and
c.RMB1.7bn for QSLI on a consolidated basis. QSLI is issuing RMB1.5bn of
Commercial Paper with coupon rate inquiry range of 5.4-6.7%. We expect its net
gearing ratio to increase to 140%/ 144% in 2018-2019E vs. 128% in 2017.
Balanced potash outlook; limited recovery
Global potash operating rates will remain ﬂat ahead, hovering at a c.75%-77%
level in 2018-22E. We expect demand CAGR to be c.3% driven by emerging
markets, but it could be volatile, as potash application can be deferred for several
years without causing short-term detrimental impact on yields (known as potash
holiday). On the supply side, we expect potash capacity to increase by 2.3% CAGR
largely driven by brownﬁeld projects, and a few greenﬁelds. Most of the new
capacities would be from Canada, Russia, and Belarus.
Valuation and risks; maintaining Hold
We cut 2018E/19E EPS to RMB-0.16/0.06, from RMB0.25/0.28 on lower potash
ASP in RMB and higher ﬁnancial costs (due to high operating and ﬁnancial
leverages). We revised our TP to RMB11.4 based on a DCF (assuming a 7.0%
WACC and 2% terminal growth). Our TP implies 1.4x P/B in with 0.8% ROE in
2019E. We see longer term risks and rewards are balanced at a current valuation,
supported by a potentially ROE accretive debt-to-equity swap plan and long
term structural growth of EV batteries. Key downside risks: 1) sluggish chemical
prices and soft demand could lead to lower product sales; and 2) unfavorable

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as SOLAR ideas on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame
of no less than two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

?
Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
