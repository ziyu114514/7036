Buying parent's chemical assets at
compelling valuation; reiterate Buy
Value and EPS accretive acquisition; reiterate Buy with c.45% upside
Wanhua Chemical (WHC) announced restructuring plan which to acquire Wanhua
Ningbo, BorsoChem (BC), and others chemical related companies from parentco
by doing shares swap, with a total consideration of RMB12.3bn; WHC will issue
406mn shares (c.15% of existing shares) at RMB30.43/share (16% discount to
share price). We expect the deal is EPS accretive and would be +26%/+13%
for 2018/19E. However, ROE would be ﬂat after completion. Moreover, the deal
implied P/E would be 2.6x/3.4x in 2018/19E, and are 71% / 58% discount to current
WHC's 2018E/19E P/E. We reckon it is value accretive (hypothetically add RMB6/
sh intrinsic value) and reiterate our Buy rating on WHC.
The world No#1 MDI player; bigger balance sheet to fuel growth
WHC will become No#1 MDI producer with 2.1mntpa upon this deal completion.
Currently WHC ranks No#2 with 1.80mntpa MDI capacity in China, shy of BASF
(1.81mntpa), while target asset BC ranked #8 with 300ktpa in Europe. Moreover,
WHC plans to build a new MDI capacity in US and a chemical crackers in
China. We believe the bigger balance sheet could help WHC to further expand its
footprint globally. Moreover, company emphasis the deal is in line with China's
One Belt One Road strategy.
Giving a conservative guidance on BC's 2019E proﬁt
The company expects BC's proﬁt to maintain at peak level in 2018E with
EUR382mn while expecting 2019E proﬁt to drop by 50% yoy to EUR190mn on
the back of softening in MDI and TDI prices in 2H18 with prediction of 2019E MDI
and TDI to retreat back to historical average level. The management's guidance
on BC in 2019E is conservative given MDI/TDI are in extended peak cycle, and the
company has a proﬁt guarantee scheme which could lead to a more conservative
stance, in our view.
Valuation and risk
We base our RMB53.0 TP on 8.0x 2018E EV/EBITDA, which is at a 16% discount
to its historical average of 9.5x. Our TP implied 3.4x 2019E P/B with 30% ROE. For
sensitivity purpose, if we assume the deal to be completed and target assets with
the same P/B-ROE ratio, we believe the deal could represent a RMB6/sh value
(+12% to our TP). Key risks: 1) unplanned maintenance turnaround; 2) ﬂuctuations
in oil and chemical product prices; 3) lower-than-expected GDP growth; and 4)
unexpected corporate actions with demanding valuations.

Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as SOLAR ideas on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A SOLAR idea represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame
of no less than two weeks and no more than six months. In addition to SOLAR ideas, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and

an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the currency of an
underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
