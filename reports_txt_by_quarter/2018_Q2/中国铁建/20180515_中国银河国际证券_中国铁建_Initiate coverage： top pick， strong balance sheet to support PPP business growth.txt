China construction sector 
Initiate coverage: top pick, strong balance sheet to support PPP business growth 
May 14, 2018 
The construction sector regained market traction, led by 1) better-than-expected PPP review re-
sults and 2) the sector’s strong Q1 2018 growth. As we highlighted in our previous report, central 
SOEs should face no downside risk in infrastructure investment, benefitting from rising PPP invest-
ment and overseas expansion. CRCC-A secured fast earnings growth by increasing its exposure to 
PPP investment in Q1 2018, which exceeded market expectations. We initiate our coverage on 
CRCC-A with a BUY rating and target price (TP) of RMB12.50. CRCC-A is our top pick in the A-
share construction sector. We expect its earnings to grow at around 14% p.a. in 2018-2019E. As 
CRCC-A is less geared than its peers, we think it will enjoy faster earnings growth via increasing its 
takes in PPP investment. Our TP of RMB12.50 is based on our CRCC-H share valuation and the A/
H premium (discount) assumption (Fig 5). The only downside risk to its earnings and TP is likely 
from the Company’s conservative approach in pursuing PPPs and overseas business expansion.  
Investment Highlights 
 
Fast earnings growth secured by increasing exposure to PPP investment: With the slow-
down in railway investment, CRCC-A secured earnings growth by increasing its exposure to 
PPP investment. CRCC-A reported earnings growth of 14.7% YoY in 2017 and 18.9% YoY in 
Q1 2018. The earnings growth was above market expectations, as the market was concerned 
about a slowdown in PPP investment during the project review period. The government’s 
scrutiny of PPP projects ended in March. The results showed that the concern was overblown. 
A total 1,160 projects worth RMB1.2trn were removed from the PPP database. But 614 new 
projects worth RMB13trn were added to the database, indicating a net increase in PPP invest-
ment. With tougher regulations, CRCC-A should be able to pick good-quality PPP projects to 
sustain its earnings growth in the next 2-3 years.  
 
Margin expansion due to improving revenue mix: CRCC-A has been conservative in its 
PPP business expansion. PPP investment–related revenue accounted for only c10% of its 
total revenue in 2017. Its overseas business accounted for only around 5% of its total reve-
nue. So its increasing exposure to PPP investment and overseas business drove a significant 
margin improvement for the Company. PPP projects offer higher margins than its traditional 
railway projects. We expect CRCC-A’s margin expansion to continue in 2018-2019E. We 
forecast that its gross profit margin will expand from 9.2% in 2017 to 9.4-9.7% in 2018-2019.  
 
Strong balance sheet supports its PPP business expansion: CRCC-A has the lowest net 
gearing ratio of its peers. As at the end of 2017,its net debt/equity ratio was only 7.3% vs. 
64.2% for CCC and 33.8% for CRG. Its healthy balance sheet allows CRCC-A to further in-
crease its stake in PPP investment. Under the deleveraging environment, this gives the Com-
pany the competitive strength to gain market share from its peers.   
 
BUY with a TP of RMB11.80: We set our TP at RMB12.50. Our TP is based on our CRCC-H 
share valuation and the historical CRCC A/H premium (discount) (Fig 5).
