美的集团 [000333.CH] 
受惠消费升级大趋势 
美的集团凭借其良好的品牌组合、广泛类型的产品、庞大的业务规模和销售
网络，已成为全球最具竞争力的家电生产商之一。我们对该公司抱持正面看
法，随着该公司在未来几年专注推出新的高端品牌、提升利润率和整合库卡
和东芝，料公司2017-2019 年盈利的复合年增长率保持在26％。我们首次覆
盖该公司，并予买入评级，12 个月目标价为67 元人民币，潜在上涨空间为
22％。 
投资亮点 
开拓高端产品以提升利润率：无论是产品数量、市场份额、销售网络还是客
户忠诚度等方面，美的集团都是最具竞争力的家电生产商之一。公司旗下有
多个著名品牌，如东芝、酷晨和伊莱克斯。美的集团将在8 月/ 9 月于国内推
出新的高端品牌。预计公司将通过提价和引入新型号来提高平均售价。 
空调产品推动盈利：空调业务去年录得极高的增长，其毛利占公司总毛利的
48％。在今年，市场需求依然强劲，我们预计空调平均售价将上涨300-400
元人民币，并带动收入和利润率上升。 
海外业务有增长空间。出口占美的集团总收入的43％（若撇除机器人业务，
则占36％），占总毛利的30％。我们相信，由于美的集团将其业务模式从
OEM/ODM 转移至经营自家品牌产品（目前仅占海外业务收入的30％），中
期而言利润率将会改善。 
机器人业务：料2018 年盈利激增，并为长远的利润增长引擎。考虑到工业机
器人在中国的渗透率仍低，以及库卡并表，料美的集团机器人业务将维持长
远增长。另外受惠于折旧及摊销费用下降等因素，机器人业务占总毛利的比
重在2018 年上升至约9％（2017 年为6％）。 
考虑到盈利增长前景，现估值吸引。由于新的高端品牌和出口产品将带动利
润率扩张，我们预测2017-2019 年盈利的年均复合增长率达到26％。我们的
预测较目前市场共识预测22％为高。我们的目标价是基于16 倍2019 年市盈
率，由于公司有稳健的特许经营模式，加上预期有超过20％的盈利增长，我
们认为这目标估值是为合理。风险因素包括：（i）中国房地产和空调销售放
缓；（二）提价导致市场份额下降；（iii）人民币升值损害美的集团的出口。

VALUATION 
We have a target price of RMB 67, based on a 16x multiple of our 2019 earnings forecast. This 
valuation is supported by the 20%+ earnings CAGR during 2017-2020 and Midea’s ROE of over 
20%.  
 
Our top line expectations are below street, but our higher gross margin assumptions put our estimates 
~8% above 2019 consensus earnings. From 2017-2019, we project earnings growth CAGR of 26%, 
higher than consensus earnings growth of 21%. 
 
Midea and Qingdao Haier, two of the three large appliance manufacturers, both trade for 12-13x 2019E 
consensus earnings. Midea and Haier both have diverse product portfolios. Gree, the third large 
appliance manufacturer, is a pure play on air conditioning. Gree’s lower multiple is on account of the 
volatile  nature of its core air conditioning business, its recent dividend cut, and current overhang on the 
stock due potential change in leadership. 
 
At 16x 2019E PER, Midea’s valuation would be higher than domestic manufacturers and in line with the 
international manufacturers.

PREMIUMIZATION TO DRIVE MARGIN UPLIFT 
Midea is one China’s top three leading producers of large appliances including air conditioning, 
refrigerators, and washing machines. Not only does it have extremely high brand recognition, being one 
of the top three in most product segments, it is the only major appliance manufacturer that has a strong 
offering in both small and large appliances.

Small Appliances: Key driver for Consumer Appliances Segment  
Midea’s broad product range differentiates it from chief competitors Gree and Haier. Pn our estimates, 
air conditioning and small appliances were the two most significant profit drivers for Midea in 2017. 
These two products account for 62% of revenues but approximately 70% of its gross profit. Midea is 
particularly strong in small appliances, where it has held a leading share in induction cookers, pressure 
cookers, and rice cookers for over a decade.

New Premium Brand Launch 
While Midea is best known for its mid-tier ASP products, the company is taking steps to move up market. 
Midea is introducing a new premium brand, which should roll out in August/September 2018. At launch, 
the premium brand will only target select product categories, but eventually will expand to cover all of 
Midea’s existing product categories. The products will be priced at or above Haier’s existing high-end 
products, Casarte. We highlight that Haier’s high end Casarte product line has been enjoying rapid 
growth in certain product categories. For example, Casarte comprised under 2.5% of Haier’s washing 
machine sales in 2014, but 7% of segment revenue by 2017. 
 
M&A and JV Strategy to Drive Margin Increase 
Although details of the premium brand are scarce (Midea is keeping the brandname secret for now), 
Midea itself is no stranger to high-end products. It has been active in M&A transactions as well as 
forming JVs with premium brands to move up market in the appliance industry.

For example, Midea’s Toshiba acquisition in 2016 provides Midea with upmarket branding and access to 
Toshiba’s 5,000 patents for the next 40 years. Toshiba’s primarily competes in washing machines, air 
conditioners, refrigerators, microwaves, vacuum cleaners, and electric cookers – most which falls into 
Midea’s broad consumer appliance category. In China, Toshiba’s appliances are priced at a significant 
premium to Midea. For example, Midea’s best-selling microwave on TMall retails for RMB 379 vs. 
Toshiba’s most popular unit, which retails for RMB 2,000. 
 
Midea’s 60% owned JV with Cuchen is an example of a JV which will help Midea move up the value 
chain. Cuchen is South Korea’s second largest producer of electric cookers, with approximately 40% 
market share. Through this JV, Midea will manufacture Cuchen’s products and gain expertise in high 
end electric cookers, while Cuchen will benefit from Midea’s manufacturing scale and distribution. 
Similarly, Midea’s JV with Electrolux is focused on introducing Electrolux’s premium brand, AEG, to the 
China market. The AEG brand was officially launched in China at the Appliance & Electronics World

` 
Expo in Shanghai on March 8, 2018. As the figures shows, Midea’s high-end brands are priced 
significantly higher than the Midea brand.

AIR CONDITIONING: CONTINUE TO DRIVE EARNINGS 
The air conditioning segment is Midea’s most important product category, representing 45% of gross 
profit. Domestically, the AC market is dominated by three players Gree, Midea, and Haier, which control 
roughly ~70% of the market. Gree is the leading player in the domestic China AC market. However, 
Midea is relatively stronger in the export market, where it leads in market share.

Q1 2018: AC Growth Still Strong 
2017 was a boom year for China’s AC market due to hot weather, low channel inventory, and a 
recovering property market following 2015 lows. In volume terms, China’s domestic AC market grew 
47% YoY to approx. 89 Mln units. In the export market, AC sales grew ~10% to 53 Mln units.

As of Q1, 2018, the air conditioning market in China is continuing to experience strong growth:: 
 
 
Gree grew top line revenues 37% in Q1 2018 
 
Midea’s air conditioning business grew +40% YoY in Q1 2018, with sell-in and end-user 
installations both tracking. In April, Midea’s AC growth decelerated to 20% YoY. 
 
Haier AC revenue grew ~20% YoY in Q1 2018, with segment revenue growing ~20% YoY 
 
For full year 2018, we expect Midea’s AC segment to grow ~20% YoY, in line with current management 
expectations.

Midea may benefit from higher pricing 
In our discussions with Midea, management noted that Gree typically charges a RMB ~800 premium 
over Midea for a similarly configured unit. This premium is consistent with our checks in the market 
place. In addition, we’ve noticed that ASPs of Gree’s top selling products on TMall, Gome, and Suning’s 
online stores are materially higher than Midea:

As a result of its lower ASPs, Midea’s gross margins lag its peers in the AC segment.

Note: Before new segmentation was introduced, gross margin for AC segment was 30.6% in 2016 vs. 30.1% (as shown) 
 
Midea Closing the Gap 
For 2018, we understand that, as a result of new models and price increases, ASPs on Midea’s AC units 
would increase by RMB 300-400. Instead of lagging Gree’s pricing by a historical factor of RMB 700-800, 
Midea will now would increase by of RMB 300-400. 
 
This price hike, combined with stable raw material prices, should support Midea’s gross margin 
expansion in 2018. We model gross margins for air conditioning to expand from 29% in 2017 to 31%-
32% in 2018-2020. Our gross margin assumptions for Midea are still below Gree, but in line with Haier’s 
current AC margins.

EXPORTS: MARGIN OPPORTUNITY 
Midea derives 43% of its total revenue (35% of its appliances revenue) from international markets, while 
Gree and Haier historically have derived 15-20% respectively. Midea sells products to over 200 
countries around the globe, and owns 12 production facilities outside of China (in addition to 17 
production centres domestically).

We are positive to Midea’s exposure to markets outside of China in the following ways: 
1. International diversification insulates Midea from from swings in China’s domestic economy real 
estate market 
2. Sales to countries with lower penetration rates of appliance ownership exposes Midea to 
geographies with higher potential long-term growth.  
3. Margins to improve in the medium term as Midea shifts from OEM business model to its own 
branded products. Gross margins on international sales are currently about 5% lower than 
domestic sales. According to Midea, 70% of exports are comprised of OEM and ODM business, 
with only 30% of the mix comprised of Midea’s branded products.

ROBOTICS: PPA EXPENSE WINDING DOWN 
PPA Expense Winding Down  
Midea has been active in expanding into the robotics field in recent years. Robotics overlaps with its 
core manufacturing business and provides a new growth driver and further diversification for the 
company. In 2017, Midea acquired Germany’s Kuka, a leading robotics company, by boosting its stake 
in Kuka from 13.5% to 94.55%. Midea spent EUR 3.7 Bln (RMB 27 Bln) for 81% of Kuka. 
Although robotics only comprised ~6% of Midea’s gross profit in 2017, we expect this figure to increase 
to 9% in 2018. The increase in gross profit for 2018 is driven by acquisition expenses beginning to roll 
off. In 2017, Midea wrote off ~RMB 2.4 Bln on the Kuka and Toshiba acquisitions, but annual 
amortization will reduce to ~RMB 0.6 Bln in 2018. On this basis, we expect gross margin for the robotics 
segment to rebound to ~21% in 2018, up from 14.5% in 2017. 
Midea - Building Robotics Expertise 
Midea’s Kuka acquisition was not Midea’s first foray into the robotics field. Prior completing the Kuka 
acquisition in 2017, Midea owned 13.5% of Kuka, and has been gradually building expertise in the 
robotics market for several years. Some important steps include the following: 
 
1. Prior to the Kuka acquisition, Midea was a long term Kuka customer, spending ~RMB 1-1.5 Bln 
annually on Kuka robots. Midea uses Kuka’s robots primarily for packaging, transportation, and 
paint spraying tasks. Midea’s increased use of robotics helped the company reduce its staff 
count from 200,000 in 2011 to around 120,000 by 2016. 
2. In 2015, Midea invested USD 65 Mln to enter into two JVs with Japanese robot manufacturer 
Yaskawa. Yaskawa is one of the top 4 robotics producers globally, which include ABB (ABBN. 
VX), Fanuc (6954.JP), Yaskawa (6506.JP), and Kuka. One of the JVs is focused on bringing 
Yaskawa’s robots for elder care and physical therapy to the China market. The second JV is 
focused on bringing Yaskawa’s industrial robots to the China market. 
3. In 2016, Midea purchased 17.8% of Anhui Efort for USD 8 Mln (RMB 45 Mln). Anhui Effort 
builds robots for car painting (auto industry), as well as logistics, welding, painting, and 
assembly. 
4. In 2017, Midea acquired a controlling stake in Servotronix for USD 170 Mln. Servotronix an 
Israeli tech company which provides motion control systems including servo drives, encoders, 
and multi axis motion controllers for industrial robots. 
 
Long Term Robotics Opportunity 
Growth prospects for robotics in China are promising for three reasons: (1) increasing wage rates in the 
manufacturing sector, (2) an aging population, and (3) low robotics penetration, especially outside the 
auto industry.

Kuka, based in Germany, has been historically more focused on the German automotive market. At the 
time of acquisition, around half of Kuka’s sales were from the auto segment, and half of sales come from 
Europe. In this context, Kuka is relatively underexposed to the China market, with only ~18% of sales 
from China in 2017. China was responsible for ~30% of total robot demand in 2016, or 87,000 out of 
288,000 robots sold according to the International Federation of Robotics Federation (IFR). China’s 
share is expected to further increase 40% of global robot sales by 2020. 
Midea’s local market knowledge, production capabilities, and relationships can support Kuka’s 
development in China. Midea’s customer relationships in fields such as logistics may also prove value 
accretive. In 2017, for example, Kuka entered into a JV with Annto Logistics, Midea’s logistics subsidiary 
which is focused on appliance distribution. The JV between Annto and Kuka will develop a standardized 
logistics system for Annto’s customers – allowing Kuka to leverage Annto’s customer relationships. 
General Industry Robotics Driving Growth 
Kuka reorganized its business segments in Q1 2018. The new Auto segment (formerly Systems) 
comprises about 50% of Kuka’s revenue mix. Globally Kuka is the leading provider of robots to the auto 
industry, but the company is trying to diversify into less heavily penetrated fields such as general 
 
 
12 
` 
manufacturing assembly (Industries segment, 30% of revenue) and company intra-logistics (Consumer 
& Logistics segment, 20% of revenue). 
Kuka grew 18% YoY in 2018 and earned a 3% EBIT margin. By 2020, management expects Kuka to 
achieve revenues of EUR 4.5Bln, implying 10% CAGR growth. Considering Kuka’s 2013-2017 growth 
CAGR of 18%, we think management’s expectations of 10% growth through 2020 are conservative. 
Through 2020, management expects EBIT margins to improve to ~7.5%, up from 3.9% adjusted EBIT 
margins in 2017 on the back of growth in general industry and logistics.

RISK FACTORS 
Earnings Volatility 
The residential air conditioning business in China is highly volatile due to its dependency on weather, 
the real estate market, and channel inventory swings. In particular, the investment community has 
limited insight into distributor inventory levels. Visibility is poor, and the segment comprises nearly half of 
revenue and gross profit. 
 
Loss of Sales Volume 
Midea is hiking prices on air conditioners and closing its pricing differential with Gree. It remains to be 
seen if the market will accept these price increases, and if Midea can continue to maintain its current 
level of market share in a scenario with higher pricing. 
 
Interest and Investment Income 
Over the past 5 years, net interest income and investment income have contributed, on average, over 
RMB 2 Bln per year to PBT. In 2017 for instance, net interest income and investment income contributed 
~10% of PBT. A change in interest rate or unexpected loss on investment income could impact earnings 
 
Integration Risks 
Midea has been active in the M&A market, most recently with the acquisition of Kuka and Toshiba. 
Toshiba was loss making in 2017 and a turnaround is still pending. Regarding Kuka, robotics is a 
relatively new field for Midea. The robotics industry in China is highly fragmented, with small scale 
robotics companies with government subsidies competing for market share. It remains to be seen if 
these small scale robotics companies can compete with Kuka, which could impact Kuka’s market share 
and profitability 
 
Commodity Prices 
Raw material prices comprise 85% of COGS. In years when important commodity prices such as copper 
and steel rise, management has traditionally implemented ASP hikes. However, management may not 
always have the ability to completely offset increases in raw material costs 
 
RMB Appreciation 
Exports comprise a meaningful portion of Midea’s revenue and profit. These export contracts are 
typically priced in USD. If the RMB appreciates meaningfully to the USD, Midea’s profitability could be 
adversely impacted

COMPANY BACKGROUND 
 
History of the Group 
Midea Group was founded by He Xiangjian in Shunde, Guangdong in 1968. Starting with only RMB 
5,000 to open a workshop for the production of bottle lids, He Xiangjian has since turned Midea into one 
of the most successful private companies in China, as well as a Fortune Global 500 company. 
 
Midea Electric first went public in 1993 in Shenzhen. It was controlled by Midea Holding, which is owned 
by He Xiangjian and his family. In August 2012, the board of Midea Group announced named Fang 
Hongbo, Chairman and President of Guangdong Midea Electric, was subsequently named as the new 
Chairman of Midea Group. 
 
In 2013, Midea went under restructuring. Midea Electric was delisted, and Midea Group (000333 CH) 
made its IPO. After listing, the business of Midea Holding was limited to non-core activities including 
property and financial investments. Midea Holding still holds 33.6% of the list co. and is controlled by He 
Xiangjian and his family. 
 
At the end of 2014, the Chinese electronics giant Xiaomi invested RMB1.2 billion by acquiring 1.3% 
shares of Midea Group, inaugurating a meaningful partnership between the two domestic giants. As of 
the end of 2017, Midea has established a global platform of more than 200 subsidiaries, over 60 
overseas branches and 12 strategic business units.  
 
Shareholding Structure 
At the latest date, the current Chairman of Midea Group Fang Hongbo owns 2.1% of the Company, with 
the rest of the board owning 0.05% of the company. The founder of Midea Group He Xiangjian still 
indirectly owns a nearly 35% stake.  
 
In the end of 2014, Xiaomi acquired a 1.3% stake in Midea Group with RMB1.27 billion, obtaining the 
right to nominate one senior management member as a director. Midea Group’s board of directors 
currently consists of 10 board members. Xiaomi and Midea both describe their relationshiop as a 
strategic partnership that mutually benefits their own ‘eco system’. The capital tie-up with Xiaomi is seen 
as a welcomed change in terms of Midea’s ambition in becoming the domestic leader of smart home 
appliances.

FINANCIAL MODEL 
P&L Observations: 
1.) From 2013-2016, Midea’s gross margins increased steadily as a result of improving product mix 
and gradual price hikes in a benign commodity pricing environment. Gross margins declined in 
2017 on account of higher commodity prices and PPA expenses from the Kuka and Toshiba 
acquisition.  
2.) Midea’s profit before tax exceeds EBIT due to investment income, among other adjustments. 
Over the past five years, investment income has averaged ~10% of pretax profit, though this 
figure declined to high single digits in 2016-2017. We suspect the majority of this income is 
coming from investments in wealth management products held in “Other Current Assets” on the 
balance sheet.

Balance Sheet Observations: 
1.) Inventory increased steeply in 2017, but this could be the result of year-end effect and 
consolidation of Kuka 
2.) Other current liabilities are comprised mostly of accrued sales rebates and accrued installation 
costs. 
3.) In 2017, Midea’s debt increased due to the acquisition of Kuka (RMB 27bn).

Cash Flow Observations: 
1.) From 2013 to 2017, Midea spent approximately net RMB 10bn per year on “Investments.” We 
suspect most of these investments are going into Wealth Management Products (WMPs), which 
are booked in “Other Current Assets.” We suspect these Wealth Management Products account 
for the majority of Investment Income (see P&L). 
2.) D&A expense declines in 2018 as PPE expense from the Kuka and Toshiba acquisitions rolls off 
3.) In recent years, Midea has maintained a dividend payout ratio of 45% 
4.) In 2017, the large Acquisition cash outflow is due to the Kuka acquisition.
