MIDEA Group [000333.CH] 
Confidence in Q2 Shipments 
We continue to like Midea Group on account of its product upgrade story 
and continued margin expansion. Since the beginning of 2018, Midea has 
been the largest beneficiary of foreign buying in China’s white goods sector. 
Several factors set Midea apart from its peers: its global footprint, diversified 
product mix, corporate governance and technological edge. We maintain our 
BUY rating, with a 12-month target price of RMB67, based on a 16x 2019 
earnings multiple. We believe that the Group’s competitive exports, strong 
brand portfolio, leadership position in robotics and high 25%+ EPS growth 
warrant a premium to its peers. 
Premium Brand to Expand Margins: Midea will launch a new high-end 
brand, including refrigerators, washing machines and kitchen appliances, 
through its dedicated flagship and experience stores, which will help drive 
margin improvement in 2018-2020E. 
Air Con Sell-through Rate Remains Strong: Air conditioners, which 
account for >45% of Midea’s gross profit, saw ~40% YoY growth in Q1. 
While April and May installations have slowed to a 20% growth rate YoY, 
Midea management still anticipates double-digit growth for the full year. With 
some industry peers such as Gree reporting an acceleration in AC 
installations since May, we believe the Group’s sales are on track. 
Stock Supported by Overseas Investors: Midea is the 6th largest name in 
the MSCI China A Inclusion Index, with a weighting of ~1.92%. Since the 
beginning of 2018, foreign investors have increased their stake to 11.2%, 
making Midea one of the most popular A-share blue-chips and home 
appliance makers. Since its MSCI inclusion, Midea has continued to capture 
more northbound flow on HK Stock Connect than other white goods names, 
with more than RMB2bn in net buying.

We reiterate our Buy Call on the stock in anticipation of strong earnings 
growth in 1H2018, net of forex adjustments. The Group’s strong 25%+ EPS 
growth should support its 13.5x 2019E PER.
