China construction sector 
Initiate coverage: Dual engine to support earnings growth 
May 14, 2018 
With business diversification and a recovery in the mining business, CRG-A’s earnings in 2017 ex-
ceeded market expectations. Including its one-off asset impairment loss of >RMB6bn, its net profit in 
2017 still rose 29.4% YoY. The strong growth momentum continued in Q1 2018, with net profit rising 
21.9% YoY. We think central SOE construction companies should be able to secure steady earn-
ings growth from PPP investment and overseas expansion support by the central government. CRG
-A outperformed CRCC-A and CCC-A CYTD, as it delivered the highest earnings growth in 2017 
and Q1 2018. We initiative coverage on CRG-A with a BUY rating and target price (TP) of RMB9.10.  
We expect its earnings to grow at a CAGR of 14% in 2017-2019E. Its plan for a debt-to-equity swap 
means CRG has a strong incentive to boost its earnings in 2018, especially after it made a substan-
tial one-off asset impairment in 2017. Our TP is based on our H-share valuation and A/H premium 
(discount) assumption (Fig 5).  
Investment Highlights 
 
Earnings beat in 2018 and 1Q18: CRG-A reported revenue growth of 8.8% YoY in 2017 and 
10.1% YoY in 1Q18, led by increasing exposure to PPP investment and overseas expansion. 
Earnings rose even more with margin expansion, led by an improving revenue mix, effective 
cost control and the recovering mining business. The Company reported its gross profit margin 
expanded from 7.9% in 2016 to 9.1% in 2017. After some one-off asset impairment, the Com-
pany reported its net profit margin expanded by 0.3ppt YoY in 2017. The margin expansion 
continued in Q1 2018, thanks to its fast-growing municipal construction business and overseas 
expansion.  
 
Steady earnings growth expected to continue from rising PPP investment and overseas 
expansion: We were concerned that the slowdown of its traditional railway business would 
constrain its earnings growth in 2018. But CRG-A achieved faster growth than we expected 
due to increasing exposure to PPP investment. We remain confident that CRG-A will continue 
to be one of the key beneficiaries of rising PPP investment. The government review of PPP 
projects turned out to be less negative than the market expected. With the addition of some 
new projects, total investment in all approved PPP projects by the end of April  suggested a net 
increase in total project value compared to that at the end of December 2017. This should help 
restore market confidence in the construction sector. With the improving quality in PPP projects 
database, CRG-A is able to pick even higher-quality PPP projects to secure healthier growth 
for the Company.   
 
Debt-to-equity swap plan to fund future PPP investment: CRG-A’s leverage is not that 
excessive compared to that of CCC, but its net gearing is higher than that of CRCC. The Com-
pany announced on 6 May that it is planning a debt-to-equity swap with the subject assets 
being the equity rights of certain subsidiaries of the Company to be acquired by investors in the 
debt-to-equity swap. As it may constitute a material asset restructuring, trading of its A-shares 
was halted from 7 May. This should help CRG-A reduce its leverage, providing more room for it 
to raise debt for future PPP investment.  
 
BUY with a TP of Rmb9.40: We set our TP to RMB9.10. Our CRG-A share TP is based on 
our CRG-H share valuation and the historical CRG A/H premium (discount) (Fig 5).
