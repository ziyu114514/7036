China Cement Sector 
We believe the temporary production suspension of Tongling Conch will have a very limited 
impact on earnings this year. Since Tongling Conch is a major taxpayer in Tongling city, we 
believe the municipal government will work closely with Tongling Conch to sort out the envi-
ronmental protection issues. We maintain our BUY rating and the H-share target price of 
HK$59.50, based on 2.5x 2018E PBR (A-share target price: RMB45.10). Meanwhile, the two 
factors capping the share price performance of Conch Cement are fading, i.e. (i) the relative-
ly cheap valuation of Conch Venture (0586.HK), and (ii) the relatively deep share price dis-
count of Conch Cement-A. 
Investment Highlights 
No violation of laws by Tongling Conch. In May, Tongling Conch, a wholly owned subsidi-
ary of Conch Cement, received a notice jointly issued by the the Tongling Environmental 
Protection Bureau and Tongling Port and Shipping (Local Maritime) Bureau to suspend the 
operations of Tongling Conch Pier. The pier is located inside the Class B reserve at the in-
take point of the Tongling Water Treatment Plant. Since the pier is an important channel for 
Tongling Conch to ship cement and clinker products to its customers, the suspension of the 
pier also led a production halt of Tongling Conch in late May. The suspension order is mainly 
due to a special action plan launched by the central government in March, which requires the 
clearance and upgrading of Class A and Class B drinking water source reserves. Tongling 
Conch emphasized that it had obtained all the necessary licences and that the suspension of 
the Tongling Conch Pier was not due to any violation of laws. 
Very small financial impact. Although there is no clear timetable for resuming operations, 
we believe the financial impact on Conch Cement is likely to be small. First of all, Tongling 
Conch accounted for 5.52% of Conch Cement’s total net profit in 2017. We don’t expect the 
production halt to last very long. As Tongling Conch is a major taxpayer in Tongling city, we 
believe the municipal government will work closely with Tongling Conch to sort out the envi-
ronmental protection issues. Meanwhile, Conch Cement has organized inspections and re-
views of the rest of its production plants along the Yangtze River. No similar situation or risks 
exist for its other production plants.  
Two factors capping share price performance fading. In the past few months, we men-
tioned two technical factors affecting the share price performance of Conch Cement: (i) the 
relatively cheap valuation of Conch Venture and (ii) the relatively deep share price discount 
of Conch Cement-A. These two factors have been fading. For (i), the attributable market cap 
of Conch Cement/market cap of Conch Venture has dropped from >110% to about 80% 
(Figure 2), which is more in line with the profit contribution now (Conch Cement contributed 
84% of net profit of Conch Venture in 2017). Therefore Conch Venture is no longer a cheap 
proxy for Conch Cement. For (ii), the share price premium of Conch Cement-H over Conch 
Cement-A has narrowed from >17% at end-April to currently about 9%, closer to the 3-year 
average of 6.4%.  
Temporary Suspension of Tongling Conch Expected To Have Limited Impact
