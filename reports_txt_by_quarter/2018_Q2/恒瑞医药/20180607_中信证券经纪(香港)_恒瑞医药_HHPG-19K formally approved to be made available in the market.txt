Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine (600276): 
 
HHPG-19K formally approved to be 
made available in the market 
06 Jun. 2018 
BUY (Reiterate) 
Current price: Rmb74.01  
Event:  
 
The company announced that Macapegfilgrastim injection (HHPG-19K), 
a major innovative drug for tumor, was formally approved by the 
Chinese regulator via a new drug approving serial number of 
2018S00152. 
Comments: 
 
Macapegfilgrastim injection, another blockbuster product under 
the Company’s line of tumor drug products. Macapegfilgrastim 
injection is a type of blockbuster long-acting leukocytes (or white blood 
cells) stimulating drug for aid treatment of tumour that the Company has 
pinned high hopes on. It is the PEG-rhG-CSF injection that the 
Company 
has 
developed 
on 
its 
own. 
It 
is 
applicable 
to 
non-Myeloid-cancer patients who are receiving treatment with myeloid 
suppressing cancer drugs to reduce incidence rate of infections, which 
are usually in the form of fever and neutropenia. Different from the 
like-products (both generic drugs of Amgen’s Pegfilgrastim) that CSPC 
Pharmaceutical Group (01093.HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical (600789) 
launched, HHPG-19K has new generic name and is an innovative drug. 
In 2017, the global sales revenue from Pegfilgrastim injections tallied c. 
US$4.76bn and China’s PEG-rhG-CSF injection (Long-acting G-CSF, 
abbreviated as HHPG-19K) sales revenue stood at US$76mn. As a 
whole, the long-acting G-CSF market boasts huge headroom for 
expansion as long-acting G-CSF can keep substituting short-acting
product and benefit from expansion in the number of tumour patients. 
Sales 
revenue 
of 
long 
acting 
G-CSF 
is 
expected 
to 
hit 
Rmb4bn-Rmb5bn over the next 4-5 years and combined sales revenue 
of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group (01093.HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical 
(600789) are forecast to be Rmb1.20bn+ in 2018.  
 
Better than local rivals’ like-products. In addition to differences in 
molecular structure and generic names, the Company’s dosage of 
Macapegfilgrastim injection approved (0.6ml: 6mg) is larger than those 
of CSPC Pharmaceutical Group (01093.HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical 
(600789)’s like-products (1ml: 3mg). Seen from performance in clinical 
trials, HHPG-19K is more efficacious than Amgen’s Pegfilgrastim 
injection whileCSPC Pharmaceutical Group (01093.HK) and Qilu 
Pharmaceutical (600789)’s products are equivalent to Amgen’s 
Pegfilgrastim injection. This will put the Company at a better position in 
academic extension of this product. Medical insurance coverage, 
competent regulator has already put PEG-rhG-CSF on China’s 2017 
Essential Drug List as a Class B drug (whose expense is 70%-80% 
covered by medical insurance) but only for patients who suffered from 
fever and severe neutropenia in the preceding chemotherapy. CSPC 
Pharmaceutical Group (01093.HK) and Qilu Pharmaceutical (600789)

have benefited from their products. By contrast, HHPG-19K can’t be put on the Essential Drug List as it 
has the new generic name. However, we expect it to be put onto the List around 2019 as the new round 
of negotiation about the annual adjustments to the List kicks off and regulator attaches great importance 
to availability of tumor drugs.  
 
A brand new stage for innovative drug business has kicked off as 19 K was approved. We view 
that approval of HHPG-19K and probable approvals of pyrotinib, Taxol albumin and other blockbuster 
drugs in the Company’s pipeline in 2018 and the application for production of PD-1 (SHR1210), which is 
nearly to be approved, will mark a fresh starting point for the Company in the development of innovative 
drugs. Approval of HHPG-19K this time, which is finally achieved after withdrawal of application in 2015 
and application against in 2017, marks that the Company’s innovative drug business has formally 
entered the peak harvest time. The Company’s new products such as apatinib, HHPG-19K etc. are 
expected to fuel a fresh round of swift revenue growth as its reform to refine its marketing by lines of 
products proceeds.  
 
Potential risks:  disappointing progress in drug R&D and cut in tender prices for drugs to be procured 
by medical institutions.  
 
Retain BUY rating. The Company boasts a full range of lines of products and innovative drugs full in the 
pipeline and leads the domestic peers in presence abroad. We revise our 2018-2020E ex-right EPS 
estimates to Rmb1.01/1.22/1.56 from Rmb1.32/1.58/2.02. Given its enormous advantage in innovate 
drugs and scarcity value, we retain our BUY rating.
