Maintain BUY. BYD’s strong 4Q24 earnings once again underscored the 
importance of economies of scale. We expect BYD to prioritize sales volume 
again in FY25E, by leveraging new models, overseas expansion, battery 
technology upgrades and AD catch-up, which could lead to solid earnings in 
FY25E again. 
 4Q24 results beat with high quality earnings. BYD’s 4Q24 revenue beat 
our prior forecast by 6%. In fact, BYD’s average selling price (ASP) 
excluding BYDE rose sequentially for two consecutive quarters, despite 
the prolonged price war. The accounting standard change by moving after-
sales provision from selling expenses to COGS lowered its 4Q24 GPM to 
17.0%. 4Q24 GPM by previous accounting standards would have been 
21.5%, 0.9ppts higher than our forecast. Meanwhile, BYD’s 4Q24 R&D 
expenses were about 16% higher than our estimates (BYD invested 
RMB54bn in R&D and expensed 98% of it in FY24), leading to a beat of 
14% from our estimates at the net profit level.  
 More comprehensive model portfolio, overseas expansion, battery 
technology upgrade and AD catch-up to fuel FY25 sales growth. We 
are of the view that BYD’s 4Q24 earnings once again underscored the 
importance of economies of scale. We project BYD’s FY25 sales volume 
to rise 23% YoY to 5.25mn units, maintaining its current EV market share 
in China. We expect its overseas sales volume to double YoY to 0.8mn 
units, following strong momentum in Jan-Feb 2025. We expect a plethora 
of new models, especially the Han L, Tang L and Denza N9, to lift its ASP 
and GPM. We project its premium brands (Denza, Fangchengbao and 
Yangwang) to deliver 0.37mn units in FY25E. We also expect more 
technological upgrades in FY25 to strengthen its brand value. The recently 
showcased 1kW fast charging could also aid its energy storage battery 
sales. We are of the view that BYD could absorb its extra costs from 
autonomous driving (AD) functions (which we estimate to be RMB3,000-
4,000 per vehicle), should it deliver our projected sales volume. 
 Earnings/Valuation. We revise up our FY25E net profit by 8% to 
RMB57.5bn, implying net profit of RMB10,900 per vehicle (vs. RMB9,400 
in FY24). We maintain our BUY rating and raise target price to HK$470 for 
H share and RMB440 for A share, both of which are based on 23x (prior 
20x) our FY25E EPS to reflect BYD’s leading position and recently 
improving investor sentiment. Key risks to our rating and target price 
include lower sales or margins than we expect, and a sector de-rating.
