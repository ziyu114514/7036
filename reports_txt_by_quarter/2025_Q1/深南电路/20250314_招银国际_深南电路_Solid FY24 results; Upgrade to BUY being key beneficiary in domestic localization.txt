Shennan Circuit (002916 CH) 
 
 
 
Solid FY24 results; Upgrade to BUY being key 
beneficiary in domestic localization 
 
Shennan released its FY24 results. Revenue went up by 32.4% YoY to 
RMB17.9bn, 2%/7% above our estimate/BBG consensus. Net profit rose by 
34.3% YoY to RMB1.9bn, in-line with our estimate but 2% below BBG consensus. 
During the period, GPM was 24.8% (vs. 23.4% in FY23), showing gradual 
improvement as demand recovered but offset by new factory ramp-up. We revise 
up our revenue forecasts by 15%/21% for FY25/26E, reflecting 1) higher 
utilization (~90% for 1Q), 2) higher-than-expected DC/AI-related revenue as 
domestic Cloud companies increase capex budget and 3) better auto PCB 
revenue growth as high-end autonomous driving systems may have faster-than-
anticipated penetration. Meanwhile, we revise up our NP estimates by 12%/16% 
in FY25-26E, partially offset by lower GPM estimates considering the continuous 
capacity ramp-up of Guangzhou factory with costs from equipment, labor and raw 
materials now recognized in COGS as production ramps up. Upgrade to BUY, 
with new TP of RMB146.81 (previous: RMB115), implying a NP CAGR of 28.5% 
and PEG of 1.1x during 2024-26E. 
 PCB sales grew by 30% YoY to RMB10.5bn, driven by robust demand in 
data centers (20% YoY) and auto (~14% of total sales), despite a telecom 
decline (contributing to less than 40% of total PCB sales in FY24). PCB GPM 
improved to 31.6% in FY24, compared to 26.6% in FY23, reflecting higher 
capacity utilization and an enhanced product mix consisting of more AI-
related products. PCBA segment increased by 33.2% YoY, also driven by 
robust data center and auto sales, with a stable GPM of 14.4%. We expect 
the segment revenue to grow 25% YoY in 2025, driven by strong growth in 
DC/auto markets (domestic AI capex and higher penetration of autonomous 
driving vehicles). We project GPM will be stable at current ~31% level.  
 Substrate sales grew by 37.5% YoY to RMB3.2bn. The growth weighted 
more towards 1H24 as demand was strong due to inventory restocking 
behaviors. The segment experienced margin pressure (18.2% in FY24 vs. 
23.9% in FY23) due to capacity ramp-up, rising material costs (specifically 
gold price, which surged by more than 20% in 2H24, per mgmt.), and weaker 
BT substrate demand in 2H24. Excluding the impact of the initial capacity 
ramp-up of Guangzhou factory, BT substrate’s GPM in 2H would have been 
2ppts lower compared to 1H (instead of 10ppts drop). We expect substrate 
revenue to grow by 18% YoY in 2025E, led by higher growth in memory 
products as demand recovers. GPM may rise modestly to 19.5%, considering 
the ongoing ramp-up dilution, in our view.  
 Upgrade to BUY, with new TP of RMB146.81. The new TP is based on 5-
year avg. historical forward PE of 31.0x. We believe SCC performed better 
than expected during the sectoral downcycle. Looking forward, the company 
is set to ride the tailwind of domestic localization with its leading position in 
PCB market and capacity addition from its FC-BGA substrate line.
