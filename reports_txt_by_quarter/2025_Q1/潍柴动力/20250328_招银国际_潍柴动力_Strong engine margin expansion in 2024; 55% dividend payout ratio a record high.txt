Weichai’s net profit in 2024 grew 27% YoY to RMB11.4bn, which is in line with 
our expectation. Net profit in 4Q24 grew 19% YoY to RMB3bn, driven by 
28%/13% YoY reduction of S&D / R&D expenses despite a flat (YoY) revenue. 
Weichai proposed a final dividend of RMB0.347/shr. This, together with the 
interim dividend, implies a payout ratio of 55% (up from 50% in 2023), which is 
a record high level. We revise up our 2025E/26E earnings forecast by 9%/11%, 
mainly due to higher margin assumptions for engine segment. We see several 
catalysts for Weichai: (1) HDT demand recovery driven by new subsidies; (2) 
strong growth of engines for data centres; (3) potential re-rating of KION Group 
(KGX GR, NR). Our SOTP-based TP for A/H is revised up to 
RMB18.7/HK$18.0. Maintain BUY. 
Key highlights in 2024 results: 
 Strong margin expansion for engine segment. Weichai delivered a total 
engine sales of 734k units (flat YoY). Exports, which grew 5%, accounted 
for 9% of total engines sales. The segment revenue was down 2% YoY to 
RMB59.4bn, due to a slight decrease in blended ASP (as a result of a 8% 
sales volume decline in HDT engines which carried a higher ASP, in our 
view). That said, the segment profit surged 35% YoY to RMB10.3bn, driven 
by a 4.8ppt YoY expansion of segment margin (to 17.5%). We forecast the 
segment margin to expand to 17.7%/17.8% in 2025E/26E, driven by the 
recovery of HDT engine demand and strong growth of engines for data 
centres.   
 HDT exports accounted for half of total HDT sales. Weichai delivered 
118k units of HDTs (1.7% YoY). Exports grew 13% YoY to 59k units (50% 
of total HDT sales). The segment recorded RMB563mn in profit in 2024, 
with segment margin of 0.9%.    
 Forklifts & supply chain solution (KION Group) profit grew driven by 
margin. The segment profit grew 21% YoY to RMB6bn in 2024. While 
KION’s latest guidance for 2025E is conservative (adjusted EBIT is 
expected to be down 5%-21%), we are positive on the medium-term 
outlook thanks to Germany’s latest approval of the infrastructure 
investment plan.  
 Solid margin expansion for agricultural machinery. While the segment 
revenue growth slowed to 3% in 2H24 from 25% in 1H24, the segment 
margin continued to expand.  
 Risk factors: 1) weakness in engine exports; 2) lower-than-expected 
replacement demand in China; (3) contraction of diesel/gas price ratio.
