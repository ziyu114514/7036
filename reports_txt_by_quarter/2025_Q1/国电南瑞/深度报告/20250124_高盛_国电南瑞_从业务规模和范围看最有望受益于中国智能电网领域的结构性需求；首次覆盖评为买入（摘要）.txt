 
我们首次覆盖国电南瑞并给予买入评级，12个月目标价为人民币29.0元，隐含26%的
上行空间。我们认为其估值具有吸引力，因为过去三个月里该股股价回调了25%（同
期沪深300指数下跌5%），表现也落后于过去两年受益于欧美电力短缺的其他电力设
备股。然而，我们预计在持续的财政支持下，中国的电网投资（来自国家电网）将达
到人民币6,900亿元的记录高点（同比增长13%），略高于人民币6,500亿元的年度目
标。我们也看好国电南瑞作为中国主要的二次设备供应商，业务规模和范围最有望受
益于中国智能电网的需求。太阳能和风能在中国电力结构中占比达到15%的关键拐点
后，中国智能电网正处于转型变革的风口浪尖，整合间歇性和波动性可再生能源的挑
战日益严峻，并且可能受益于人工智能电力需求的增长。我们认为，2024-30年国电
南瑞的收入/净利润年均复合增长强劲，增速可达10%/11%，高于中国8%的电网投资
年均复合增速，这主要得益于智能电网投资结构性增长。 
考虑到国电南瑞与国家电网的关系以及稳定的市场格局，该公司可能在特高压换流
阀、电网数字化、调度软件、自动化解决方案以及SVC/STATCOM系统和继电保护等
二次设备领域保持其稳固的主导地位（市场份额为34%-70%）。我们预计，国电南瑞
强劲的财务状况（2024-30年预期毛利率/营业利润率为28%/16%，净资产回报率领
先，为18%）和以软件为主的收入结构（占2024年预期总收入的40%）将支撑其在中
国工业科技同业中享有估值溢价。我们的目标价基于25倍的2025年预期市盈率，得益
于公司稳定的盈利增长和行业领先的CROCI。

Where we are different (1): Renewables intake as a structural 
tailwind to benefit secondary equipment the most 
 
 
The market may underestimate the longer-term sustainability of grid investment growth 
in our view, which is often perceived as cyclically driven by policies and project 
(especially UHV) construction cycle. As we discussed in our report, China Grid Tech: 
Grid transformation: From cyclical to structural, we believe China’s grid network is on 
the verge of a transformative shift and expect growing renewables in-take in particular 
and slight contribution from data center & AI power consumption will likely drive nearly 
60% of incremental investments over 2024-2030E, with total grid investment increasing 
at a robust 8% CAGR and smart grid rising from 13.7% of total grid spending to 16% in 
2030E, which will focus on advanced systems to regulate, dispatch, and process 
real-time data for efficient power allocation.  
China’s power grids are indeed much newer than those of the EU/US, however 
renewables just reached 15% of total energy generation in China, and we forecast this 
to grow to 35% in 2030E. Germany’s experience is instructive: In 2011-2023, 
Germany’s renewable energy share surged from 11% to 39% of total generation, 
accompanied by a fourfold increase in grid T&D (transmission & distribution) investment 
(made by companies like TenneT and E.ON). While interruptions from volatility and 
intermittency have been minimal in China, potential grid shocks cannot be ignored. 
Additionally, we believe fast-growing AI training & inference capex investment that follow 
the trend in US, as well as proliferating smart devices for growing charging needs in 
China, will potentially provide further upside. We expect data centers’ contribution to 
total power consumption will rise from 1.6% in 2023 to 5% in 2030E with AI taking up 
around 12% of it.

The biggest driver for power grid investment growth now is the relevant intelligent 
infrastructure to ensure the smooth integration of renewable energy and reliability of 
power system: 
Smart Power Generation 
Renewable energy like wind and solar is volatile and intermittent, requiring advanced 
grid adjustment systems. Coal power is the primary tool for flexibility, managing peaks 
and troughs in renewable output. Nari Tech offers renewable energy generation control 
solutions that integrate advanced systems like AGC, AVC, and FFR to ensure frequency 
stability, voltage regulation, and reliable power quality. 
Smart Dispatch 
Real-time control has replaced traditional scheduling to integrate renewables effectively. 
Accurate forecasting of renewables output, supported by advanced dispatch systems, 
enhances grid reliability. Nari Tech’s flagship product has been Open-2000 since 
establishment, and has a dominant position (70-80% market share) in all five levels of 
dispatch system:national, regional, provincial, local, and county. The new dispatch 
system rolled out in 2020 has 20% higher content value than the previous iteration. 
Smart Substations 
Substations address challenges like reverse power flow, overloading, and instability from 
distributed renewables. Solutions include reactive power devices, voltage regulation 
tools, and equipment upgrades for grid reliability. Nari Tech offers relay protection and 
SVC (Static Var Compensator)/STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) in the 
smart substations. 
Smart Distribution 
Modern distribution networks are shifting to active, bidirectional systems. Nari Tech 
offers intelligent devices like DTUs, TTUs, FTUs, and RTUs to enable fault detection, 
load forecasting, and seamless integration of renewable and EV loads into the grid. 
Smart Power Consumption 
Users actively participate in energy markets by producing, consuming, and storing 
energy. Nari Tech offers smart meters and integrated communication systems to 
facilitate informed decision-making and demand-side management, strengthening grid 
efficiency. 
UHV Transmission 
To address the mismatch between resource-rich areas and demand centers, UHV 
transmission transfers large-scale clean energy efficiently. Nari Tech offers the key 
component, converter valve, in Direct Current UHV lines.

We also expect distribution network investments to grow faster than transmission over 
2024-30E, with distribution investment contribution to increase from 56% of total in 
2024E to 59% in 2030E. This shift is driven by: the need to modernize local grids to 
handle distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar and energy storage 
systems; expansion of microgrids and enhancements to accommodate the increased 
use of electric vehicles and other decentralized loads; efforts to improve power reliability

Where we are different (2): 2025E grid investment to stay strong 
but we are slightly above State Grid’s target 
 
 
We expect China’s power grid investment, specifically those made by the State Grid, 
to reach a new high of Rmb690bn in 2025E with continued fiscal support and slightly 
above its announced annual target of Rmb650bn as grid investment is often served as a 
counter-cyclical economic policy tool, e.g., in 2008-09 and 2015-16. There will be 
continued tailwind from equipment upgrade, as “Implementation Plan for Large-Scale 
Equipment Upgrades in Key Energy Areas” aims to increase the scale of energy 
equipment investment by 25%+ to 2027, compared to 2023 (c.5% growth per annum). 
Among the total investment of Rmb690bn, we estimate 44% goes towards transmission 
investment (16% UHV and 27% HV) and 66% to distribution.

In terms of the fastest-growing segment in 2025E, we believe it will be UHV transmission 
investments. We expect UHV investment to grow 43%/13% yoy in 2025E/26E as project 
approval pace accelerates. Compared to four UHV lines starting construction in 2024, 
we expect at least six lines starting construction in 2025E-26E. The fast-growing 
upstream renewable energy installation requires advanced planning of UHV projects 
(the process from environmental assessment, approval, budgeting, design, to 
construction typically takes 3-5 years), to prevent the curtailment issue of wind and 
solar. At the 2025 National Energy Work Conference (Dec 15, 2024, link), China 
announced plans to prioritize the approval and construction of several key UHV projects 
in 2025, including corridors from Western Inner Mongolia to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, 
Southeastern Tibet to the Greater Bay Area, Gansu’s Badain Jaran Desert to Sichuan, 
and Southern Xinjiang to Sichuan-Chongqing. We expect six new projects starting 
construction in 2025E-26E, driving the investments to a record high.

We believe UHV investments will stay elevated beyond 2025E, supported by strong 
demand to transmit the renewable energy from mega bases despite investment yoy 
growth slowing down. An UHV line with transmission power of 4-8GW on average can 
transmit 10-11GW of renewable energy and 3-4GW of supporting energy. The second 
batch of projects planned in 14th FYP (150GW of external transmission) will require 
15-16 UHV lines, relying on five lines already in the installed base, and ten additional 
new lines (seven lines pending approval). The second batch of projects planned in 15th 
FYP (165GW of external transmission) will accordingly require 18-19 UHV lines. 15th 
FYP projects, combined with the third batch (40GW of external transmission), provide 
strong demand support to continued UHV construction. Additionally, the State Grid has 
also announced reserve projects of five AC line and nine DC lines, which we believe will 
sustain the UHV construction pace beyond 2025E.

On top of UHV growth, Nari Tech will also benefit from the penetration of VSC-HVDC, 
where we forecast relay protection and flexible transmission revenue segment to deliver 
25%/26% yoy growth in 2025E/26E. About 4-7 months after the start of project 
construction, State Grid hosts primary and secondary equipment tendering. If Nari Tech 
wins the tender, it usually takes them about a year to deliver the product in order to book 
revenue. We think the momentum of strong revenue recognition may sustain into 
2026-27E. Nari Tech offers converter valves for UHV projects, whose significance 
among UHV equipment increases from 22% in DC lines to 29% in VSC-HVDC lines. 
With increased penetration of VSC-DC, the content value for converter valves per GW 
grows 2.2X on average compared to a normal DC line, and Nari Tech holds a dominant 
market position (c.49%) in both DC and VSC-DC lines.

A key enabler of a smarter, more flexible and more reliable grid 
 
 
Nari Tech is a key enabler of a smarter, more flexible and more reliable grid, as the 
company especially benefits from the structurally growing areas of grid investment, UHV 
and smart grid investments. Its products range from power generation control solutions, 
dispatch software, components in substations, distribution and power usage intelligent 
devices, to downstream control for factories. By product nature, 40% of the company’s 
revenue is software-driven. Ranking by the expected revenue CAGR in 2024E-30E, we 
expect: 
Grid digitalization revenue (23% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 13% CAGR, 
n
supported by growing IT spending by grid companies (this segment mainly provides 
products such as asset management software, ERP software to State Grid/Southern 
Grid). 
Grid automation: flexible transmission & relay protection revenue (9% of firmwide in 
n
2024E) to deliver 12% CAGR, mainly driven by converter valve tendering from the 
Direct Current UHV lines, as well as relay protection products to ensure grid 
reliability. We expect this segment to deliver strong growth in 2025E/26E at 
25%/26% yoy due to full UHV construction and tendering pipelines. 
Grid automation: distribution & consumption revenue (14% of firmwide in 2024E) to 
n
deliver 12% CAGR, due to the complex electricity information flow and the 
increasing use of smart meters. 
Power generation revenue (22% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 9% CAGR, driven 
n
mainly by power generation investment growth and also a low market share of the 
company and thus high growth potential. 
Grid automation: dispatch revenue (9% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 8% CAGR, 
n
as complex electricity flows from renewable energy integration drive product 
upgrades, at a relatively slower growth as product upgrades since 2020 have come 
near the end. 
Grid automation: substation revenue (14% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 8% 
n
CAGR, supported by added content (SVC/STATCOM) to substation, as well as 
smart substation penetration. 
Industrial internet revenue (6% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 5% CAGR, driven by

Likely to maintain leadership in various software/hardware 
technologies 
 
 
Nari Tech is a leader in many product categories: In 2024, Nari Tech had a 70% market 
share in digitalization software, ranking No.1; it also held a 53% market share in 
digitalization hardware, ranking No.1; it held a 47% market share for UHV converter 
valves, ranking as No.1. Within substation tendering, it held a 56%/34%/8% market 
share in SVC&STATCOM/protective relay/network system integrator, ranking 
No.1/No.1/No.4. For smart meters, Nari Tech held a 5% market share, ranking No.1 in a 
very scattered market.  
Market share also remained relatively stable over the past few years, reflecting a 
consistent competitive landscape and highlighting Nari Tech’s leading advantages. We 
attribute this stability to the company’s strong R&D capabilities, superior product 
performance, and robust backing of its largest shareholder, which has solidified its 
position in the industry.

Potential catalysts  
 
 
China grid investment policy stance typically key catalyst 
For upcoming catalysts, we need to closely watch the State Grid’s work plans (whether 
to further raise capex plan by mid-July 2025 as they did in 2024), the Two Sessions in 
March 2025 for energy policy direction, and the release of the 15th Five-Year 
Energy/Grid Plan in 2026, which will shape the future of grid investments and renewable 
energy policy. We expect further valuation upside to come from AI capex growth news 
which may lead to the expansion of AI-related power demand. 
Key catalysts in the past mainly revolve around significant policies targeting the grid 
segment: 
2015 Mar: Deepening the Reform of Electric Power System (Document No. 9) was 
n
issued to establish an open and transparent electricity market system. 
2018 Jul: Three-Year Action Plan for Blue Sky Defense was introduced, 
n
emphasizing the need for UHV networks to reduce air pollution and transition to 
clean energy sources. 
2019 Mar: NEA released policies on electricity IoT, highlighting smart grids, data 
n
sharing, and energy efficiency. 
2020 May: New infrastructure initiatives listed UHV transmission as one of the key 
n
focus areas. 
2020 Sep: China’s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 brought further 
n
support for renewable energy and grid modernization. 
2021 Jun: NDRC announced that starting from January 2022, new onshore wind and 
n
solar projects would transition to grid-parity pricing instead of subsidies. 
2022 Dec: NDRC and NEA jointly released a roadmap to accelerate the 
n
development of a unified electricity market across China. 
The two red-shaded boxes in the chart below represent phases of share price decline. 
The first decline coincided with a broader market sell-off aligned with the CSI300 index 
downturn, while the second can be attributed to renewable energy subsidy phase-out 
and concerns about the transition to grid-parity pricing.

Further upside may be driven by AI demand 
We expect global data center demand to grow 165% by 2030E compared to 2023, with 
its contribution rising from 1%-2% to 3%-4% of global power consumption. This is mainly 
due to AI queries consuming up to 10X more power than traditional queries (report link). 
Our GS team estimates that US data center demand will more than triple by 2030E, 
driven by hyperscalers’ capex growth (report link). 
Recently, there have been significant progress in China AI and large model space, and 
we expect AI to take up a more significant portion of total electricity consumption. With 
Doubao’s (Bytedance’s large model) MAU (monthly active users) rising to 60mn as 
of Nov 2024 according to AICPB, securing the No.2 spot globally and daily tokens 
reaching 40 trn (announced on the 2024 Volcano Engine Force Conference on Dec 18, 
2024), Bytedance is set to embark on intensive AI capex investment in China (news). 
Bytedance’s leading large model may prompt other customer service platforms (CSPs) 
to also expand their capex significantly.  
The positive progress in model development and end applications could mark a start to 
an AI capex and application era in China, further boosting power demand. We expect 
data centers’ contribution to total power consumption will rise from 1.6% in 2023 to 5% 
in 2030E with AI taking up around 12% on average within data centers. 
However, technological advances may increase AI model training efficiency. For 
example, DeepSeek-V3, developed by Chinese company Huanfang Quantitative, was 
launched on Dec 24, 2024 and is based on its self-developed Mixture of Experts (MoE) 
model architecture. The model increased its generation speed significantly vs. its V2.5, 
from 20 TPS (transactions per second) to 60 TPS, featuring 671bn parameters and was 
trained in approximately two months at a cost of US$5.58mn, utilizing far fewer 
computing resources than models developed by larger tech companies. The model only 
used 2.8mn hours of GPU compute (one tenth of that used by Llama 3). 
Overall, despite the intermittent advances in AI model training efficiency and thus 
savings in power consumption, we still believe AI applications are in the early stage in 
China, poised for compute and inference growth, with rising power demand from AGI 
applications, as well as more energy-consuming terminal charging devices (such as 
humanoid robots, etc.) yet to come.

Solid financial performance vs. peers 
 
 
Income statement 
Revenue: We forecast Nari Tech’s revenue/net profit to deliver 10%/11% CAGR in 
2024-30E, driven by leading segments such as power grid digitalization/power grid 
automation delivering 13%/10%. Among power grid automation segments, we believe 
relay protection and flexible transmission (UHV)/distribution and consumption segments 
will outperform the segment average at 12%/12% CAGR, with relay protection and 
flexible transmission maintaining high growth of 25%/26% in 2025E/26E. 
Margin: We forecast Nari Tech’s gross profit margin (GPM) to stay stable at 28%, 
maintaining its out-performance versus most domestic and overseas peers, reflecting a 
stable competitive landscape for high-voltage equipment and digitalization products. 
Similarly, we expect Nari Tech’s EBIT margin to improve from 14.9% in 2024 to 16.2% 
in 2030E, supported by the company’s effort to lower SG&A expenses. For ROE, we 
project Nari Tech to improve from 16.5% in 2024 to 18.3% in 2030E, further 
demonstrating its solid financial performance compared to the majority of its domestic 
and international peers.

Balance sheet 
We forecast cash conversion days for Nari Tech to stabilize at 271 days over 2024-30E, 
with receivables/accounts payables/inventory days stable at 187/95/11 days 
respectively. Though the cash collection turnover days is long, we don’t view this as a 
financial risk, due to reliable counterparties (State Grid/South Grid as SOEs) and a low 
historical incidence of bad debt. 
Cash flow statement 
Capex: We forecast Nari Tech’s capex spending to be Rmb1.7bn in 2025E, mainly 
spent towards production line upgrade, infrastructure and a continued spending for IGBT 
module production (they plan to expand the IGBT production capacity from 0.2mn units 
to 0.3mn units). 
Dividends: Nari Tech’s dividend payout in 2023 was 60% (an increase versus 40% in 
previous years) and we forecast its dividend payout to stabilize at 50% in 2025-30E.

Valuation 
 
 
We use a 2025E P/E valuation methodology to derive our 12-month target price for Nari 
Tech, in line with our China Industrial Tech coverage. Our target 25X 2025E P/E multiple 
is based on a premium to its historical PEG average of 1.7X (against its 11% long-run 
EPS CAGR), slightly above the regression lines for our China Industrial Tech coverage 
and global GS-covered power equipment companies, and as we expect valuation 
expansion to be driven by 1) strong 2025E grid investment; 2) multi-year structural grid 
investment ahead driven by intake of renewable energy; 3) expanding AI power demand 
potentially. We believe Nari Tech deserves a valuation premium mainly due to its stable 
EPS growth and leading shareholder return within our coverage (in 2nd quartile for ROE 
at 18.3% and 1st quartile for CROCI at 24.1%). Additionally, 40% of the company’s 
revenue falls in the category of software and thus we believe the valuation should 
resemble those of the industrial software companies (Baosight, Supcon, Bochu, etc.). 
Our 12-month target price is Rmb29.0, implying 26% upside.  
Nari Tech is currently undervalued compared to its own historical track record as well as 
domestic peers. Shares are trading at 20X 12-month forward P/E, vs. its own historical 
average of 22.1X and domestic peers’ historical average of 28X, and vs overseas 
peers’ historical average of 39X (or 17X excluding Siemens Energy and GE Vernova). 
We think Nari Tech’s valuation could expand based on: 1) strong 2025 State Grid 
spending; 2) to a lesser extent, stronger AI data center demand to drive valuation 
expansion. Nari Tech is trading at 16X 12-month forward EV/EBITDA, vs. its historical 
avg of 18.7X and domestic peers’ average of 19.2X, vs overseas peers’ average of 
12.6X. 
We assign an M&A rank of 3 for Nari Tech, due to its large market cap, concentrated 
shareholder structure, with shares indirectly held by the State Grid and SASAC as the 
actual controller.

Key risks  
 
 
1) Weaker-than-expected fiscal support and weaker-than-expected State Grid 
investment in 2025E: We currently expect power grid investment by the State Grid to 
stay elevated in 2025E at Rmb690bn, slightly higher than its announced capex plan of 
Rmb650bn on Jan 15, 2025. We expect possibly further raised capex or their actual 
investment exceeding their announced target, due to renewable energy waiting for grid 
capacity. If they do not raise capex target by mid-2025E like they did in 2024, or they do 
not exceed their announced capex plan, grid investment will come below our 
expectations. We also expect strong fiscal stimulus support, such as the power 
equipment large-scale upgrade plan. Also if the financial situation of State Grid 
deteriorates, resulting in budget cuts, grid investment may come below our expectations, 
directly impacting all Nari Tech’s product lines’ revenues. 
2) UHV project approval pace might fall behind its announced work plan, i.e., under six 
projects start construction in 2025: UHV project approvals and construction require 
extensive coordination across multiple provinces, involving agreements on land use, 
routing, cost-sharing, which can be time-consuming and complex. Additionally, thorough 
environmental assessments and potential delays in obtaining necessary permits could 
further slow progress, increasing the risk of falling behind our projected construction 
starts of six lines in 2025E. Fewer-than-expected UHV projects construction starts will 
result in below-expectations revenue recognition for Nari Tech’s converter valve 
products.

Investment thesis, PTRM 
 
 
Investment Thesis 
Nari Tech is a leading power equipment player in China, holding dominant positions in 
UHV converter valves, grid digitalization, dispatch software, automation solutions, and 
secondary equipment such as SVC/STATCOM systems and relay protection at 
34%-70% market share. We are positive on Nari Tech as a structural beneficiary of the 
incremental investment towards China’s power grid modernization needs, ensuring a 
smarter, more flexible and more reliable grid, particularly as the challenges of integrating 
intermittent and volatile renewable energy sources grow. We believe Nari Tech can 
deliver solid 10%/11% revenue/net profit CAGR over 2024-30E, outperforming China’s 
grid investment of 8% CAGR as the company especially benefits from the 
structurally-growing areas of grid investment, ultra-high-voltage (UHV) and smart grid. 
We expect the company to maintain its leadership in its product portfolio due to its 
dominant position in a stable market landscape and relationship with the State Grid. Key 
catalysts include State Grid’s work plans, the Two Sessions in March 2025 for energy 
policy direction, and the release of the 15th Five-Year Energy/Grid Plan in 2026, and 
AI-related capex growth news. Nari Tech is currently undervalued compared to its own 
historical track record as well as domestic peers. However, we expect the company’s 
strong financial profile (GPM/OPM at 28%/16% and a leading ROE of 18% expected in 
2024-30E) and its software-heavy revenue mix (40% of total 2024E revenue) to support 
a valuation premium for Nari Tech among its China industrial tech peers, and hence we 
are Buy-rated on Nari Tech. 
Price Target Risks & Methodology 
Our 12-month target price of Rmb29.0 is based on 25X 2025E P/E. Key risks include: 1) 
Lower-than-expected fiscal support and the State Grid announcement for 2025 budget, 
2) UHV project approval pace falling behind its announced work plan.

公司评级、研究范围和相关定义 
买入、中性、卖出：分析师建议将评为买入或卖出的股票纳入地区投资名单。只股票在投资名单中评为买入或卖出由其相对于所属研究范围的总体潜在回
报决定。任何未获得买入或卖出评级且拥有活跃评级（即不属于暂停评级、暂无评级、暂停研究或没有研究的股票）的股票均被视为中性评级。每个地区
管理着地区强力买入名单，该名单选自各地区投资名单上评级为买入的股票，以总体潜在回报规模和/或实现回报的可能性为主要依据确立各自研究范围
内的投资建议。将股票加入或移出此类强力买入名单，由各地区的投资评估委员会或其他指定委员会进行管理，并不意味着分析师对这些股票的投资评级
发生了改变。 
总体潜在回报：代表当前股价低于或高于一定时间范围内预测目标价格的幅度，包括所有已付或预期股息。分析师被要求对研究范围内的所有股票给出目
标价格。总体潜在回报、目标价格及相关时间范围在每份加入投资名单或重申维持在投资名单的研究报告中都有注明。

当该公司是一家处于初期阶段的生物科技公司时，并在某些其他情况下，投资评级、目标价格和盈利预测（如相关）根据高盛的政策未予提供或已经予以
暂停。 暂停评级(RS)：由于缺乏足够的基础去确定投资评级或价格目标，我们已经暂停对这种股票给予投资评级和目标价格。此前对这种股票作出的投
资评级和目标价格(如有的话)将不再有效，因此投资者不应依赖该等资料。 暂停研究(CS)：我们已经暂停对该公司的研究。 没有研究(NC)：我们没有对
该公司进行研究。 不存在或不适用(NA)：此资料不存在或不适用。 无意义(NM)：此资料无意义，因此不包括在报告内。
