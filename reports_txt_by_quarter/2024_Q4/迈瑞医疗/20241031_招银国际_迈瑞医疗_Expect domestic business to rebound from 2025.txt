Mindray (300760 CH) 
 
 
 
Expect domestic business to rebound from 
2025 
 
Mindray reported 9M24 revenue of RMB29.5bn, up by 8.0% YoY. Attributable net 
profit increased by 8.2% YoY to RMB10.6bn. Revenue in 3Q24 grew by 1.4% 
YoY to RMB9.0bn while attributable net profit decreased by 9.3% YoY to 
RMB3.1bn. The slowdown in revenue growth can primarily be attributed to 
lackluster procurement activities in domestic public hospitals and weakened 
demand for IVD testing, particularly in lower-tier hospitals. Consequently, 
Mindray's domestic revenue fell by 9.7% YoY in 3Q24. Additionally, GPM in 3Q24 
decreased by 4.8pcts QoQ due to updates in accounting guidelines.    
 Domestic market remained under pressure, although signs of recovery 
in procurement are emerging. 1) IVD: Domestic revenue grew by 17% YoY 
in 9M24. Nationwide DRG implementation had a negative impact on the 
diagnosis demand in lower-tier hospitals which were the main contributors to 
Mindray's domestic IVD revenue. To counter act this, Mindray actively 
expanded its IVD business into top hospitals through its TLA and IT solutions. 
We expect Mindray to install over 150 TLAs in 2024E. 2) MIS: Domestic 
revenue grew by over 10% YoY in 9M24 driven by the strong volume ramp-
up of ultra-high-end Resona A20 ultrasound system. 3) PMLS: Domestic 
revenue decreased by 28% YoY in 9M24. The decline was influenced by 
constrained 
hospital 
funding 
amid 
a 
challenging 
macroeconomic 
environment. However, with accelerated issuance of special bonds, and 
stronger government support to address local debt issues, we expect 
domestic equipment demand to recover in 2025E. 
 Healthy growth in overseas business. In 3Q24, Mindray’s overseas 
revenue increased by 18.6% YoY with strong performances in Europe (+29% 
YoY), APAC (+32% YoY) and LatAm (+25% YoY), although there was some 
weakness in the US market. Driven by breakthroughs in medium-to-large 
volume labs, Mindray’s overseas IVD revenue increased by 32% YoY in 
9M24, accounting for 28% of total overseas revenue. Mindray has 
accelerated its overseas localization efforts. As of 3Q24, Mindray launched 
local manufacturing in 9 countries, 8 of which are related to IVD. Additionally, 
emerging businesses such as minimally invasive surgery (+50+% YoY), AED 
(+50+% YoY) and animal medical (+30+% YoY) grew significantly in 9M24. 
These emerging businesses contributed over 10% to Mindray’s overseas 
revenue. We expect IVD and emerging businesses to become the primary 
growth drivers for Mindray’s overseas businesses. 
 Maintain BUY. We lowered our earnings forecasts with target price adjusted 
to RMB 328.81 (WACC: 9.3%, terminal growth rate: 3.0%).
