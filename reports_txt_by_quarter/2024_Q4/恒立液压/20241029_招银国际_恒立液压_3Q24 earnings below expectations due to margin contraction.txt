CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Jiangsu Hengli (601100 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q24 earnings below expectations due to 
margin contraction  
 
Hengli’s EBIT in 3Q24 dropped 6% YoY to RMB445mn, due to gross margin 
contraction of 1.9ppt YoY despite an 11% YoY increase in revenue. The margin 
contraction, which was due to lower utilisation rate based on our understanding, 
is slightly below our expectation. Reported net profit grew 6% YoY to 
RMB504mn, helped by increases in net finance income and other gains. We are 
still positive on Hengli over the medium term, as (1) revenue contribution from 
non-excavator components continues to increase; (2) electric cylinders, ball 
screws and linear motion will likely serve as new growth driver in 2025E. That 
said, we think the potential Trump presidency could be a risk in the near term, 
given the potential increase in tariff that might affect the upcoming exports from 
the new production base in Mexico to the US market. We therefore believe 
better entry points may emerge after the election. We have left our earnings 
forecast unchanged. Our TP is also unchanged at RMB64, based on 31x 2024E 
P/E (historical average). Maintain BUY.      
 Key highlights in 3Q24 results: Revenue in 3Q24 grew 11% YoY to 
RMB2.1bn. Gross margin contracted 1.9ppt YoY and 2.1ppt QoQ to 41%. 
Selling & distribution expense ratio was under good control (2.1%, -0.2ppt 
YoY), while administrative and R&D expense ratio increased 2.9ppt YoY to 
17%. In 9M24, net profit slightly increased 2% YoY to RMB1.79bn, 
accounting for 65% of our full-year forecast (run rate in 9M23: 70%).  
 Production plan in Oct: We understand that Hengli has scheduled a 
production volume of 42k units of hydraulic cylinders (for excavators) in Oct, 
down ~5% YoY. For non-standardized cylinders, the planned production in 
Oct is expected to drop ~10% YoY to 17k units, due to the high base effect. 
On the positive side, scheduled production volume of small-size 
pumps/valves has increased ~40%/~90% YoY in Oct.  
 Risk factors: (1) further weakness in the demand for hydraulic components 
for excavators; (2) slower-than-expected new business development; (3) 
potentially higher tariffs upon Trump presidency.
