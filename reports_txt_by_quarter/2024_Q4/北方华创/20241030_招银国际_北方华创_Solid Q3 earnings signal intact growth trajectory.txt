Naura Technology (002371 CH) 
 
 
 
Solid Q3 earnings signal intact growth trajectory  
 
Naura announced 3Q24 results. Q3 revenue was RMB8.0bn, up 30.1% YoY 
and 23.8% QoQ, driven by significant growth in semiconductor equipment sales 
(up 47.0% in 9M24). NP was RMB1.7bn, up 55.0% YoY and 1.7% QoQ. GPM 
was 42.3%, up 5.9ppts from 3Q23 but declined 5.1ppts sequentially, mainly due 
to 1) higher photovoltaic (PV) equipment sales that had a lower GPM and 2) 
seasonal fluctuations in gross margins of semiconductor equipment business. 
Overall, Q3 was a solid quarter with robust revenue and net profit growth. 
Maintain BUY, with TP adjusted to RMB426, reflecting 30x rollover 2025E 
P/E (vs. prev. 35.8x). 
 9M24 results showed Naura is on track with stellar growth. 9M24 
revenue grew 39.5% YoY, benefiting from continuously strong sales of 
domestic semiconductor equipment (up 47.0% YoY in 9M24) due to China’s 
semi localization trend. 2025E bookings remain a key focus for most 
investors but have not been announced yet (2024 bookings were 
announced in Jan, 2024). We maintain our sales growth forecasts for 
2024/25E at 39.7%/26.5% YoY. 
 Margin decreased 5.1ppts QoQ in 3Q24, a similar seasonality observed 
in 3Q23 (down 7.0ppts) in addition to a negative impact from increased PV 
equipment sales. We revise down our 2024/25E GPM forecast by 
1.3ppts/1.1ppts to reflect the seasonality trend in 2024/25E, but we expect 
GPM to continue its upward trend (43.7%/44.3%) in 2024/25E on a 
favourable product mix. We slightly lower our NP forecasts by 3%/4% in 
24/25E considering continued investments in R&D.  
 Maintain BUY with TP adjusted to RMB426, based on 30x rollover 
2025E P/E, close to its historical 2-year forward P/E. New TP also reflects 
1.0x PEG. Potential risks include 1) worsening China-US trade relations, 2) 
heightened geopolitical tensions, 3) slower-than-expected R&D.
