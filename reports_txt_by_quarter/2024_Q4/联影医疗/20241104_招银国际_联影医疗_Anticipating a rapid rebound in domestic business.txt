CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
United Imaging (688271 CH) 
 
 
 
Anticipating a rapid rebound in domestic 
business 
 
United Imaging’s 9M24 revenue declined by 6.4% YoY to RMB6,954mn, with 3Q24 
revenue down by 25.0% YoY to RMB1.6bn. This downturn was primarily due to a 
challenging domestic market environment, marked by stringent industry regulations 
and delays in equipment renewal projects. Attributable net profit in 9M24 decreased 
by 36.9% YoY to RMB671mn, with net profit margin falling by 4.7 ppts. Despite 
these near-term challenges, United Imaging maintained its R&D expenditures and 
actively pursued expansion in international markets, which impacted profitability in 
the third quarter. Looking forward, as the implementation of equipment renewal 
projects has gradually picked up pace, United Imaging's revenue and net profit 
margins are expected to significantly improve in 2025E, in our view. 
 Robust overseas growth momentum. In 9M24, United Imaging’s overseas 
revenue grew 36.5% YoY to RMB1,404mn, accounting for 20.2% (+6.35 ppts) 
of total revenue. This accelerated growth continued into the third quarter, with 
revenues increasing by 51.7% YoY to RMB471mn. Strong performances were 
noted across North America, the Asia-Pacific region, and emerging markets. As 
United Imaging continues to enhance its overseas localization and service 
capabilities, we believe it is poised to strengthen its global competitiveness, 
better navigate geopolitical challenges, and sustain rapid growth internationally. 
 Strong growth in recurring revenue. In 9M24, revenue from maintenance 
services increased by 27.3% YoY to RMB967mn, accounting for 13.9% (+3.7 
ppts) of the total revenue. With a global installed base now exceeding 31,000 
units, United Imaging's service revenue contribution remains lower compared 
to global industry leaders like GE Healthcare (32.9% in 2023) and Philips 
(27.7% in 2023). However, with the expanding installed base and an enhanced 
global service network, we expect United Imaging’s recurring revenue to 
continue its rapid increase, offering resilience against industry fluctuations. 
 Medical equipment renewal projects set to materialize. Mgmt. has noted 
that medical equipment renewal projects began implementation in early 
October, with multiple procurement activities underway. Additionally, some 
previously delayed equipment procurements, halted due to policy uncertainties, 
have now restarted. These developments lay the foundation for a recovery in 
United Imaging’s domestic business in 4Q24 and 2025. However, due to 
stringent industry regulations, the procurement process has become more 
protracted. The installation and revenue recognition timelines for large 
equipment are also relatively long. Consequently, the positive impact of this 
procurement rebound is expected to be primarily reflected in 2025, in our view. 
 Maintain BUY. We expect hospital procurement to recover from 2025 and we 
are optimistic about the Company's long-term growth potential driven by the 
continued import substitution and strengthened global competitiveness. 
Therefore, we revise up the terminal growth rate forecast from 3.0% to 4.0%. 
Based on a 9-year DCF model, we adjust the target price to RMB162.81 
(WACC: 8.3%, terminal growth rate: 4.0%).
