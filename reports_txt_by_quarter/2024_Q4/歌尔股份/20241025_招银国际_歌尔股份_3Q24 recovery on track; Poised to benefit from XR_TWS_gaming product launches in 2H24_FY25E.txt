Goertek (002241 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q24 recovery on track; Poised to benefit from 
XR/TWS/gaming product launches in 2H24/FY25E  
 
Goertek’s 3Q24 revenue/ net profit rose +2%/+138% YoY, exceeding previous 
market expectations. 3Q24 GPM lifted to 11.4% (-2.2 ppts QoQ/+1.2 ppts YoY), 
mainly due to improving efficiency and better scale effect. Looking into 
4Q24/FY25E, we expect Goertek’s earnings will continue to rebound given 
improving GPM YoY, prudent cost control and better AR/VR/gaming demand 
with multiple product launches from major VR/AR players. We raised FY24-26E 
EPS estimates by 0-6% to reflect 3Q24 results, better operating leverage and 
expense control. In the longer term, we believe Goertek is well-positioned to 
capture opportunities in AR/VR product cycle from players such as Meta, Sony, 
Google, Samsung and Huawei. Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB27.39, based 
on same 25x FY25E P/E.  
 3Q24 above expectations on better efficiency and cost controls. 3Q24 
revenue/ net profit rose +2%/+138% YoY, beating market expectations, 
mainly driven by higher utilization, efficiency improvement and prudent cost 
controls. We believe Goertek’s profitability recovery will continue into 4Q24E 
and we estimate 4Q revenue/net profit will grow 36.3%/166.7% YoY, 
benefiting from the launch of Meta Quest 3S, AirPods 4 Series and other 
ARVR products.   
 4Q24/2025 Outlook: Continued profitability recovery and sales growth 
from edge AI and wearable product launches. In addition to order recovery 
of AirPods (after share loss in last two years) and product cycle of AirPods 4, 
we think Meta’s Quest 3S and upcoming Sony PS5 Pro will boost revenue 
growth in 4Q24/1H25E. Overall, we expect Goertek’s net profit to grow 
164%/30% YoY in FY24/25E. 
 Maintain BUY. We think Goertek’s industry leadership and product 
roadmap in XR/acoustics/gaming segments will allow it to benefit from 
industry recovery and upcoming new XR/gaming console product cycle in 
FY24/25E. We lifted our FY25/26E EPS estimates by 6%/6% mainly for 
better wearable product revenue and operating efficiency. Our new TP of 
RMB27.39 is based on same 25x FY25E P/E. Maintain BUY. Upcoming 
catalysts include new XR/gaming product launches and continued margin 
recovery.

Our new TP of RMB27.39 is based on the same 25x FY25E P/E. Overall, we believe 
Goertek’s industry leadership and product roadmap in TWS/XR/ acoustics/gaming 
segments will allow the company to benefit from industry recovery and market share gains 
in FY24/25E. Upcoming catalysts include new XR product launches and continued margin 
recovery.
