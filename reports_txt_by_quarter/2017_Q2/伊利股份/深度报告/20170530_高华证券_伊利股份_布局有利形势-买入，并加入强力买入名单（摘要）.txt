证券研究报告
布局有利形势 - 买入，并加入强力买入名单（摘要） 
建议理由 
我们认为未来即将出现两方面明确的信号推动伊利估值向上重估：1) 公司在过去3
个月里加紧了推广，凭借主要高端产品扩大其市场领先地位。我们预计公司销售额
在经历了五个表现平平的季度后，将从2017 年二季度开始以接近两位数的速度同
比增长； 2) 2017 年下半年里，我们预计国内供应削减以及进口下降将推动原奶价
格进入上行周期。由于竞争相应放缓，我们认为2017 年伊利将能够降低其整体广
告促销开支率，抵消成本压力。因此我们目前预计2016-18 年营业利润和每股盈
利的年均复合增速分别为16%和9%。重申对该股的买入评级，并作为我们在该板
块的首选股而加入强力买入名单，12 个月目标价格为人民币22.9 元，隐含19%
的上行空间。 
推动因素 
1) 销售额从2017 年二季度开始加速增长：我们预计2017 年二/三季度销售额增速
为9%，而过去五个季度的增速处于+/-3%。推动销售额加速增长的主要因素在于
常温酸奶/高档常温奶进一步强劲增长以及液态奶最近促销力度加大。婴幼儿配方
奶业务也在逐步复苏。2) 控制广告促销开支以及2017 年下半年的原奶价格上行周
期将抵消毛利率压力：我们估测2017 年伊利的广告促销开支率将同比下降50 个
基点。考虑到国内供应削减（因为在当前奶价下，小规模奶农退出无利可图的生
产）以及进口下降（因为全球/中国奶价缺口收窄），我们认为2017 年下半年中国
原奶价格将复苏。在我们看来，这将缓解竞争压力并且下游领先企业将收益最大。
3) 收购并购：由于伊利将实现其2020 年人民币1000 亿元的销售目标，我们预计
收购并购将成为对公司未来两年增长愈发重要的来源。我们认为海外高端品牌/非
乳业业务可能成为潜在选项，从而令伊利当前的产品结构多元化。 
估值 
我们将2018-20 年每股盈利预测上调至多3%，并将12 个月目标价格从人民币
22.40 元上调至22.90 元，基于2018 年预期EV/GCI vs. CROCI/WACC（行业现
金回报倍数仍为0.9 倍）。我们的目标价格隐含20 倍的2018 年预期市盈率。 
主要风险 
液态奶销售放缓，毛利率下降，收购并购带来摊薄影响。

Faster sales from 2Q17; further market share gains 
Following five quarters of slower/flattish sales growth, we now expect acceleration to a high 
single-digit yoy rate from 2Q17 and sustained growth of 7-8% over the next two years. 
Continued liquid milk market share gains from best-selling products, increased promotional 
intensity and gradual recovery of the infant milk formula (IMF) market will be the main drivers of 
faster growth, in our view.

Increasing promotional activity to drive sales 
 
 
We have seen in the past few months that Yili has started to increase promotional intensity, 
especially in key product SKUs such as Satine, its premium UHT long-life product.  
The data we track from Carrefour supermarket in Shanghai indicate Yili has offered on average 
17% price discounts for Satine, vs. almost no price discount for Mengniu’s Milk Deluxe in 1Q17. 
The discount for Satine is larger than in 2H16 (-5% on average) but similar to 1H16’s level. We 
observe similar discounting for Yili’s UHT yogurt products as competition remains intense in that 
category.  
We believe this increased promotion level is consistent with the company’s strategy for 2017: to 
focus more on sales growth and target an 8% increase in organic sales for 2017. We expect Yili’s 
sales to start benefiting from this strategic move from 2Q17 and we see both leaders Yili and 
Mengniu gaining market share from the small regional players.

Premium UHT milk and yogurt are key growth drivers 
As illustrated in Exhibits 5 and 6, we expect UHT/chilled yogurt and premium UHT milk to 
contribute the most to Yili’s topline, driving the acceleration for 2017.  
We see the UHT yogurt market continuing to grow at a high-teens yoy rate in 2017 and look for 
Yili to extend its leadership with a 45% market share (vs less than 30% in 2015). We forecast that 
Yili’s Ambrosial drinkable yoghurt product will record Rmb10bn sales in 2017 (+40% yoy), driven 
by active marketing campaigns and more product package/taste SKUs.

New products: Yili has recently launched a new bottle-shaped package for Ambrosial. Also, 
earlier this year the company launched a premium chilled yogurt product Pureday, priced at 
Rmb9.2/110g. These products cater increasingly to urban consumers who are willing to pay extra 
for healthy and tasty products. New products contributed about 20% of sales in 2016 and Yili is 
targeting another 15-20% contribution from new products again in 2017.

IMF: gradual recovery in 2H17, expect 8% Yili IMF growth 
IMF industry sales turned downward yoy in 2016 on a 3% drop in ASP vs. a 2% rise in volume, 
but Nielsen data indicate a gradual recovery in 1Q17, with 5% growth from ASP and 2% from 
volume. With a more favorable demographic trend in 2017 (2016 newborns grew over 10% yoy), 
we expect stronger demand for stage 1-2 products in 2017. Further, we believe stringent 
regulations, for example on limiting the number of series/formulas per company, will favor larger 
companies going into 2H17. (Smaller companies typically will offer more series to attract 
consumers, and their formulas are also less likely to register  successfully.)  
Our latest price check of mom & baby stores and distributors still indicates a competitive industry 
for 1H17. However, with smaller brands continuing to exit the market, and with the first batch of 
registered brands (those for which formulas are registered with the China regulatory authorities) 
likely to be announced in 3Q17, we expect distributors will become more confident to take on 
inventory in 2H17.  
The latest Nielsen data show that Yili maintains a stable market share in offline channels (Exhibit 
10), and we expect 8% IMF sales growth in 2017 vs. a 15% decline in 2016.

Product mix, lower A&P ratio to offset gross margin pressure 
We believe the market may have concerns about margin pressure on Yili in 2017. In 1Q17, Yili’s 
GPM dropped by 400bps yoy due to rising packaging material costs, while recently added price 
promotions could also negatively impact GPM for the rest of year.  
However, we believe a better product mix and declining A&P ratio should largely offset 
the cost pressure. 
1) We expect steady 4-5% ASP growth from product mix over 2017-2018E (6.2% in 2016) 
on stronger growth in flagship products.  
2) We believe Yili will start to lower its A&P expenses ratio in 2017, in contrast to the sharp 
increase over the past three years. In 1Q Yili recorded 400bps yoy lower selling expenses and we 
expect the full-year SG&A ratio to come in 80bps lower, mainly driven by A&P spending restraint.  
Yili’s direct peer Mengniu has also commented at result briefings on containing A&P spending 
and expects a flattish ratio in 2017. 
3) Cost pressures more contained: The main rising cost for Yili is paper products, which 
account for less than 5% of total COGS in 2016. The major cost component, raw milk, is likely to 
stay at a flat level yoy for 2017 as a whole, in our view. In 1H17 we see a continued yoy decline in 
raw milk cost, while we expect a gradual increase starting from 2H17.   
Hence, we expect Yili’s gross margin minus selling expenses (i.e. OPM) to remain stable for full-
year 2017.

Improved balance of milk supply/demand in 2H17 likely to drive milk price uptrend and 
ease competition 
China milk production has continued to shrink since early 2016. The latest Mar-Apr 2017 data 
indicate milk supply fell back into negative territory after 1Q16’s increase (Exhibit 17). The decline 
has been driven by smaller farmers exiting production due to current milk prices not making profit 
for them. 
Although the China raw milk price has remained at a weak level over the past 3 months, we 
highlight that the gap between China and global milk prices has more or less disappeared (China 
landed cost basis) and hence we expect a continued decline in milk powder imports for the rest of 
2017. 
We now expect the China raw milk price to bottom out and recover gradually in 2H17. This should 
reflect balancing supply/demand and less competition/inventory dumping in the market in 2H17. 
We believe that industry leaders will benefit most from a recovery in the supply/demand 
balance given that an increase in cost will reduce the incentive of smaller players to maintain

M&A a long term growth engine: 2020 sales target Rmb100bn 
In its 1Q results briefing, Yili reiterated its 2020 sales target of Rmb100bn in 2017. This implies a 
roughly Rmb20bn gap versus our expectation for organic group sales of Rmb80bn in 2020E. 
Accordingly, we believe inorganic M&A will be an important path of growth over the next three 
years. Yili has taken a prudent approach to M&A in the past and recently canceled the proposed 
acquisition of Shengmu as both parties mutually agreed not to proceed. Going forward, we expect 
the premium, overseas brands could be Yili’s M&A priority, given it can complement Yili’s current 
product portfolio and extend the premium positioning. 
The media (including Bloomberg on May 10, 2017) has recently reported Yili’s intention to bid for 
US organic yogurt brand Stonyfield. While we don't take a view of the accuracy of these reports, 
we believe that Yili could potentially extend its market leadership if it were to introduce a US 
brand into China. We believe foreign premium brands have potential to be successful in China, 
given past precedents such as Meiji, Danone, and Mead Johnson. 
Sufficient cash: Yili had a net cash position of Rmb14bn as of end-2016, and we see it 
continuing to increase its cash position over the next few years, driven by a stable margin and 
limited capex needs. 
Exhibit 21: We expect Yili to deliver Rmb80bn organic 
sales by 2020

Best risk-reward among staples: 16% OP CAGR, 24% ROE, 17X P/E  
Reflecting sales acceleration and better margin outlook, we raise our 2018-20E EPS by up to 3%, 
and with this lift our 12-month target price to Rmb22.90, from Rmb22.40. Yili is now trading at 
18X 12m fwd P/E, lower than its 10-year historical average of 21X, even after 
outperforming the market (CSI300) since January 2016 by c.26%. We continue to value Yili using 
2018E EV/GCI vs CROCI/WACC, applying a 10% premium to reflect higher returns and growth 
profile. We believe cash returns have become an increasingly important factor for investors given 
slower growth in the dairy sector. Our 12-month target price implies a 2018E P/E of 20X, below its 
historical average of 21X, and offers return potential of 21%, highest in our sector coverage. We 
reiterate our Buy rating, adding the shares to our Conviction List as our top pick in 
the sector.

Key risks: Slower liquid milk sales, lower margin from rising cost 
and competition, dilutive M&A 
We see three key risks to our investment thesis, detailed below.  
Slower liquid milk sales: The company could see slower basic UHT milk and chilled yogurt 
growth from weaker-than-expected demand. More proactive attempts to gain market share by 
peers could also impact sales growth potential. 
Lower margin from rising cost and competition: Commodity costs including paper, sugar 
and milk costs could move adversely, affecting Yili’s margin. Also higher pricing competition from 
peers and import players could impact Yili’s GPM and result in higher A&P spending than we 
forecast. 
Dilutive M&A: Yili is currently seeking potential M&A opportunities. Depending on the price paid 
and/or performance of any potential acquisition, this could impact Yili’s high ROE or EPS.

投资摘要 
投资摘要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与其行业和市场相比较来评价该股的投资环境。所描述的四个主要指标包括增长、回报、估值倍数和波动性。增长、
回报和估值倍数都是运用数种方法综合计算而成，以确定该股在地区研究行业内所处的百分位排名。  
每项指标的准确计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法如下：  
增长是下一年预测与当前年度预测的综合比较，如每股盈利、EBITDA 和收入等。 回报是各项资本回报指标一年预测的加总，如CROCI、平均运用资本回报率
和净资产回报率。 估值倍数根据一年预期估值比率综合计算，如市盈率、股息收益率、EV/FCF、EV/EBITDA、EV/DACF、市净率。 波动性根据12 个月的历史
波动性计算并经股息调整。  
Quantum 
Quantum 是提供具体财务报表数据历史、预测和比率的高盛专有数据库，它可以用于对单一公司的深入分析，或在不同行业和市场的公司之间进行比较。  
GS SUSTAIN 
GS SUSTAIN 是侧重于长期做多建议的相对稳定的全球投资策略。GS SUSTAIN 关注名单涵盖了我们认为相对于全球同业具有持续竞争优势和出色的资本回
报、因而有望在长期内表现出色的行业领军企业。我们对领军企业的筛选基于对以下三方面的量化分析：现金投资的现金回报、行业地位和管理水平（公司管
理层对行业面临的环境、社会和企业治理方面管理的有效性）。

与公司有关的法定披露

公司评级、研究行业及评级和相关定义 
买入、中性、卖出：分析师建议将评为买入或卖出的股票纳入地区投资名单。一只股票在投资名单中评为买入或卖出由其相对于所属研究行业的总体潜在回报决
定。任何未获得买入或卖出评级且拥有活跃评级（即不属于暂停评级、暂无评级、暂停研究或没有研究的股票）的股票均被视为中性评级。每个地区投资评估
委员会根据25-35%的股票评级为买入、10-15%的股票评级为卖出的全球指导原则来管理该地区的投资名单；但是，在某一特定分析师所覆盖行业中买入和卖
出评级的分布可能根据地区投资评估委员会的决定而有所不同。此外，每个地区投资评估委员会管理着地区强力买入或卖出名单，该名单以总体潜在回报规模
和/或实现回报的可能性为主要依据确立各自研究范围内的投资建议。将股票加入或移出此类强力买入或卖出名单并不意味着分析师对这些股票的投资评级发生
了改变。 
总体潜在回报：代表当前股价低于或高于一定时间范围内预测目标价格的幅度，包括所有已付或预期股息。分析师被要求对研究范围内的所有股票给出目标价
格。总体潜在回报、目标价格及相关时间范围在每份加入投资名单或重申维持在投资名单的研究报告中都有注明。 
研究行业及评级：每个行业研究的所有股票名单可登陆http://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html 通过主要分析师、股票和行业进行查询。分析师给出下列评级中
的其中一项代表其根据行业历史基本面及／或估值对研究对象的投资前景的看法。 具吸引力(A)：未来12 个月内投资前景优于研究范围的历史基本面及／或估
值。 中性(N)：未来12 个月内投资前景相对研究范围的历史基本面及／或估值持平。 谨慎(C)：未来12 个月内投资前景劣于研究范围的历史基本面及／或估
值。  
暂无评级(NR)：在高盛于涉及该公司的一项合并交易或战略性交易中担任咨询顾问时并在某些其他情况下，投资评级和目标价格已经根据高盛的政策予以除去。 
暂停评级(RS)：由于缺乏足够的基础去确定投资评级或价格目标，或在发表报告方面存在法律、监管或政策的限制，我们已经暂停对这种股票给予投资评级和价
格目标。此前对这种股票作出的投资评级和价格目标(如有的话)将不再有效，因此投资者不应依赖该等资料。 暂停研究(CS)：我们已经暂停对该公司的研究。 
没有研究(NC)：我们没有对该公司进行研究。 不存在或不适用(NA)：此资料不存在或不适用。 无意义(NM)：此资料无意义，因此不包括在报告内。
