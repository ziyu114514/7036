证券研究报告
老窖重焕生机，上调评级至买入（摘要） 
建议理由 
我们认为泸州老窖（在中国拥有市场份额排名第三的高端品牌 ）将受益于高端白
酒市场的强劲复苏。此外，我们认为公司于2015 年实施的改革在经历了2015-16
年的稳定/调整期后开始收效。我们将2017-21 年预测上调了至多19%，以体现下
列因素：(1) 高端及中端产品强劲反弹，原因在于渠道改革令公司重振品牌实力；
(2) 产品结构升级带来利润率扩张。基于我们新的12 个月目标价格人民币55.06 元
存在10%的上行空间，我们将泸州老窖评级由中性上调至买入。 
 
推动因素 
 
泸州老窖的高端品牌——国窖1573 的一批价上涨。目前国窖1573 的一批价
为每瓶人民币680 元，进一步接近出厂价，我们估测公司为经销商提供约
10%的销售返点。考虑到2017 年下半年贵州茅台供需格局将比较紧张，而且
五粮液一批价上涨，国窖1573 的一批价也有可能上涨。如果公司减少销售返
点，那么我们预计销售费用将会下降，从而提振盈利。 
 
泸州老窖的母公司允许其实施国企改革、股权激励计划以及兼并收购。我们认
为潜在的国企改革可能对公司有利，因为管理层和公司的利益将更好地结合起
来。 
估值 
我们认为当前估值具吸引力，该股股价对应27 倍的2017 年预期市盈率，而2016-
18 年预期每股盈利的年均复合增速为31%（该板块对应26 倍的2017 年市盈率，
而2016-18 年预期每股盈利的年均复合增速为23%）。我们的12 个月目标价格为
人民币55.06 元（原为46.17 元），仍基于20 倍的市盈率乘以2021 年每股盈利
预测，并以8.7%的行业股权成本贴现回2017 年。 
主要风险 
高端/中端产品收入的复苏不及预期；消费税率提高。

Overview: Buy on high-end spirit upcycle and company reforms 
Rising from the trough 
Luzhou Laojiao is one of the oldest spirit brands in China, dating back to the Ming Dynasty. It was 
one of the top 3 spirit companies in China in terms of net profit until 2012. The company faced a 
challenging time during 2013-14 when its revenue declined 54% from Rmb11.5bn in 2012 to 
Rmb5.35bn in 2014, while net profit declined 80% from Rmb4.39bn in 2012 to Rmb880mn in 
2014. Although the sector corrected due to the government’s anti-corruption measures, the 
company declined more than its peers due to some strategic mistakes in pricing and sales 
channels.  
However, with the new management stepping up in 1H15 and carrying out reforms, the company 
gradually recovered in 2015-16 with revenue/net profit back to Rmb8.3bn/1.928bn in 2016, closer 
to the historical peak in 2011. With momentum building up and reform continuing to take effect, 
the new management has set a new target of getting back to the industry top 3 before 2020, and 
has started to accelerate revenue growth in 2017 after the stabilizing/adjustment period during 
2015-16.  
Well positioned amid a high-end spirit upcycle 
We think the company is well positioned amid a rising cycle of high-end spirit growth. The No. 1 
brand by market share, Kweichow Moutai, continues to have limited supply and rising prices, 
which should benefit followers such as Wuliangye and Guojiao 1573 (owned by Luzhou laojiao). 
We expect faster revenue growth with the new management continuing to focus on 5 super 
brands (Guojiao 1573, Jiaoling, Tequ, Touqu & Erqu), sales channel expansion and bolstering 
price. We raise our 2017-21E estimates by up to 19% to reflect: 
(1) a strong rebound in high-end and mid-end products, with channel reform reviving Laojiao’s 
brand strength (23%/22% revenue CAGR in 2016-21E for high-end / mid-end by our estimate); 
(2) product mix shift upgrade leading to margin expansion. We expect faster growth of high-end 
and mid-end products to bring c.1ppt margin expansion annually.  
Valuation attractive, strong catalysts 
Our 12-month target price of Rmb55.06 (was 46.17) is still based on 20X PE applied to 2021E 
EPS and discounted back to 2017E using 8.7% sector COE. We consider current valuation 
attractive with the stock trading at 27X 2017E PE with 31% 16-18E EPS CAGR (vs. sector at 26X 
2017E PE with 23% 16-18E EPS CAGR). We see the following two catalysts: 
(1) Rising wholesale price of Guojiao 1573, Laojiao’s high-end brand. Current wholesale price of 
Guojiao 1573 is Rmb680/bottle, closer to ex-factory price and we estimate that the company 
gives about 10% rebate to distributors. Given Moutai will be in a tight balance in 2H17 and 
Wuliangye’s wholesale price is rising, Guojiao 1573 might follow suit. We expect sales expenses 
to decline should the company cut rebates, thus bolstering earnings. 
(2)  Laojiao’s parent company has empowered it to conduct SOE reform, stock incentive plan and 
M&A. We think potential mixed ownership reform could benefit Laojiao with management interest 
getting better aligned with that of the company. 
Key risks 
Lower-than-expected recovery of high-end / mid-end revenue: Our thesis hinges upon a 
recovery of high-end and mid-end spirit segments; if that falls below expectation, it could be a 
potential risk 
Consumption tax rate hike: Laojiao’s consumption tax rate was only 10% in 2016, lower than 
Moutai’s 14%. If local government becomes stricter in consumption tax, it could pose a risk to 
earnings.

Strong recovery aided by reforms 
Reform measures taking effect  
Because of some strategic mistakes in pricing and marketing, Laojiao’s revenues declined 
10%/49% in 2013/2014 during the industry down cycle, and net income declined 22%/74%.  
In June 2015, Luzhou Laojiao appointed its new Chairman, Miao Liu, and new President, Feng 
Lin. Shortly after coming on board, the new management team embarked on a series of reforms, 
aimed at bringing the company back to growth after two years of deep recession in 2013-2015. 
Reform measures launched by the new management include  Super Brand strategy to focus on 
five key brands, tightening supply to bolster price, and channel reforms.  
Super Brand strategy 
Before 2015, Luzhou Laojiao had about 3000 SKUs, including many licensed brands. 
Manufacturers of these licensed brands produced and marketed on their own, and then attached 
to a “Luzhou Laojiao” brand package. Hence, brand management was chaotic and different 
brands cannibalized each other. The Super Brand strategy aimed to cut the number of brands 
and identified five key brands to focus on: Guojiao 1573 as a high-end brand, Jiaoling and Tequ 
as mid-end brands, and Touqu & Erqu as low-end brands. 
Exhibit 1: Five key brands in the Super Brand strategy 
 
Source: Company data, JD.com 
To effectively manage the company’s brands and cut redundant brands, the company has cut 
brands with ex-factory price below Rmb20 and stopped providing packages with “Luzhou Laojiao” 
brand to manufacturers of these brands. As of year-end 2016, the company had cut its SKUs 
from 3000 to about 400-500. 
On 19 Sep 2016, the company announced a change in its product management model: all 
licensed manufacturers have to purchase spirit from Luzhou Laojiao; Luzhou Laojiao will monitor 
and manage their manufacture process; and all products have to be detected at designated 
detecting platforms.  
We think these reforms will help Luzhou Laojiao effectively manage its brands. First, quality of 
spirit is guaranteed, which is conducive to protecting brand image of the company and is good for 
long-term development. Second, the company supplies all the spirits so that licensed

manufactures have less incentive to sell at very low prices since their cost is fixed. Price system 
thus becomes more stable. Third, distributors of the five key brands worry less about low-priced 
products spoiling the market. With more confidence in Luzhou Laojiao brand, they have more 
incentive to sell the company’s products. 
Tightening supply to bolster price 
In June 2015, management announced that the company will temporarily stop supplying Jiaoling 
spirit to tackle the chaotic pricing in the market. In June 2016, the company temporarily 
suspended supply of Guojiao 1573, to clear channel inventory and bolster price. In Sep 2016, the 
company stipulated that distributors of Guojiao 1573 in Sichuan Province should order based on 
actual needs. Supply is tightened to ensure price stability. In Mar 2017, ex-factory price of 
Guojiao 1573 was raised from Rmb620 to Rmb680. 
We think these supply tightening measures, that came after revenue growth rebounded from 
2015, reflect the company’s confidence in its brand strength. A stable and clear price system is 
helpful in protecting brand image and supporting long-term development.

Channel reform: Shifting to brand operating model 
Before 2015, the company employed a “Qiquan” channel model. Qiquan companies are 
established by regions and owned by key regional distributors. Qiquan companies procure 
different products from Luzhou Laojiao and then sell to distributors.  
The new management of Luzhou Laojiao decided that this channel model is not consistent with its 
Super Brand strategy, and is gradually shifting to a brand operating model. In the new model, 
three brand operating companies are established to be responsible for high-end to low-end 
products. For example, Guojiao Brand Operating Company is responsible for managing sales and 
distribution of Guojiao 1573, Jiaoling Brand Operating Company is responsible for Jiaoling series 
products, and Tequ Brand Operating Company manages Tequ products. Boda company is a 75% 
owned subsidiary of Laojiao established in 2008, responsible for managing the company’s low-
end products like Touqu and Erqu. Each brand operating company would then have regional 
subsidiaries, like Sichuan provincial subsidiary and Hunan provincial subsidiary, who then sell 
their respective products to distributors. 

Exhibit 5: Three brand operating companies + Boda Company and their products 
 
Source: Company data 
We think the new brand operating model is conducive to implementing the Super Brand strategy 
because: (1) each brand operating company operates relatively independently, and can optimize 
its strategy for respective brands in terms of pricing, marketing and brand advertising strategies; 
(2) key distributors have ownership of brand operating companies and are incentivized to 
maximize their efforts; (3) compared with the old “Qiquan” model, tiers of distributors are reduced 
to only one, and Luzhou Laojiao has better control over channel and terminals.  
Exhibit 6: Brand operating model has advantages over “Qiquan” model 
Comparison between brand operating model and Qiquan model 
 
Source: Company data 
In order to better incentivize distributors, Luzhou Laojiao has always emphasized on channel 
profit margin. For Guojiao 1573, the company aims to maintain a higher channel profit than 
competitor product Wuliangye. For Jiaoling products, the company aims to maintain 1.5 times 
channel profit than competitor products. 
In order to better control terminals, Luzhou Laojiao has increased the number of salespeople in 
the brand operating companies from 1200 in the beginning of 2015 to more than 8000 now. There 
are several advantages of enhancing sales team: (1) the company can have more timely 
feedback of sales, including changes of consumer preferences and market conditions, so that the 
company can react more quickly to market changes; (2) the company has better control over 
sales volume and price.  
An increased sales force usually costs more. However, unlike peers, most of the salespeople are 
in brand operating companies, who are in charge of their salary.

Improved operating results on the back of reforms 
Laojiao’s operating results show that the company’s reforms since June 2015 have been quite 
effective. Quarterly revenue and net income has increased yoy since 3Q15. 
For high-end product Guojiao 1573, sales volume reached 1,462 / 2,778 tons in 2015 / 2016, up 
95% / 90% yoy according to our estimate. For mid-end products, Jiaoling sales volume increased 
24%; Tequ sales volume increased 77% in 2016 according to our estimate. 
Overall, we think Luzhou Laojiao’s growth momentum has restored, which reflects the impact of 
the reform measures implemented by the new management, and the company is developing on a 
good track.

Guojiao 1573, the flagship brand of Luzhou Laojiao 
Brand history 
Guojiao 1573 is the high-end brand of Luzhou Laojiao. “Jiao” refers to a cellar, where spirits 
ferment. While western liquor ferments in oak barrels, Chinese spirit ferments in cellars. The more 
aged spirit cellars are, the better spirit they produce. 1573 refers to the company’s cellars that 
were built in year 1573, at the time of the Ming dynasty. “Guo” means national, and refers to the 
above mentioned cellars being awarded as the “first cellar in China” by the industry in 1996. The 
first batch of Guojiao 1573 products were launched in 2001. 
Market position 
Guojiao 1573 is one of the few players in the high-end spirit market in China. In 2011, its retail 
price was even Rmb250 higher than Wuliangye. However, during the industry down cycle in 
2013/14, management hiked ex-factory price by Rmb110/bottle in Aug 2013, while Moutai and 
Wuliangye maintained their ex-factory prices. This resulted in sales volume of Guojiao 1573 
declining 30% in 2013 and 65% in 2014. The company was forced to cut ex-factory price in June 
2014 by Rmb319/bottle and by a further Rmb130/bottle in Aug 2014, to Rmb560/bottle. Guojiao 
1573’s market share dropped from 7% in 2012 to 2% in 2014. 
However, the price cut didn’t diminish the quality of the spirit. With the recovery of the high-end 
spirit market from late 2015, prices of Moutai and Wuliangye have been increasing, making 
Guojiao 1573 more attractive. In 2015 and 2016, revenue of Guojiao 1573 increased 72% / 89% 
yoy, showing strong demand and consumer faith in the quality and branding of Guojiao 1573. 
Because the cellars used to produce Guojiao 1573 cannot be replicated in a short time, 
production capacity of Guojiao 1573 is limited to about 3000 tons of base spirit and 5000-6000 
tons of end product, much less than Moutai (40k tons) and Wuliangye (16k tons), and 
demonstrates the scarcity of Guojiao 1573. In 2016, Guojiao 1573’s market share in high-end 
spirit was 4.6%. We expect it to increase to 5% in 2017 driven by the strong rebound in volumes, 
which might surpass the peak volume in 2011.  
We think the company is well positioned amid the high-end spirit upcyle with the industry’s No. 1 
brand in terms of market share, Kweichow Moutai, continuing to have limited supply and raising 
prices, benefiting lower-tier brands such as Wuliangye and Guojiao 1573 (owned by Luzhou 
laojiao). With reform effect continuing to manifest, we think Laojiao’s sales volume might further 
double to over 6,000 tons in the next five years, representing 19% CAGR during 2016-21E. In 
terms of pricing, the ex-factory price hike in Mar 2017 will likely bring c. 6%/5% ASP rise in 
2017/18. Apart from this, we have not factored in further price hikes and expect ASP to be largely 
stable in the next couple of years. As a result, we forecast robust revenue growth in the next five 
years for Guojiao 1573 (23% CAGR in 2016-21E) and moderate GP margin expansion on the 
back of product mix upgrade.

Jiaoling & Tequ, super brands to tap the mid-end market 
Among the different price segments of the spirit market, we think the mid-end market has the 
most upside potential in the next five years, mainly driven by consumption upgrade of the mass 
population from low-end to mid-end. We think Jiaoling & Tequ, with a price range of Rmb150-400, 
are powerful brands to tap the promising mid-end spirit market.

Jiaoling: Product mix shifting up 
The Jiaoling series has three products, aged 30/60/90 years, with retail price of about 
Rmb200/250/400. The company positions its Jiaoling series products as mid-end and upper mid-
end spirits good for corporate gifting. In 2015, the company invited three famous hosts to 
advocate for Jiaoling products. These well-known and respected hosts helped shape Jiaoling 
spirit’s brand image as a spirit for smart and experienced business people.  
Currently Jiaoling 30 years still contributes to majority of sales, but the product mix has started to 
shift towards the higher end. In 1H16, 30 years Jiaoling accounted for 59% of sales, down from 
80% in 2015. Going forward, management hopes to further increase the contribution of 60 and 90 
years, so as to differentiate Jiaoling from Tequ, which sells at about Rmb170.  
For sales channel, the company established Jiaoling Brand Operating Company to better manage 
brand resources. The number of salespeople has increased to about 800 from 200 in 2015, which 
we believe ensures better control over marketing effectiveness and channel penetration. 
We estimate the ex-factory price of Jiaoling kept rising in 2015 and 2016, thanks to product mix 
shift and management’s measures to tighten supply and clear channel inventory. In future, we 
expect further ASP increase due to product mix change, and 20% volume CAGR in 2016-21E.

Tequ: Super brand targeting to reach Rmb10bn of sales in 10 years 
Market pricing of Tequ used to be chaotic and in some areas the product sold at very low prices. 
In line with the strategy to bolster product pricing, the company raised ex-factory price of 
Laozihao Tequ by Rmb20/bottle, or about 10% in Dec 2015. The company further suspended 
supply of Tequ in Jan 2016. Thanks to tightened supply and price hike, price of Tequ has restored 
to its previous height in 2013, according to our estimate.  
Tequ is positioned to tap the mid-end business and private entertainment demand. Management 
lays strategic importance on Tequ and hopes to develop it into a super brand with Rmb10bn in 
sales in 10 years (from about Rmb1.2bn in 2016). 
We estimate steady revenue growth for Tequ in the next five years, driven by a volume CAGR of 
20% and stable ASP.  
Overall, we expect Laojiao’s mid-end products to see 22% revenue CAGR in 2016-20, faster than 
the overall growth in mid-end spirits.

Touqu & Erqu to compete in the low-end market 
Luzhou Laojiao established Boda Company in 2008 to be responsible for low-end products. Its 
key products include Touqu and Erqu. As a relatively independent operating subsidiary, Boda 
Company developed rapidly until 2013, but slowed down in recent years due to the overall 
slowdown in the spirit industry. Echoing Luzhou Laojiao’s new Super Brand strategy, Boda 
Company has made a series of reforms: 
(1) Cutting peripheral SKU. Apart from Touqu and Erqu, the company still has many other low-
end SKUs, which account for about Rmb1bn revenue in 2015. The company hopes to gradually 
reduce these peripheral SKUs and focus more on core Super Brands like Touqu and Erqu. 
(2) Brand positioning to tap different needs. Going forward, Boda Company aims to have a 
clearer brand positioning for its core brands. For example, Jingpin Touqu would focus on 
business consumption, Lao Touqu would focus on family feast, and Erqu would position itself as a 
fast-moving consumer brand. We think the clear positioning of brands would minimize brand 
cannibalization and is consistent with the overall Super Brand strategy of Luzhou Laojiao. 
(3) Focus on county level channels. In Luzhou Laojiao’s product positioning, Touqu is 
positioned as a “county spirit” and Erqu positioned as “village spirit”. In order to better penetrate 
county and village level channels, Boda Company has strengthened its sales team and now has 
better control over distributors and terminals. 
(4) Active marketing. For low-end mass market products, it’s very hard to raise price 
significantly. Hence, volume increase is the most important driver. However, given spirit is already 
well penetrated and we don’t see overall consumption volume increasing much in future years, 
competition will likely intensify. Management has also explicitly said that Boda Company will 
compete directly with peers to gain market share. In order to win the war of mass market spirit, 
Boda Company has intensified marketing efforts, including recruiting more salespeople, having 
tighter control over distributors and achieving greater influence on consumers. 
Currently the mid-to-low end market is still very fragmented. Luzhou Laojiao’s mid-end plus low-
end products only account for 1% market share in 2015. As competition is fierce, we think 
products with strong branding are more likely to stand out, which gives Luzhou Laojiao’s low end 
products a better position.  
In 2016, Luzhou Laojiao’s revenue from low-end products declined 31%, mainly because of 
clearing of peripheral and licensed brands. As of now, this process has almost come to an end 
and we estimate volume of the company’s low-end product will increase at 4% CAGR in 2017-21 
while ASP will likely remain stable.

Earnings estimates and valuation 
We raise our 2017-21E estimates by 2-19% to reflect higher volumes on both mid-end and high-
end brands and margin expansion driven by product mix upgrade. Our 12-month TP of Rmb55.06 
(was 46.17) is still based on 20X PE applied to 2021E EPS and discounted back to 2017E using 
8.7% sector COE. 
Our current estimate do not factor in any further price hikes after the recent 10% hike of Guojiao 
1573 in March 2017. However, with the rising price of peers such as Wuliangye, we think a price 
hike might be possible in 2018. We thus conduct a scenario analysis on a potential price hike 
situation. Our analysis suggests that a price hike could be a strong value driver. A 10% price hike 
for its mid-end and high-end brands in 2018 would drive net profit/valuation 20%/19% higher 
according to our sensitivity analysis.

公司评级、研究行业及评级和相关定义 
买入、中性、卖出：分析师建议将评为买入或卖出的股票纳入地区投资名单。一只股票在投资名单中评为买入或卖出由其相对于所属研究行业的总体潜在回报决
定。任何未获得买入或卖出评级且拥有活跃评级（即不属于暂停评级、暂无评级、暂停研究或没有研究的股票）的股票均被视为中性评级。每个地区投资评估
委员会根据25-35%的股票评级为买入、10-15%的股票评级为卖出的全球指导原则来管理该地区的投资名单；但是，在某一特定分析师所覆盖行业中买入和卖
出评级的分布可能根据地区投资评估委员会的决定而有所不同。此外，每个地区投资评估委员会管理着地区强力买入或卖出名单，该名单以总体潜在回报规模
和/或实现回报的可能性为主要依据确立各自研究范围内的投资建议。将股票加入或移出此类强力买入或卖出名单并不意味着分析师对这些股票的投资评级发生
了改变。 
总体潜在回报：代表当前股价低于或高于一定时间范围内预测目标价格的幅度，包括所有已付或预期股息。分析师被要求对研究范围内的所有股票给出目标价
格。总体潜在回报、目标价格及相关时间范围在每份加入投资名单或重申维持在投资名单的研究报告中都有注明。 
研究行业及评级：每个行业研究的所有股票名单可登陆http://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html 通过主要分析师、股票和行业进行查询。分析师给出下列评级中
的其中一项代表其根据行业历史基本面及／或估值对研究对象的投资前景的看法。 具吸引力(A)：未来12 个月内投资前景优于研究范围的历史基本面及／或估
值。 中性(N)：未来12 个月内投资前景相对研究范围的历史基本面及／或估值持平。 谨慎(C)：未来12 个月内投资前景劣于研究范围的历史基本面及／或估
值。  
暂无评级(NR)：在高盛于涉及该公司的一项合并交易或战略性交易中担任咨询顾问时并在某些其他情况下，投资评级和目标价格已经根据高盛的政策予以除去。 
暂停评级(RS)：由于缺乏足够的基础去确定投资评级或价格目标，或在发表报告方面存在法律、监管或政策的限制，我们已经暂停对这种股票给予投资评级和价
格目标。此前对这种股票作出的投资评级和价格目标(如有的话)将不再有效，因此投资者不应依赖该等资料。 暂停研究(CS)：我们已经暂停对该公司的研究。 
没有研究(NC)：我们没有对该公司进行研究。 不存在或不适用(NA)：此资料不存在或不适用。 无意义(NM)：此资料无意义，因此不包括在报告内。
