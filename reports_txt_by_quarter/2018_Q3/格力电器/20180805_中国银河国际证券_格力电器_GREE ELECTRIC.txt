GREE ELECTRIC [000651.CH] 
Gree is benefitting from recent strong domestic demand for air conditioning, 
and we expect the Company to report a strong performance for 2018H1. 
Recent RMB weakness also benefits Gree. We remain cautious on Gree, 
however, due low visibility on AC sales in 2018H2, its single-product, single-
market focus, the lack of new discernible earnings drivers, and an 
inconsistent growth strategy. 
 Investment Highlights 
Anticipating strong 2018H1 performance. Due to hot weather, lean 
inventory levels, and a resilient property market, all AC manufacturers in 
China are seeing strong sales growth. Gree is guiding revenue of RMB 
200bn in 2018 versus consensus estimates of ~RMB 177bn. We expect 
Gree to achieve sales of ~RMB95bn in 2018H1, or 34% YoY growth. 
Trade war concerns overblown. We estimate that 20% of Gree’s exports, 
or ~RMB3bn in 2017, were exported to the United States. This is equivalent 
to ~2% of Gree’s total sales in 2017. 
USD holdings to result in currency gains. As of Dec. 2017, Gree held 
~US$6.5bn in cash, against ~US$1.5bn in debt. We estimate that 5% RMB 
depreciation since Dec. 2017 will result in a translation gain of ~RMB1.8bn 
before tax, or a 6% increase in Gree’s 2018E PBT. However, this is a one-
off gain which should not result in a re-rating of the stock. 
Gree’s exports will benefit from USD strength. While the 2018H1 results 
should have been negatively affected by the relatively strong RMB in most of 
2018H1, recent RMB exchange rate fluctuations should have an impact in 
2018H2. We estimate that 5% RMB depreciation will increase Gree’s 
2018H2 PBT by ~RMB200m, or ~0.7% of 2018E’s PBT. The impact should 
be greater in 2019. 
Fair Valuation. Gree is on track for solid revenue growth in 2018H1, and its 
low valuation, coupled with an interim dividend announcement, may result in 
near-term outperformance. Although the Company may benefit from RMB 
weakness, the impact is not sufficiently large to justify a re-rating. In spite of 
a strong 2018H1 top line, we remain cautious about 2018H2 in light of low 
visibility on AC sales, the lack of new discernible long-term growth drivers, 
and an inconsistent corporate strategy. We believe Gree warrants a discount 
relative to its peers Haier and Midea and value the Company at 9.5x 2019 
earnings, implying a 12-month target price of RMB48, or ~8.5% upside.

Impact of Gree’s USD Holdings 
As of Dec. 2017, Gree held ~US$46.5bn in cash against ~US$1.5bn in debt. The net USD position was 
reported as the equivalent of RMB35.4bn. Changes in the USD/RMB exchange rate will create 
translation gains/losses that will accrue to net profit. We estimate that 5% RMB depreciation since Dec. 
2017 will result in a translation gain of ~RMB1.8bn before tax, or a 6% increase in Gree’s 2018E PBT 
(Figure 1).

Exports to Benefit from RMB Depreciation 
In 2017, Gree booked RMB18.4bn out of RMB150bn in sales to international markets. We 
understand that Gree currently operates one manufacturing plant outside of China. On this basis, we 
estimate the majority of Gree’s total international sales are exports originating from mainland China. 
Theoretically, the appreciation of the USD for exports may result in higher revenues while overall 
RMB-based costs remain stable. 
The benefits accruing to Gree from export revenue will be adjusted since (i) only ~20% of Gree’s 
exports are to the U.S. market. So while the majority of Gree’s exports are priced in USD, local 
currency depreciation in end markets may limit Gree’s ability to hold fixed prices in USD, and (ii) 
currency fluctuation in the past two months will mainly affect sales in 2018H2 and 2019. 
We sought to ascertain Gree’s higher profitability from RMB depreciation. Based on our estimates, 
we see RMB depreciation of 5% from Dec. 2017 levels benefiting Gree’s PBT by ~RMB 200m in 
2018H2, or ~0.7% of 2018E’s PBT. The impact on 2019 will be greater due to the full-year impact.
