Gree [000651.CH]: Potential slowdown in 2H18 
Gree reported a strong set of interim results, with revenue and EPS growing by 
31.4% and 34.2% respectively, led by strong results in air conditioning. At present, 
investor concern is focused on deteriorating China AC sales growth in July / August. 
We believe top line concerns are likely to pressure the stock into 2H18, and we trim 
our 2018 / 2019 EPS estimates by 5.7% / 11.4% and reduce our target price from 
RMB 48 to RMB 42.6 to account for softening top line growth. 
 Investment Highlights 
Strong 1H18 growth, but weaker margins: Gree’s AC segment, which comprised 
~80% of total sales, grew 38.8% YoY. Gree indicated that sales growth was faster in 
Tier 3/4 cities for the period. In spite of strong top line growth, gross margins in the 
AC segment contracted 410bps on account of increased raw materials prices and 
low utilization at a new Changsha factory. Gree negated the impact of gross margin 
compression and by cutting selling expense by 350bps to 8.7%, a historical low, 
which may prove unsustainable in our view. 
AC growth decelerating in 2H18: Midea, Gree, and Qingdao Haier all experienced 
negative growth in AC sales in July due to high base effect and weather. We 
understand Gree experienced singled digit negative volume/sales growth in July due 
to high base and weather effect. In August, negative growth has moderated to 
approximately flat growth YoY. This trend is consistent with our channel checks and 
reporting from other home appliance manufacturers. 
Dividend disappoints: Gree announced a proposed interim dividend of RMB3.6bn, 
indicating ~30% payout ratio for 1H18. This is less than our and market expectations 
of ~50% payout, and below Gree’s historical payout ratio of ~60-70%. Gree has not 
provided clear guidance on whether it still intends to pay a delayed dividend on 
2017’s earnings. Gree has also not provided further clarity on where it intends to 
invest its cash reserves. 
Inventory levels under control: Gree’s factory and channel inventory remain 
seasonally low, according to the Company. Similarly, channel inventory levels of 
industry competitors also remain well controlled.  
Inexpensive valuation. In spite of a strong 2018H1 top line, we remain cautious 
about Gree’s 2018H2 in light of low visibility on AC sales, the lack of new discernible 
long-term growth drivers, and an inconsistent corporate strategy. Gree derives ~88% 
of its revenue from China, making its earnings almost wholly reliant on the domestic 
China market. On this basis, we believe Gree warrants a discount relative to its peers 
Haier and Midea. We cut our 2018/2019 EPS estimates by 5.7%/11.4% and value 
the Company at 9.5x PER, implying a 12-month target price of RMB42.6, or ~9% 
upside.
