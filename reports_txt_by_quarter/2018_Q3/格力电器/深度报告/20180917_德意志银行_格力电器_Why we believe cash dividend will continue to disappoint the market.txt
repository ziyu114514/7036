Why we believe cash dividend will
continue to disappoint the market
Distributors' liquidity likely at critical level; cut DPS forecasts to below
consensus
A common belief by investors is that Gree will eventually increase the cash
dividend payout, to gradually distribute the signiﬁcant net cash on its book
(RMB13.5 per share as of 1H18). In this report, we argue that such is very unlikely
in the next 3 years in our view, due to: (1) Gree's increased lending to distributors
to maintain their liquidity and (2) Gree may hold signiﬁcant interbank assets. We
cut our cash DPS (dividend per share) forecasts in 2019/20 by 21%/24% to RMB
1.9/1.9 (23%/29% lower than Bloomberg Finance LP consensus).
Gree's surging ﬁnancing to distributors hinting deteriorating liquidity in the
channel, and poor revenue ahead
■
In 1H18, Gree's "financing to distributors" reached a new high since
2014 ( pre-inventory crisis): we calculate Gree's ﬁnancing to distributors
(see the third bullet point for deﬁnition) has reached RMB45bn in 1H18, up
45% YoY. Based on a study on the 2015 inventory cycle, a sharp increase
in ﬁnancing to distributors tends to mean worsened distributor liquidity.
As a result, distributor orders (sales) in the subsequent year tend to be
poor (Figure 1 and 2).
■
Outlook: we forecast Gree to increase its financing to distributors
further, and such may lead to accelerated cash out ﬂow while curbing
management's incentive to increase cash dividend payout.
■
Financing to distributors: an indicator designed for AC (air conditioner)
brands: for most wholesale consumer companies, accounts receivable
serves as the main funding source to distributors. However, the case of
AC (Gree and Midea) is more complicated, due to: (1) AC brands collect
cash from distributors before shipping products, thus holding a liability
(advance from customers), instead of assets (accounts receivable), (2)
Gree and Midea have accelerated their lending to distributors. To
cope with the increased complexity, we define an indicator "financing
to distributors" (accounts receivable plus loan to distributors minus
advance from customers).
Close to 40% of Gree's cash on book is actually interbank
■
Interbank asset has became a major component in Gree's cash, and
increasing: in 1H18, 37% of Gree's cash on book is interbank asset while
4% being deposit at PBOC. We expect interbank asset as a percentage

of total cash to further increase (Figure 5). We do not expect Gree to
distribute its interbank to investors as Gree may need the interest
revenue to propel earnings growth. Historically, Gree has a tendency to
increase interbank asset as market liquidity is tight (to enjoy the interest
revenue) (Figure 3 & 4).
■
Gree's interest yield on interbank asset has been much higher than
the big banks: interestingly, Gree generated a 4.2% annualized rate
on its interbank asset during 1H18, much higher than China's biggest
commercial banks (Figure 7). We note that Gree's asset yield from
interbank has been consistently higher than the big banks, by a signiﬁcant
spread of 100bps (2014 to 1H18 average).
■
How does Gree generate such a high yield on interbank asset? we
estimate that, in addition to participate in the ordinary interbank market,
Gree may have been lending to smaller banks and/or trust companies
that can "channel" the fund to speciﬁc third parties, including Gree's
distributors.
Figure 1: Gree: revenue declined sharply in 2015 after
ﬁnancing to distributors surged in 2014. In 1H18,
ﬁnancing to distributors crept up again.
Figure 2: Midea: very similar trend.

Revisions, valuation and risks
We take this opportunity to update 2Q18 ﬁnancials (which was in-line with DBe)
and increase Gree's interest revenue signiﬁcantly to model accelerating ﬁnancing
to distributors. Based on the above analysis we cut our forecasted 2019/20 DPS.
Despite of increased earnings forecasts, DBe remains signiﬁcantly lower than
consensus.
Figure 9: Earnings revision
Source: Deutsche Bank estimates, company data
Figure 11: DBe vs. Bloomberg Finance LP consensus
Source: Deutsche Bank estimates, company data
We maintain our target price as increased earnings oﬀset by deteriorated working
capital conditions. Our primary valuation methodology is DCF. As most of Gree's
business comes from China, we use a 9.5% China COE, provided by Deutsche
Bank's economics team. We use a beta of 1 and a long-term growth rate of 1%,
in line with our 1-2% sector assumption for other consumer stocks that we cover.
Downside risks include heavier than expected distributor channel inventory, more
severe pressure on distributor margins and weaker execution on investments.
Upside risks include special cash dividend, easing distributor pressure thanks to
better liquidity and/or lower channel inventory, higher than expected sell-through
thanks to stronger consumer and/or weather and accelerating margin expansion.

Additional Information
The information and opinions in this report were prepared by Deutsche Bank AG or one of its aﬃliates (collectively
"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes
on. Analysts are paid in part based on the proﬁtability of Deutsche Bank AG and its aﬃliates, which includes investment
banking, trading and principal trading revenues.
??
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of
no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
