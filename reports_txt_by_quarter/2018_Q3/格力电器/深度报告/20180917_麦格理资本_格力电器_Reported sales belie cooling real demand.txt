Gree Electric (A-Share) 
Reported sales belie cooling real demand 
Key points 
 Air-conditioner sales growth to moderate on shortfall in demand growth. 
 Investors likely to focus on end-demand rather than reported revenues. 
 We raise FY18 and FY19 EPS estimates by 11% and 4%, but downgrade 
the stock to Neutral and cut our PER-based TP by 24% Rmb38.80. 
 
Conclusion 
 We downgrade Gree to Neutral post 1H18 as we are increasingly cautious on 
the air-conditioner industry in 2H18-1H19, given the high YoY base. We raise 
our earnings est for FY18 by 11% and for FY19 by 4% in view of the strong 
reported sales for 1H18 that we believe are due to strong sell-in. However, we 
cut the target PER from 13.5x FY18E to 9x FY19E. Accordingly, we lower our 
TP by 24% to RMB38.80/sh, as we expect growth to normalise following 
strong earnings growth in the past 24 months. Our FY18-19 earnings are 4% & 
7% below consensus, respectively. Dividend uncertainty remains a concern. 
Impact 
 Air-conditioner sales growth to normalise from 2H18. Gree’s AC 
shipments in China have risen 16% YoY YTD. We expect air-conditioner 
revenue growth to moderate to 8% YoY in 2H18 after last year’s unusually 
high 49% YoY growth, which we believe was partly due to AC demand being 
met earlier than expected. Our channel checks indicate that weaker-than-
expected July retail sales have led to higher channel inventory for the industry, 
which will take time to digest. This, we believe, will cause shipment growth to 
moderate, to relieve pressure on channels.  
 Would it matter if management can hit RMB 200bn sales target for FY18? 
Even if the company meets its FY18 sales target of RMB200bn, we doubt it 
will be a share price catalyst, as it will only increase the market’s scepticism on 
whether there is channel stuffing in air-conditioners, given the strong sales 
revenue growth in the past 24 months. We see end-consumer demand 
measured by either AC installations or retail sell-through as a much more 
important catalyst to the share price than Gree’s sales to channels.  
 Investment in chipset design at what cost? A key reason for the cut in 
dividend is Gree’s intention to invest in chipset design. Its inverter air-
conditioners use mainly imported chipsets that cost RMB4-5bn annually. As 
the chipset is the only air-conditioner component that Gree does not only make 
itself, it is investing in chipset technology R&D to increase its pricing power 
and control costs. Gree has set up a subsidiary with RMB1bn of share capital. 
Earnings and target price revision 
 We raise our reported estimates for FY18 and FY19 by 11% and 4% 
respectively, but cut our target price by 24% to RMB38.80/sh.  
Price catalyst 
 12-month price target: Rmb38.80 based on a PER methodology. 
 Catalyst: 3QFY18 results, 3rd party industry data on AC 
Action and recommendation 
 Downgrade to Neutral.

Investment thesis: Downgrade to Neutral; TP lowered to Rmb38.80/sh 
We lower our target price to Rmb 38.80/sh from Rmb 51.00/sh previously as we lower our earnings 
multiple on FY19E to 9x despite lifting reported EPS by 11% for FY18E and 4% for FY19E. While Gree 
remains the leader in China’s air-conditioner industry by volumes and gains from market consolidation, we 
worry about the FY19 outlook as we fear the demand for air-conditioners may have been drawn in 
advance, following strong air-conditioner selling seasons for two consecutive years—2017 and 2018. The 
AC selling season starts from August and ends in July next year. 
 AC industry growth to moderate in 2H18 and 1H19 after two years of solid growth: According 
to China Industry Online data, Gree’s combined China exports and domestic shipment volumes 
have risen 15% YoY YTD. With the company commenting distributors still willing to restock, we 
believe sell-in volume may still grow in 2H18, but growth is likely to moderate going forward, 
particularly in 1H19, due to a higher base.  
 Still seeing ASP increase at retail level: Based on 1H18 for All View Cloud (AVC) data, Gree 
saw retail ASP grew ~ 5% YoY for residential ACs, compared to a ~3.4% YoY increase for the 
industry.  
 Dividends: Gree has paid out 28% of its 1H18 earnings at RMB 60cents per share, which is much 
lower than the 70% full-year payout in 2015 and 2016. According to its interim report, the company 
plans to invest in chip design, as it wants to save the over RMB4-5 billion that it currently spends 
annually on imported chipsets.     
Our new target price is based on 9x FY19E PER vs 13.5x FY18E previously. We believe the company‘s 
dividend payout has disappointed the market, which remains concerned about the size of investment in 
chipset design, especially in the context of the broader slowdown in AC sales. We lower our multiple to 
factor in this uncertainty and will wait on the sidelines for a better entry point.

Earnings revision 
We are raising our reported profit estimates for 2018 and 2019 by 11% and 4% respectively, in view of the 
stronger than expected results for 1H18. Our FY18 revenue estimate of RMB181bn is below the 
management’s target of RMB200bn. 
 Revenue: We lift FY18E revenues by 16% and FY19E by 9% as we expect the group to further 
drive its AC sell-in into its regional sales office this year to achieve the revenue target of 
RMB200bn. For FY19, we have some concern on demand normalising, given the high comparison 
base in 1H18, which may be reflecting demand spent in advance, in our view. 
 Gross margin: We cut our gross margins assumptions for FY18 and FY19 by 2.0 and 2.2ppts 
respectively as we believe our previous expectations may be too high. We believe as the company 
diversifies its revenue stream, it may see lower margins due to negative impact from a revenue mix 
change. At the same time, we expect gross margin from the export business to get further 
compressed to only 7.3% in FY18E vs 13.1% in 1H17. 
 Operating margin: We raise our OP margin estimate for FY18 by 10bps but cut it for FY19 by 
30bps as we believe Gree’s efficiency enhancement, strict control in selling & distribution expense, 
will be offset by increased spending on chip design investment, which is unlikely to generate near-
term returns.  
 Dividends: We lower our payout ratio assumption for 2018 and beyond to 40% on the back of the 
28% payout for 1H18. We believe the company is likely holding back cash for future investment but 
should have more clarity in 2H18.

Advance from customers starting to trend down 
According to the latest 2Q18 balance sheet data, receipts in advance amounted to RMB2.1bn, down 67% 
YoY. The last time advances from customers reached this level was in 2Q14. According to the company, it 
still has healthy cash payback from distributors, while the current channel inventory levels does not 
suggest the company’s sell-in has been excessive. We believe this likely meant no incremental end-
demand to trigger additional deposits from distributors.

Domestic shipment volumes for 2Q18 up 16% YoY 
According to China Market Monitor, which collects data from modern channels across Tier 1-4 cities, 
Gree’s residential AC retail sales volume grew 0.5% YoY in 2Q18. This compares to 15.6% YoY growth in 
domestic shipments. From July data, CMM data showed retail volume down 30% YoY vs domestic 
shipment volumes up 14.6% YoY.

We believe likely Gree is increasing support to its trading companies 
Gree has 27 regional sales companies in China, which serve as intermediaries to distribute ACs to 
retailers at modern channels and to retailers in lower-tier cities. As ~70% of AC retail sales happen 
between March and August, generally retailers need to stock up ACs ahead of time before the peak 
season, since supply during the peak season is generally not enough to meet demand. 
We believe part of the discrepancy can be accounted for as inventory at the sales office to be distributed to 
retailers, as they have more financial resources. In particular, based on company registration search site 
qichacha.com, since 2011, Beijing Shengshi Hengxing Geli International Trading Co., Ltd (北京盛世恒兴格
力国际贸易有限公司) investing in 31 trading companies focusing air conditioner distribution from 27 
regions and 20 companies on lifestyle appliances, would be able to help manage the distribution and 
pricing architecture within these regions and balance the interests of the smaller distributors. 
At the same time, in a recent announcement, the company’s financing arm is increasing the cap on the line 
of credit to Zhejiang Shengxi Yinxing Geli trading Co., Ltd (浙江盛世欣兴格力贸易有限公司) from 
RMB500m to RMB 1bn due to business environment. This can be shown as Gree increasing its support to 
the trading companies. As of 1H18, Gree has generated product revenue of RMB2.64bn from the company 
vs a loan amount of RMB300m.

Earnings review 
1H18 revenue grew 31.4% YoY to RMB 92bn, reaching 51% of full-year consensus or 46% of 
management’s RMB200bn target. Gross margin contracted 1.9ppt to 30.8% but operating profit margin 
expanded by 70bps to 16.2%, while net profit grew 35.5% to RMB12.8bn, accounting for 47% of full-year 
consensus earnings.  
 Air conditioners: Revenue grew 38.8% YoY in 1H18. The strength of the first-half results can be 
supported by the double-digit shipment growth in air-conditioners. Gross margin declined 4.1ppt to 
34.4%, which we believe is due to gross margin pressure from the export segment.  
 Household appliances: Revenue grew 56% YoY to RMB1.6bn, with gross margin compressing by 
2.4ppt to 17%. We believe the company still lacks scale in household appliances. 
 Intelligent equipment: Revenue declined 63% to RMB356m; however, gross margin expanded by 
6.9ppt to 11.7%. We believe the margin improvement may be due to the company starting to 
deliver orders to better-quality external customers. 
 Operating cashflow: Operating cashflow increased 146% to RMB8.9, due to increase in other 
cash inflow related to operating activities.  
 Sales rebate: This other current liability amount remains relatively stable, down 1.4% YoY to 
RMB59.2bn. 
 Advance received from customer. This amount declined by 67% YoY and 85% HoH to 
RMB2.1bn. The company highlighted this was due to high growth in domestic sales resulting in 
higher shipments to distributors and leading to lower balance for customer advances. 
 Dividend payout at 28% of interim earnings: The company declared an interim dividend per 
share of RMB60c, representing 28% of 1H18 earnings and below ~70% payout in 2015 and 2016. 
We believe this reflects the company’s keenness on investing in AC chipsets.  
 Quarterly trend. On a quarterly basis, revenue growth moderated slightly to 30% from 33% in 
1Q18 while net profit growth maintained similar momentum at 37.6% vs 1Q18 at 39%.
