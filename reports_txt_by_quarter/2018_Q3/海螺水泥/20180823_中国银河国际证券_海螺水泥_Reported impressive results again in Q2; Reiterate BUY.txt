China Cement Sector 
Conch Cement reported a recurring net profit of RMB8.2bn in Q2 2018, up 123% YoY 
and near the high end of the guidance provided in the positive profit alert. Blended ASP 
(cement and clinker) rose from RMB297/tonne in Q1 2018 to RMB316/tonne in Q2 
2018. 1H18 net profit is equivalent to 54% of the full-year consensus forecast. This sug-
gests the Street is likely to raise the full-year forecast, based on the historical seasonali-
ty pattern. We also raise our 2018E/2019E EPS by 25.6%/29%, as the price correction 
during the summer season in east China and south China is much smaller than we ex-
pected. We reiterate our BUY rating and raise our H-share target price from HK$59.50 
(2.5x 2018E PBR) to HK$65 (2.7x 2018E PBR) (A-share target price: RMB53.10, 6% 
discount to our H-share target price, based on the average discount in the past few 
years). The upcoming peak season will be a key catalyst, in our view. 
Investment Highlights 
Q2 recurring net profit surged 123% YoY. Excluding some one-off gains recorded in 
Q2 2017, recurring net profit in Q2 2018 jumped 123% YoY to RMB8.2bn. Revenue 
grew 47% YoY to RMB27.3bn, driven by (i) volume growth of 12.7% to 83.8m tonnes 
and (ii) a blended ASP price rise from RMB236/tonne in Q2 2017 to RMB316/tonne in 
Q2 2018. Gross profit per tonne increased from RMB81 in Q2 2017 to RMB146 in Q2 
2018 (Q1 2018: RMB124).  
Impressive operating cost control. Operating costs were RMB1.8bn in Q2 2018, up 
21% YoY, much slower than revenue growth of 47%. The Company’s balance sheet 
continued to get stronger, with the net cash position expanding from RMB10.5bn at end
-2017 to RMB14.2bn at end-June 2018.  
Strong revenue growth in overseas business but the scale remained small. The 
Company’s overseas revenue jumped 44.96% YoY to RMB482m in 1H18. However, 
the scale was still limited, as overseas revenue accounted for only 1% of total revenue. 
Only a moderate price correction during the low season. Usually the summer sea-
son is considered to be the low season due to unfavourable weather conditions, such 
as typhoons and extremely hot weather. However, as Figure 2 and 3 show, the correc-
tion in cement prices in east China and south China was very moderate in Q2. This 
paves the way for price hikes in late Q3 and Q4 during the peak season for construction 
activity. Therefore, we raise our 2018E/2019E EPS by 25.6%/29%, as the price correc-
tion during the summer season was much smaller than we expected. 
Upcoming peak season to be a major catalyst. Conch Cement is trading at 8x 
2018E PER and 2.02x 2018E PBR. We expect the upcoming peak season of construc-
tion activity to be a key catalyst to drive the share price higher. 
Reported impressive results again in Q2; Reiterate BUY
