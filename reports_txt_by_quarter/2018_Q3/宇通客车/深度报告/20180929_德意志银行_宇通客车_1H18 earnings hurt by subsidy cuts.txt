1H18 earnings hurt by subsidy cuts
3.5ppt YoY gross proﬁt margin erosion leading to 23% YoY earnings drop
Yutong announced on 27 August that its 1H18 net proﬁt dropped 23.4% YoY to
RMB616.5m. As this accounts for only 16% of our previous FY18 estimates, we
consider the results a miss. 1H18 gross revenue grew 29.0% YoY to RMB12.0bn
on the back of a 13.5% YoY rise in bus sales volume and increased new energy
bus mix. Yet with the eﬀect of new energy vehicle (NEV) subsidy cut, Yutong’s
1H18 gross proﬁt margin contracted 3.5ppts YoY to 20.9%. In addition, SG&A
also grew at a faster pace than topline growth. As a result, SG&A expense ratio
climbed to 16.1% (vs. 14.9% in 1H17).
The company hosted a conference call today. Key takeaways are as follows:
■
Proﬁt decline: management attributed the proﬁt decline to the rise in R&D
expense and changes in the NEV subsidy policy. To elaborate, the 30%
YoY subsidy cut was applied during the transition period (between 12
February 2018 to 11 June 2018). Post 11 June, a 40% YoY cut was applied,
which had a negative impact on the company's earnings.
■
Sales volume: 1H18 sales volume increased by 13.5% YoY to 24,780
units, with sales volume of new energy bus up 195.7% to 8,765 units and
traditional bus down 15.0% YoY to 16,015 units. In terms of breakdown
by region, the domestic market rose 24.3% YoY to 21,721 units, whilst
overseas markets were under pressure, down 29.8% YoY to 3,059 units.
■
Cost cutting: Despite the challenging margin proﬁle in 1H18, the company
expects gross proﬁt margin to gradually recover on the back of: 1)
improved pricing of new products; 2) better cost control as purchase
costs of battery/electric motor/electronic control unit have declined; and
3) increased sales volume, which would lead to lower unit ﬁxed costs.
■
Guidance: The company maintains its FY18 target – sales volumes returns
to 2016 levels; revenue to reach c.RMB34bn; net proﬁt to maintain at the
2017 level.
Deutsche Bank view – still a well positioned new energy bus manufacturer
On the back of the strong 1H18 topline growth and thus higher ASP assumptions,
we raise our FY18-20 revenue forecast by 6.3-6.6% on higher ASP assumptions.
On the other hand, with Yutong's weaker-than-expected capability to cut cost

and mitigate subsidy cut pressure, as well as higher SG&A expense estimate on
higher R&D, we cut our FY18-20 forecast by 14.3-14.9%.
We still like Yutong's established market position in the bus segment, including
the new energy bus segment, and believe its earnings outlook should improve
with long-term receding of subsidy cut impacts. Our target price is based on 15.0x
FY18/19E P/E (from 15.0x FY18E), about 35% more than Yutong's mid-cycle P/
E of 11x to reﬂect our optimism on Yutong's increased proﬁt contribution from
the new energy bus segment. This is justiﬁable, in our view, as we expect the
company to deliver a 11% three-year earnings CAGR in FY17-20E. Key downside
risks for Yutong include: 1) unexpected changes in the Chinese government's new
energy bus subsidy policy; 2) weaker-than-expected new energy bus demand;
and 3) market share loss in new energy buses.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
