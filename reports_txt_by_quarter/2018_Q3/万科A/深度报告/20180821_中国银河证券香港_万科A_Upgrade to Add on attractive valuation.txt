China Vanke-A 
Upgrade to Add on attractive valuation  
■ Vanke’s 1H18 core net profit rose 44% yoy to Rmb10.4bn, 15% above our estimate, 
on the back of higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin.  
■ We expect gross margin (post land appreciation tax, LAT) to stay at a high level of 25-
27% over FY18-20F.  
■ We believe the major overhang on its share price has been removed as Baoneng has 
in the past few months already disposed of an 8% stake in it (vs. target of 10%). 
■ Vanke has a sizeable Rmb520bn of sold but unrecognised sales. We estimate it has 
already locked in over 95%/65% of FY18F/FY19F earnings. 
■ Upgrade to Add in view of its attractive valuation. Our TP of Rmb35.0 is unchanged.  
1H18’s core earnings beat our estimate by 15% 
Vanke announced a stronger-than-expected set of results, with core net profit rising 44% 
yoy to Rmb10.4bn, 15% ahead our estimate, on the back of higher-than-expected volume 
and gross margin. No interim dividend was declared as usual. Net gearing increased 
from 9% at end-2017 to 33% at end-Jun, primarily due to one-off expenses to take Global 
Logistic Properties private. 
Contracted sales could see 31% yoy growth in FY18F 
In 7M18, Vanke grew its contracted sales by 12% yoy to Rmb350bn. Given that it will 
have more sellable resources in 2H18F, we estimate that Vanke should be able to 
achieve total contracted sales of Rmb695bn in FY18F, representing 31% yoy growth. 
Gross margin to stay at 25-27% over FY18-20F 
Its gross margin (post land appreciation tax, LAT) for 1H18 came in at 27.4%, up 2.1% 
pts yoy and 1.9% pts above our estimate, driven by bookings of relatively high profit 
margin projects in 1H18 and recovery of the overall property market since 2016. We 
expect its gross margin to be maintained at 25-27% over FY18-20F, supported by rapid 
price hikes for its property projects. 
Overhang on Vanke removed 
In Apr 2018, it was reported that Baoneng Group plans to dispose of a 10% stake in 
Vanke-A. In the subsequent months, Baoneng reduced its stake in Vanke-A by about 8%, 
according to the latter’s stock exchange’s announcements (refer to Figure 2 for more 
details). This suggests that it only has a c.2% stake to be disposed of in the coming 
months (total consideration of c.Rmb5bn at current share price). As such, we believe the 
major overhang on its share price has been removed. 
Huge unbooked sales secure earnings for FY18F and FY19F   
As at Jun, Vanke has a sizeable Rmb520bn of sold but unrecognised sales; we expect 
most of these to be recognised in 2H18F and FY19F. As such, we assess that Vanke has 
already locked in over 95% of FY18F earnings and 65% of FY19F earnings.     
Upgrade to Add on attractive valuations  
We raise our EPS estimates by 5% for FY18-20F after updating the property completion 
schedule. Our target price of Rmb35.0 is based on par to NAV. We upgrade to Add on 
attractive valuations. Vanke-A is currently trading at 33% discount to NAV, 6x FY19F P/E 
and 5% dividend yield, which looks appealing, in our view. Potential re-rating catalysts 
include stronger-than-expected contracted sales. Key downside risks are a slowdown in 
China’s economy, and further tightening policies imposed by the government.
