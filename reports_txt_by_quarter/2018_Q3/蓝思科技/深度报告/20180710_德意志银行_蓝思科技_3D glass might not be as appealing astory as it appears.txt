The 3D glass upgrade should increase Lens’s product ASP but not necessarily 
boost its gross margin, given higher costs and lower production yield. Also, we 
think the captive account (Apple) will likely stick with 2.5D glass in 2018/2019. 
Lastly, for the long term, we see a potential over-supply risk, and rising threats 
from alternative materials (ceramic, sapphire, etc.). The arrival of foldable 
display (likely 2020 or 2021) might be negative for the glass maker too, as it 
requires a cover lens, made from film, instead of glass; maintain Hold. 
Glass back-cover and 3D glass are clear trends for near/mid-term 
Major Chinese OEMs have by now launched their 2018 flagship devices. As 
the market anticipated, most of them (Huawei P20, Vivo X21, Vivo NEX, Oppo 
R15, Xiaomi M8, etc.) have adopted the 3D glass back-cover design. We think 
the 3D glass trend will stay with high-end phones in 2019 as well. In general, 
ASPs of 3D glass could be 100% higher than that of 2.5D glass. But, on the flip 
side, its gross margin could be noticeably lower, due to longer cycle time, 
higher production costs and lower production yield (manufacturing complexity 
in the heating bending, chemical strengthening and decoration/coating 
processes).  
Over-supply as a long-term risk – more competitor + alternative materials        
For the past decade, the smartphone glass market has been a duopolistic one, 
dominated by Lens Tech and Biel Crystal. However, the fast adoption of glass 
back-cover and 3D glasses has drawn aggressive investments and capacity 
expansion from new competitors, like BYD Elec, AAC, O-Film, Victory 
Prevision, etc. Due to high entry barriers, they might not cause a dent in the 
near term, but some of them could emerge to become legitimate competitors 
by 2019 or 2020, given their solid relationship with tier-one OEMs and good 
track records in business expansion. Also, 3D glass might not be the only 
solution for high-end devices. Some might switch to ceramic, sapphire, or 
metallic plastic for back-cover materials. The potential long–term upgrade will 
be the foldable display, which requires the cover lens (i.e. the front cover) to be 
made from film rather than glass.  
Valuation and risks  
We cut 2018/19 EPS forecasts by 43%/40%, respectively, to reflect potential 
GPM decline, lack of upgrade in iPhone cover glass, and a 50% stock dividend 
(the stock dividend alone will reduce EPS by 33%). We hence lower our TP 
from CNY29.4 to CNY14. Our new TP is still based on 0.8x PEG, or 20x PER. 
0.8x PEG is in line with regional peers. Upside/downside risks include: 
strong/weak iPhone demand, ASP hike/decline, and market share gain/loss.

believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank 
may 
act 
as 
principal 
for 
its 
own 
account 
or 
as 
agent 
for 
another 
person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, 
perspectives or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers 
it writes on. Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. 
Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , 
and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company’s page. A Catalyst Call represents a 
high-conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector 
over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may 
occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the 
frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company-specific economic prospects make it 
difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the 
Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is 
provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial 
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial 
instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of 
the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and 
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are 
subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in 
exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are 
current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and 
other 
vendors.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income 
instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX 
depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by 
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons 
indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency 
that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks 
typical

options 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax 
position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take 
expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed 
exchange controls, which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.  
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://research.db.com/Research/ on each company’s research page. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this 
information before investing.
