1H18 - strong earnings, but weak cash
ﬂow
Strong volume growth and margin expansion in 1H18
Wuliangye reported 1H18 results with 37% sales growth and 43% earnings
growth, slightly better than its preliminary result announced on Aug 13 (34%/37%
for sales/PBT). We estimate the sales growth was driven by 27% growth from
mainstream Wuliangye (7% ASP and 20% volume) and 10% growth from mid-
range Wuliangye (mainly volume). Net margin expanded 140bps yoy to 33.2%,
helped mainly by lower SG&A/sales ratio with strong expense control, lower
rebate and operating leverage, while partly oﬀset by higher sales tax ratio.
On quarterly basis, Wuliangye's sales grew by 37% in 1Q18 and 38% in 2Q18, but
earnings growth accelerated from 38% in 1Q18 to 55% in 2Q18, mainly due to
less impact from higher sales tax ratio (the new sales tax policy was implemented
May 1, 2017).
Yet operating cash ﬂow declined signiﬁcantly
Wuliangye's operating cash ﬂow declined 81% yoy to Rmb597mn in 1H18, and
in 2Q18, there's a net cash ﬂow out of Rmb1.8bn. This is mainly due to Rmb3bn
increase in tax payment and rising note receivable balance, which increased by
Rmb5.8bn in 1H18 (vs. Rmb2bn increase in 1H17). Due to low channel margin,
Wuliangye accepted increasing amount of bank notes from distributors. We think
this implies that retail end demand might not be as strong as Wuliangye's ex-
factory sales.
Growth might slow from 2H18
We think Wuliangye's growth might be peaking in 2Q18 due to three reasons.
First, super premium liquor is more correlated with macro environment due to
its discretionary nature; slowing ﬁxed asset investment might result in lower
demand. Second, Wuliangye beneﬁtted from Moutai's out-of-stock situation in
2017, yet Moutai's increasing supply and potential channel de-stocking might
result in increasing competition. Third, distributors' procurement interest could be
pressured by low channel margins. The weak operating cash ﬂow in 1H18 could
be a signal of slowing sales growth.
Maintaining Buy
We revising up our earnings forecast in 2018-20E by 6%-8% to factor in the higher
sales growth in 1H18 and margin expansion in near term. While we see potential
sales slowdown in near-term, we maintain our Buy rating for its long-term growth.
We expect management's new channel strategy and brand building measures to

with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or

?
Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
