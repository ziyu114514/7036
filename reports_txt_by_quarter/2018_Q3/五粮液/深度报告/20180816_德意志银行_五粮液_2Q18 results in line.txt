2Q18 results in line
Sales and proﬁt before tax up 34% and 37% respectively in 2Q18
Wuliangye reported preliminary results with proﬁt before tax increasing 37% yoy
to RMB2.8bn on sales up 34% yoy to RMB7.3bn in 2Q18 (vs. 37% for sales
and 39% for PBT in 1Q18). The result is in line with market consensus and
our expectation. We estimate the sales growth was driven by 25%-30% volume
growth and 4%-7% ASP increase due to limited contribution from ex-quota price.
Near-term growth might slow down; maintaining buy on long-term outlook
According to our channel check, Wuliangye's tier 1 distributors' selling price
slightly picked up by about RMB10/bottle since it started to control its ex-factory
volume from late June. To support its retail price, we expect Wuliangye to
continue controlling its supply by reducing ex-quota volume. This will drag down
its sales growth in near term, but beneﬁt its long term healthy growth. We are
still positive on the company's long term growth potential based on its expanding
channel penetration and improving operating eﬃciency, maintaining buy.
Our TP is based on DCF model (factoring in 9.5% WACC and 2.0% terminal growth
rate). Downside risks: channel de-stocking in high-end liquor sector; worse than
expected retail price decline; worse than expected macro FAI slow down.

liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be

belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of
no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in

Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
