Uncertainties on future transition but
negatives priced in; Hold
Aggressive expansion target but uncertainty looms over NCM; maintaining Hold
As the third-largest Chinese battery player, Guoxuan positions itself to more than
double its capacity from 7.5GWh in 2017 to c.18GWh by end-2020, and targets
to triple its market share to c.18% in three years. However, we believe there is
still uncertainty regarding Guoxuan's endeavors in NCM (lithium nickel cobalt
manganese oxide) batteries (c.22% of 2017 shipment) after the disappointments
in the past 12 months. We set our target multiple at 15.4x 2019E P/E, in line with
the industry average, and revise our target price to RMB15.6 while maintaining
Hold.
Targets to triple its Chinese battery market share to 18% in 2020
On top of the existing 7.5GWh capacity in 2017 (including 5.5GWh for LFP (lithium
iron phosphate) and 2.0GWh for NCM), Guoxuan is adding 2GWh LFP capacity
and c.4GWh NCM capacity in 2018. Total capacity is expected to reach c.18GWh
by end-2020 at a 3-year CAGR of 33%, but revised down from 20-25GWh
previously. The company's mid-term strategic target is to triple market share from
6% in 2017 to c.18% in 2020, to become a formidable competitor against the
current industry leader CATL.
Meaningful progress on NCM batteries in 2H18 remains to be seen
The company is upgrading its NCM lines in Hefei and Qingdao for all NCM622
production starting in 2H18, and expects its NCM battery shipment to reach
1.3GWh in 2018, or +92% YoY. Guoxuan supplied it batteries to 45k units of NEV
in 2017, and aims to reach 100k units in 2018 with orders by domestic brands
including BAIC, Geely, Zotye, Chery, SAIC, and JAC. However, it remains to be
seen whether Guoxuan, a previously LFP-focused battery manufacturer (c.78% of
2017 shipment), can have a meaningful presence in NCM batteries.
Cutting target price to RMB15.6; concerns factored in; risks
We believe the c.40% share price decline in the past three months has reﬂected
investors' concerns such as a) ASP/margin pressure in the medium term and b)
the uncertainty regarding its transition to NCM batteries. Factoring the 19% YoY
ASP decline and shipment disappointment in 2017, we cut our 2018/2019 NPAT
forecasts by -27%/-50%. We set the target multiple at 15.4x 2019E P/E, in line
with the industry average, and revise our TP accordingly. Risks: quicker/slower-
than-expected ASP cut or cost drop.

Aggressive capacity
expansion
Adding 6GWh battery capacity to reach 13.5GWh in 2018
Guoxuan had 7.5GWh battery capacity at the end of 2017, of which 5.5GWh was
for LFP batteries and 2.0GWh for NCM batteries. On top of the existing capacity,
the company sets an aggressive target to add additional 2GWh capacity for LFP
and c.4GWh NCM capacity this year in Hefei and Qingdao, reaching c.13.5GWh
at the end of 2018.
Expects to see NCM battery demand picking up
While Guoxuan is one of the top battery suppliers in LFP batteries (mostly adopted
by EV buses), the company expects to see EV battery demand from passenger
vehicles pick up, where NCM batteries consist of over 80% share. Guoxuan
thus gradually shifts its focus to NCM batteries production, expanding its NCM
capacity more than ﬁve-fold from 2GWh in 2017 to 10.4GWh at end-2020.
We have outlined Guoxuan's capacity breakdown in Figure 1 below, where the
additional NCM production lines are mainly planned in Hefei's fourth factory (total
c.5GWh) and Qingdao Laixi factory (c.4GWh).

Guoxuan High-Tech
Targets to triple its Chinese battery market share to 18% in 2020
Guoxuan's total capacity is expected to reach c.18GWh by end-2020, expanding
at a 3-year CAGR of 33%. However, this target has been revised down from
20-25GWh by end-2020 as the company's previous expectations on a) capacity
ramp up time, and b) market demand were too optimistic. The company's mid-
term strategic target is to triple its market share from 6% in 2017 to c.18% in 2020,
which implies that it will become a formidable competitor against the current
industry leader CATL. Regarding the timing for production lines addition in a
year, we expect to see Guoxuan's capacity commencement to mostly fall in the
second half in each year, per the company's schedule. Therefore, the capacity
commencement schedule creates a larger gap between its eﬀective capacity
and year-end capacity for Guoxuan, compared to a smaller gap for CATL as the
latter's capacity commencement schedule is more evenly distributed throughout
the year. Please see Figure 2 and Figure 3 below for Guoxuan and CATL's sales
volume, eﬀective capacity and year-end capacity estimates.

Uncertainty over NCM
endeavor
Meaningful progress on NCM batteries remains to be seen
The company is upgrading its NCM lines in Hefei and Qingdao for all NCM622
production starting in 2H18 (see Figure 1), and expects its NCM battery shipment
to reach 1.3GWh in 2018, or +92% YoY. As NCM batteries are mainly installed
on EV passenger vehicles, Guoxuan has supplied 45k units of these in 2017, and
aims to reach 100k units in 2018.
The company has a positive 2H18 outlook of NCM batteries owing to: a) orders by
domestic brands including BAIC, Geely, Zotye, Chery, JAC, b) a larger battery pack
per vehicle to meet the longer driving range requirement, and c) market share gain
from cylindrical batteries, as Guoxuan believes the prismatic packaging format is
more cost eﬀective when the vehicle carries over 30kWh.
A mixed picture between LFP and NCM market shares
However, we believe it is still too early to tell whether Guoxuan can repeat its
success in LFP batteries in the NCM ﬁeld. We present the top 10 EV battery
installation analysis in 2017 and 5M18 in Figure 4 and Figure 5, where Guoxuan
YTD has gained market share in LFP batteries (from 10.0% in 2017 to 14.6% in
5M18) but barely had NCM batteries installation (from 2.3% in 2017 to 0.8% in
5M18). We believe the main reason behind the fall is linked to the diﬀerent timings
of auto OEMs model launch schedules, but it requires additional orders from EV
passenger vehicles if the company wants to have a meaningful presence in NCM
batteries, judging from the market share analysis YTD.

Earnings and target price
revisions
Factoring in 2017 results; cutting target price to RMB15.6
Guoxuan's 2017 battery ASP and shipment were below our original expectations
due to intense competition and battery shipment adjustments at year-end. We
have revised our numbers after factoring the 2017 ﬁnancial results, battery
volume, unit pricing and margin trajectory. Since changes in the battery industry
happened faster than our previous expectation, we cut our 2018/2019 net proﬁt
forecast by 27%/50%.
Please see Figure 6 below for our detailed sales volume and unit margin
assumptions. For our forecast changes and consensus comparison for Guoxuan,
please refer to Figure 7 and Figure 8:
■
For our 2018E earnings revision: we believe the battery's pricing pressure
(-16% YoY) will be somewhat oﬀset by cost decline (-10% YoY), but the
main factor to have a negative impact on earnings estimate should be
volume assumption (-37% vs. previous estimate).
■
For our 2019E earnings revision: we expect the cumulative eﬀect from
pricing pressure (-13% YoY), coupled with volume assumption revision
(-36% vs. previous estimate), to comprise most of the negative impact
on our earnings estimate.

Concerns largely factored in with c.40% correction in 3 months
Guoxuan's share price has corrected by c.40% in the past three months (Figure
9), which has mainly reﬂected investors' concern related to: a) ASP and margin
pressure in the medium term and b) the uncertainty regarding the transition
to NCM batteries. We believe the entire battery sector has encountered similar
issues, except for the market leader CATL, and several battery players are also
looking into a transition similar to that of Guoxuan.

Target multiple at 15.4x 2019E P/E, in line with battery peer average
After a 19%/23% share price correction in the battery sector (Figure 10), the peers
are currently trading at 19.0x/15.4x 2018E/2019E P/E on average. We believe P/E
methodology is still the most suitable to value the company, and we roll forward a
year to set our target multiple at 15.4x 2019E EPS, which is in line with the average
of battery manufacturers. Therefore, we adjust our target price to RMB15.6.

Guoxuan High-Tech
Investment thesis
Outlook
Guoxuan is the third-largest EV lithium battery player in China, with c.6%
EV lithium battery market share in terms of installation this year. We believe
Guoxuan's aggressive capacity expansion and competitive advantages should
help it to grow market share and make it one of the beneﬁciaries of the Chinese
government's target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020. However,
battery unit pricing decline and EV subsidy policy change may put pressure on
its margin outlook. Hold.
Valuation
As Guoxuan has listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO in 2015, we
believe its historical P/E band may not reﬂect its future outlook. We adopt a 2019E
P/E multiple of 15.4x for the company, which we believe has factored in its growth
trajectory and is in line with battery manufacturers' average.
Risks
Key Industry up/downside risks: 1) Signiﬁcant changes in the Chinese
government's EV subsidy policy 2) Weaker/stronger-than-expected volume
growth in the next three years 3) Quicker/slower-than-expected ASP drop or
slower-than-expected cost cuts.

Additional Information
The information and opinions in this report were prepared by Deutsche Bank AG or one of its aﬃliates (collectively
"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor
is responsible for the accuracy or security controls of those websites.
??
If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes
on. Analysts are paid in part based on the proﬁtability of Deutsche Bank AG and its aﬃliates, which includes investment
banking, trading and principal trading revenues.
??
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of
no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.

the investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conﬂict disclosures can also be found at
