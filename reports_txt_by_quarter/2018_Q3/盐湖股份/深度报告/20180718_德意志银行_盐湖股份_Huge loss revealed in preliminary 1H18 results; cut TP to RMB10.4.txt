Huge loss revealed in preliminary 1H18
results; cut TP to RMB10.4
Proﬁt warnings: loss at least doubled yoy in 1H18; retain Hold
QSLI announced preliminary 1H18 results with net loss of RMB1.05-1.25bn vs.
loss of RMB0.52bn in 1H17, widened by 100%-139% yoy. This implies 2Q18
loss of RMB0.78-0.98bn vs 1Q18 loss of RMB0.27bn. The accelerated loss was
driven by: 1) slow ramp up on magnesium integration project after production
started in late 2017; 2) Haina PVC production suspension in April and accrued loss
of RMB0.47bn; 3) chemical integration project impacted by limited natural gas
supply and accrued loss of RMB0.33bn. We revise our estimates after accounting
for the higher loss (by 129%) in 2018E but revised up 2019E earnings (by 79%)
on higher ASPs due to lower RMB:USD FX. We trim our TP to RMB10.4 (9%).
Segmental update: Potash and Lithium +ve
■
Potash production was roughly ﬂat yoy at 1.93mnton while sales
improved 18.9% yoy to 2.20mnton and ASP up RMB230/ton yoy in 1H18.
■
Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3) production was 5,329ton (+129% yoy) while
sales volume improved by 78% yoy to 3,950ton. The company said
Lanke's new 20ktpa capacity construction has started while the 30ktpa
JV project with BYD is under preparatory work stage.
■
Magnesium project daily output now is at 50ton which is quite a bit of
distance away from the target operational level.
■
Chemical integration project production was signiﬁcantly impacted by
lack of natural gas supply in 1H18. The company has restarted phase 1
site in July; the current run-rate for the chemical integration project is
at 150%. Conversely, due to the 4.26 accident, Haina PVC facility is still
oﬄine and may not resume in the near term.
Valuation and risk
We revised our TP to RMB10.4 based on a DCF (assuming a 6.2% WACC and 2%
terminal growth). Our TP implies 1.5x P/B in with 1.5% ROE in 2019E. We see
longer term risks and rewards as balanced at the current valuation, supported
by a potentially ROE accretive debt-to-equity swap plan and long term structural
growth of EV batteries. Key downside risks: 1) sluggish chemical prices and soft
demand; and 2) unfavorable government policy. Key upside risks: 1) better-than-
expected potash prices; and 2) better than expected demand.

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
