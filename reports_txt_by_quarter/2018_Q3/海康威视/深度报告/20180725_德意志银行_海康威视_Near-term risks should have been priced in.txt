Valuation and investment risks  
We trim 2018/19 EPS forecasts by 1-6% 
to price in the continued investment in 
talent 
recruitment 
and 
innovative 
business. We trim our TP from CNY43 to 
CNY41, still based on 30x 2H18-1H19E 
PE, which is at the average of the top two 
bands. We believe the company can reach 
this level given the accelerated earning 
growth 
from industry leadership, AI 
exposure, and a surge in innovation 
business and margin improvement.  Our 
target multiple is supported by the strong 
growth outlook and ROE delivery. Risks: 
market share loss, weak demand in 
industry 
project 
orders, 
political 
uncertainties in overseas markets.
Hikvision reported in-line 2Q18 results and expected 1-3Q18 profit to grow in 
the same range of 15-35% YoY. Despite a continued negative impact from the 
Chinese government’s deleveraging policy and political/economic uncertainties 
in overseas markets, we believe Hikvision’s short-term softness is temporary 
and order momentum could pick up again, with uncertainties easing over time 
and a healthier industry dynamic in the domestic market. Maintaining Buy. 
In-line 2Q18 results  
Hikvision reported 2Q18 EPS and operating profit of CNY0.25 (+28% QoQ, 
+29% YoY) and CNY2.0bn (-3% QoQ, +1%YoY), on sales of CNY11.5bn (+23% 
QoQ, +22% YoY). Sales/gross profit were broadly in line with DB/consensus 
estimates, as the market has already factored in the political impacts. 
However, expenses rose in 2Q18, due to 1) rising recruitment fees for sales 
people and R&D engineers, 2) higher exhibition fees and 3) one-time expense 
for the third phase of industrial park opening in Hangzhou. With help from a 
non-op gain, net profit slightly missed DBe by 4%.  
Slower 1-3Q18 guidance but long-term outlook remains intact 
Hikvision expects 1-3Q18 net profit to rise 15%-35% YoY, implying 3Q18 net 
profit of CNY2.9bn-4.2bn, or a midpoint of CNY3.5bn (+24% YoY). Although a 
solid figure, this guidance trails Bloomberg consensus (CNY3.8bn) by 8%, due 
to 1) the economic/political uncertainties in overseas markets, 2) the continual 
impact of the Chinese government’s deleveraging policy, and 3) the small 
public security projects being squeezed by the nationwide projects in the short 
run. Aside from this, Hikvision remains positive on its 2018 and long-term 
outlook, noting: 1) the innovation business posted 80% YoY growth in 1H18 
and the high growth will continue; 2) a rising contribution from the Sky 
Net/Sharp Eyes projects as Hikvision is the key beneficiary of the Chinese 
government’s efforts to build a nationwide security surveillance system; and 3) 
its rising AI system integration can drive long-term ASP upside.

Business update  
Growth across its various product lines in 1H18 
 
Front-end products remain the largest revenue contributor (at 49%) 
and grew 21% YoY, slightly lower than the corporate average of 22%, 
owing to sales slowing down in the US/European markets. 
 
Back-end products contribute 14% of revenue and grew 16% YoY, 
along with the growth in front-end products. 
 
Central controlling equipment, at 13% of revenue, grew strongly at 
48% YoY, mainly driven by sales of data center and software products.  
 
The contribution from engineering construction increased to 5% due 
to its strong growth of 151% YoY, supported by the contribution from 
solution projects completion.  
 
The innovation business consists of Ezvits (the consumer surveillance 
camera), auto, robots and storage products. This business grew 80% 
YoY and contributed 5% of revenue in 1H18. Ezvits accounts for the 
bulk of the “innovation” business, with a sales contribution of over 
CNY700m, up 58% YoY.

Domestic market (70% of revenue): 1H18 domestic sales reached CNY14.6bn, 
up 27% YoY, a slightly deceleration from 31% YoY in 2017, due to 1) the small 
public security projects being squeezed by the Sharp Eyes/Sky Net projects, 
and 2) channels/clients inventory digestion, impacted by the Chinese 
government’s deleveraging policy. However, 1H18 GPM expanded to 45%, 
from 42% in 2017, thanks to 1) management’s continued efforts in realigning 
its internal employee KPI, and 2) the effort in channel optimization. The 
company expects the demand for industrial projects (except for public security) 
to remain stable and the deleveraging policy to lead to a healthier industry 
dynamic in the long term. 
Overseas market (30% of revenue): 1H18 overseas sales reached CNY6.3bn, 
up 27% YoY, a deceleration from 31% YoY in 2017, owing to instability from 
both a political and economic perspective. In addition, 1H18 GPM declined to 
44%, from 49% in 2017, given 1) the unfavorable forex, 2) product mix (higher

growth in low-margin standard products), and 3) more severe competition as 
global leading companies have aggressively cut prices to maintain shares.

Downside risks 
 
Market share loss to video surveillance peers would adversely affect 
sales and EPS estimates. 
 
Weaker orders from system integrators, value-added retailers, 
governments, and corporate clients would lead to lower shipments 
and earnings than we expect. 
 
Higher component costs or labor cost hikes in China.

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank 
may 
act 
as 
principal 
for 
its

account 
or 
as 
agent 
for 
another 
person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, 
perspectives or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. 
Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , 
and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company’s page. A Catalyst Call represents a 
high-conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector 
over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may 
occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the 
frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company-specific economic prospects make it 
difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the 
Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is 
provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial 
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial 
instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of 
the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and 
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are 
subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in 
exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are 
current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and 
other 
vendors.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income 
instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX 
depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by 
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons 
indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency 
that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks 
typical 
to 
options 
in 
addition 
to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax 
position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take 
expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed 
exchange controls, which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.  
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://research.db.com/Research/ on each company’s research page. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this 
information before investing.

been made consistent with the categories used by Analysts globally; and the effective time period for CCs has been 
reduced from a maximum of 180 days to 90 days.
