2Q18 miss on soft LCD panel price 
Key points 
 2Q NI was down 49% YoY to Rmb957m, leading 1H18 NI to 33% of our and the 
street’s 2018 estimate (vs. 1H17 tracked 57% of 2017 NI).   
 2Q GM was down to 17.6% (vs. 20.8% / 26.9% in 1Q18 / 2Q17). Opex ratio 
was slightly up to 12.6% (vs. 12.0% / 10.0% in 1Q18 / 2Q17). 
 We attribute the slow 2Q to soft panel price and expect a stronger 2H driven 
by better seasonality and stabilizing LCD panel price. 
 
Event 
 2Q miss, GM at 17.6% (Fig 1): 2Q revenues were -4% YoY to Rmb22bn, 
leading 1H18 revenues to 36% / 37% of our / street’s 2018 estimates (vs. 
1H17 tracked 48% of 2017 revenues). We attribute the miss to soft LCD panel 
prices, especially in TV, which was down 26% / 18% / 13% in 2Q18 for 32” / 
43” / 55” TVs. 2Q GM was 17.6% (vs. 20.8% / 26.9% in 1Q18 / 2Q17). The 
opex ratio was slightly up to 12.6% (vs. 12.0% / 10.0% in 1Q18 / 2Q17). Given 
the soft revenues, 2Q net income was down 49% YoY to Rmb957m, leading 
1H18 NI to 33% of our / street’s 2018 estimates (vs. 1H17 tracked 57% of 
2017 NI).           
Impact 
 Panel price trends have stopped falling but are likely to stay low: We believe 
LCD panel prices have stopped falling, but are likely to stay low given new capacity 
opening up and modest end demand. 32”/43”/55” TV panel prices are down 
24%/27%/15% YTD, while BOE continues capacity expansion on TV panels: 1) 
Gen-8.5 in Fuzhou reached full capacity in March 2018 with planned monthly 
capacity at 150K mother glass, for 43”/55” TVs, 2) Gen-10.5 in Hefei started mass 
production in March 2018, and targets to reach full capacity in 1H19, with planned 
monthly capacity at 120K mother glass, for 65” TVs, and 3) Gen-10.5 in Wuhan 
started construction in April 2018, and targets to start mass production in 2020, 
with planned monthly capacity at 120K mother glass, for 65”/75” TVs.   
 Flexible OLED, engine #2 in 2019E: We are positive on BOE’s flexible OLED 
business, given the largest capacity (three fabs with planned monthly capacity 
at 48K mother glass each) and the fastest roll-out (the Chengdu fab started 
mass production in October 2017), supporting BOE to gain market share in its 
home market, China. We expect rich China smartphone clients to accelerate 
the learning curve. We see flexible OLED as engine #2 in 2019E, with better 
price, less competition and GM upside, compared to the LCD panel market. 
Earnings and target price revision 
 We factor in 2Q18 results, and thus lower our 2018E EPS by 19%. We 
maintain our 2019-20E EPS. No change to our PT.  
Price catalyst 
 12-month price target: Rmb4.60 based on a PER method (13x 2019E PE). 
 Catalyst: 3Q18 results 
Action and recommendation 
 Maintain Outperform.
