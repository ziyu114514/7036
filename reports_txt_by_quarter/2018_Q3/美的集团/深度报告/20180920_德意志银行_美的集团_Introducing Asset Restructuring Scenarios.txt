Introducing Asset Restructuring
Scenarios
Event: News reports discuss potential outcomes of Midea-LS restructuring
An article from Xinhua News yesterday discussed a potential Midea-Little Swan
(LS) restructuring, which could include an asset injection and privatization. This
comes amid increasing concerns of a prolonged halt to the share trading. Against
this backdrop, we provide the following analysis and views: (1) We present four
scenarios for potential corporate action by Midea; (2) Yet, we continue to believe
it would be diﬃcult for any corporate action by Midea to drive synergy with LS,
given we view brand equity as the most signiﬁcant challenge. (3) We highlight
the key variable factors in this analysis, including: LS' B shares, government
holdings in LS, and growing investor concerns preventing Midea from prolonging
the suspension of trading.
Little Swan: (A-share: 000418.SZ, NR, RMB46.5) (B-share: 200418.SZ, NR,
HKD36.17)
Background
■
Midea is likely in full control of LS: Based on public disclosures, Midea
holds a 53% stake in LS (38% direct and 15% indirect), while Midea's
CEO, Paul Fang, is the chairperson of LS. After Midea's operations-center
reforms, we believe Midea has integrated its sales companies with LS'.
■
Frequent related-party transactions: Midea and LS record frequent
related-party transactions. We believe LS accounts for the majority of
Midea's washing-machine business (except for Toshiba washing-machine
assets; we derive this conclusion from reviewing public related-party
transaction disclosures). Also, LS holds the brand rights to Midea's
premium brand ("Beverly").
■
Trading halt and asset restructuring: Midea announced a trading halt
and potential asset restructuring with LS on 2018 September 9 (HKT),
the company originally planned to resume trading before September
11, citing it would resume trading soon after its board meeting.
However, Midea issued another announcement (dated 2018 September
12) indicating that it was prolonging the trading halt, and stating that it
would host a board meeting before September 28.

Midea
Based on the aforementioned news and our conversations with investors, we
present below four scenarios, as well as the potential impact on our Midea
investment case:
Scenario 1: Midea injects washing-machine assets into LS
■
Insignificant change to Midea's earnings, in our view: We estimate the
Toshiba washing-machine business accounts for less than 3% of Midea's
revenue, so this would have an minor impact.
Scenario 2: Midea increases holding in LS
■
Boost Midea's earnings (see Scenario 3 for calculations).
■
Unlikely to drive synergy, in our view: As Midea eﬀectively controls LS'
branding, products, manufacturing and channel, we see limited accretion
to synergy should Midea increase its holding in LS. We continue to
believe the major risk faced by Midea's washing-machine business is not
its eﬃciency, but weaker brand equity. The weakness is highlighted as
competitors (including the Casarte brand) branch into tier-3 cities with
increasingly competitive pricing .
Scenario 3: Midea privatizes LS
■
Boost Midea's earnings: Assuming Midea privatizes LS, this could
increase Midea's earnings by 3-5% (Figure 1).
■
Unlikely to drive synergy, in our view (see above)
■
Clean up the related-party transactions: This could help improve
corporate governance.
Scenario 4: Midea privatizes LS and distributes LS' net cash as a special
dividend to Midea shareholders
■
Boost Midea's earnings (see above)
■
Unlikely to drive synergy, in our view (see above)
■
Special dividend may add value to Midea's shareholders: Assuming
Midea privatizes LS and distributes all of LS' net cash to Midea
shareholders, this could lead to a special dividend of RMB2.1 per share
(or a 5% dividend yield, Figure 2)
■
It also may help reduce Midea's share pledges: We note that 10.1%
of Midea's outstanding shares are being pledged by Midea Holdings
(Midea's biggest shareholder, according to an announcement on June
22). As Midea's share-price declines, investors have expressed growing
concerns. If Midea Holdings uses the potential special dividend to
reduce its pledges, this could especially ease long-term value investors'
concerns. We note that some investors view heavy pledging as a
corporate governance red ﬂag.
Risks and variables to our four scenarios:
■
LS' B shares may increase the complexity of a potential privatization:
The B shares are denominated in HKD (although trading in Shenzhen).
We believe the currency translation and shareholder proﬁle of the B share
increases the complexity of a potential deal.

Midea
■
Government holding in LS: Based on LS' annual report, the Wuxi
government holds a 2.7% stake in the company. This may increase the
complexity for any potential corporate action by Midea on LS.
■
Investors and MSCI's attention to significant trading halt may
accelerate Midea's asset restructuring: Midea has released no timeline
on this potential restructuring. However, we believe Midea would need
to keep the halt to trading as short as possible. This is due to growing
concerns over a signiﬁcant trading suspension among investors, as well
as the MSCI.
Figure 1: Simulation: Midea's 2018E earnings to
increase 4% if it increased holding in LS to 100%
Figure 2: Simulation: assume LS sells its wealth-
management products and distributes the net cash to
Midea's shareholders

analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of
no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
