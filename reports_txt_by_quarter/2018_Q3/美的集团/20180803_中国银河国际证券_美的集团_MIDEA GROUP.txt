MIDEA GROUP [000333.CH] 
2018 H1 sales should be in line with full-year expectations in view of strong 
domestic demand for ACs, refrigerators, and washing machines. Slower 
growth is expected for KUKA and kitchen appliance sales. Notwithstanding 
new US tariffs, we expect Midea to see some improvement in export sales in 
2018 H2 and into 2019 due to RMB weakness. We reduce our target price 
from RMB67 to RMB63 to account for a softening macro backdrop and the 
delayed product launch of Midea’s high-end brand. 
 Investment Highlights 
AC sales expected to support 2018 H1. We expect Midea’s HVAC to grow 
~40% YoY, with refrigerator and washing machines growing ~20% YoY. 
Kitchen appliance growth is tracking in the single digits, as Midea prudently 
withheld shipments to distributors with high inventory levels in H1. KUKA is 
also experiencing lower-than-expected growth in Q2 because of the weak 
auto market, but is expected to deliver better results in H2.  
Trade war concerns overblown. In 2017, Midea exported ~US$2bn of 
goods to the US, or approximately 5% of overall sales. Of the Company’s 
US$2bn in exports, only US$200-250m may be affected by Trump’s first 
round of tariffs. Should Washington’s second round of tariffs come to fruition, 
we understand an additional ~US$400m of Midea exports would be affected. 
Midea’s exports to benefit from RMB depreciation. As one of China’s 
larger exporters of home appliances, the recent RMB weakness will support 
Midea’s exports, either through better price competitiveness or pricing power. 
However, the impact will be moderated by the fact that a significant portion 
of Midea’s international sales are produced in Brazil, Vietnam and other 
countries. We estimate that 5% RMB depreciation will benefit Midea’s 2019 
PBT by ~4%. 
Net Forex assets imply potential translation gain. As of Dec. 2017, 
Midea held RMB4bn of net USD exposure and ~RMB32bn of Euro debt 
exposure. We understand that most of its Euro debt is hedged, and estimate 
that single digit RMB depreciation from Dec. 2017 levels would result in 
minimal translation gain. 
Inexpensive Valuation. Currently trading at 11.8x 2019E PER, Midea is on 
track to deliver 10-15% revenue growth in 2018 H1, versus our full-year 
expectation of 14% growth. We trim our 2019 earnings by ~6% on account 
of i.) the delayed launch of Midea’s high-end brand, and ii.) a weaker macro 
backdrop, which may negatively impact 2019 estimates. Our new TP of 
RMB63 is based on 16x 2019 EPS, which we believe is justifiable for a 
business with a diversified franchise and earnings growth above 20%.

Net impact of Midea’s Forex Liabilities can be Material 
As of Dec. 2017, Midea’s forex cash and debt amounted to ~RMB13.4bn and ~RMB35.6bn, respectively. 
Much of this debt was Euro-denominated debt inherited from the KUKA acquisition, which we 
understand was mostly hedged. We estimate that Midea has forex exposure of ~RMB2.5bn. 
Consequently, Midea will be positively affected by weakness in the RMB exchange rate, though this 
translation gain will be booked to Midea’s other comprehensive income, and therefore will not affect 
reported earnings. Fluctuation in the EUR/USD exchange rate will also affect the gain. 
 
Nevertheless, as Figure 1 shows, a 5% depreciation of the RMB against the USD, Euro and other 
currencies since the beginning of the year will result in a translation loss of ~RMB 130m, or less than 1% 
of Midea’s 2018 PBT. Fluctuation in the EUR/USD exchange rate will affect the sensitivity.

Exports to Benefit from RMB Depreciation 
In 2017, Midea booked RMB104bn out of 241bn of sales in international markets. This figure 
included KUKA’s sales, as well as sales from Midea’s factories outside of China. Midea operates 
manufacturing plants in Brazil, Argentina, Italy, Belarus, Egypt, India, Thailand, Vietnam, and Japan. 
Direct sales to the US are only ~5% of Midea’s overall revenue, with most products going to the local 
markets in which they are produced. 
To adjust for these factors, we subtracted the impact of Kuka’s sales, and adjust for the fact that the 
remaining international sales are either local sales or priced in currencies which may not benefit from 
USD strength. According to our estimates, we see RMB depreciation of ~5% from Dec. 2017 levels 
benefiting Midea’s 2019 PBT by ~4%.
