MIDEA GROUP [000333.CH]: Margin expansion in 1H18 
Midea reported a strong set of interim results, with top/bottom line growing by 
15.0% / 19.7% respectively, led by strong results in air conditioning. While 
interim results were strong, investors are focused on potential deterioration in 
top line AC and consumer appliances during 2H18. We have cut our 2018 / 2019 
EPS by 3.7% / 10.4% and reduce our target price from RMB 63 to RMB 53 to 
account for softening top line growth and lack of near term positive catalysts. 
 Investment Highlights 
Upgrade trend intact: Midea’s gross margins increased from 25.5% in 1H17 to 
27.7% in 1H18, making it the only major appliance company to benefit from 
expanding gross margins in a rising raw material price environment (Figures 2-4). 
Midea expects gross margins to further improve in 2H18. 
Strong 1H but deteriorating momentum: Midea, Gree, and Qingdao Haier all 
experienced slipping AC sales growth in July due to high base effect and 
weather. All companies have indicated an improvement in August, consistent 
with our channel checks. Overall, however, we think weak July air conditioner 
sales and Little Swan’s Q3 2018 sales guidance for flat YoY growth may be a 
harbinger of tougher comps ahead. 
Low channel inventory: Midea’s AC inventory remains well controlled, with 1-2 
months of combined total factory and channel inventory, or approximately 5 
million units. In other appliance segments, Midea also reports that channel 
inventory is near historical lows. While we believe there is a high probability of 
revenue deceleration in 2H18, we don’t believe AC industry channel inventory 
levels are reminiscent of 2015 levels when destocking led to price wars. 
Presently, all three major appliance manufacturers report low channel 
inventories. 
Inexpensive valuation. While we cannot discount a slowdown in consumer 
demand in 2H18 and 2019, Midea is best positioned among all home 
manufacturers to weather a downturn. With ~35% sales from international 
sources (ex KUKA) and lower ASPs relative to Gree and Qingdao Haier, Midea 
remains well situated to ride out a slowdown in China’s home appliance market. 
Currently trading at 11.9x 2019E PER, we expect Midea to post 20%/11% EPS 
growth in 2018/2019, down from our former estimates of 25%/19% EPS growth. 
Our 2018/2019 earnings have been reduced by 3.7%/10.4% respectively. Our 
new TP is based on a valuation of 15x 2019 EPS, which we believe is justifiable 
for a business with a diversified franchise, stable market share, and teens 
earnings growth.
