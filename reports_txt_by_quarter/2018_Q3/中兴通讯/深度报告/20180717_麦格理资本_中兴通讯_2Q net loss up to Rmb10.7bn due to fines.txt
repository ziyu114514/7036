ZTE (A-Share) 
2Q net loss up to Rmb10.7bn due to fines 
Key points 
 ZTE guided a net loss of Rmb8.7bn~10.7bn in 2Q due to the suspension of 
major operating activities and US$1bn fine to strike an agreement w/the US. 
 The company has cleared another hurdle with a US$400m escrow 
agreement on July 12, the final step to remove the ban once completed. 
 We cut our TP to Rmb12.9 as we trim earnings in 2018/19/20E by 
420%/11%/4% to reflect the impact of the fines and operation suspension. 
 
Event 
 ZTE released 2Q18 guidance of a net loss of Rmb8.7bn~10.7bn vs a net profit 
of Rmb1.1bn in 2Q17, owing to the suspension of major operating activities 
and the US$1bn fine during the negotiation with the US in an attempt to 
remove the denial order (Trading resumes; US$1.4bn settlement, June 13). 
On July 12, the company signed an agreement for an additional US$400m 
escrow penalty, paving the way to resume operations (link). It is important to 
note that the ban will still be in place before the US issues a notice lifting 
the ban once the escrow deposit is completed. 
Impact 
 US$400m escrow penalty to be paid within 90 days from Jun 8: According 
to the previous settlement deal, ZTE must place US$400m of suspended 
penalty money in escrow within 90 days from Jun 8 in addition to the US$1bn 
fine before BIS will officially remove ZTE from the Denied Persons List. The 
US$1bn fine was booked in 2Q18 based on the company’s announcement 
while the company has also come to a detailed agreement with US on the 
escrow penalty, which marks the final step once the deposit is completed.  
 Management reshuffle with the new CEO in place: ZTE tapped an in-house 
executive with experience in product research and operations, Xu Ziyang, to 
be the new CEO as part of the settlement deal. Previously, Xu served as the 
CEO of ZTE’s German operations, at a time when the company signed a five-
year service contract with German telecoms operator E-Plus. Along with other 
key executive appointments, the new management team vows to uphold 
compliance as the top priority. 
Earnings and target price revision 
 We factor in 2Q guidance and cut earnings in 2018/19/20E by 420%/11%/4% 
further due to the fines and customers’ hanging concerns on the sustainability 
of the company. We lower our TP to Rmb12.9 (from Rmb29.0) on an updated 
PE multiple of 13x as a result, the trading average in the past three months.  
Price catalyst 
 12-month price target: Rmb12.90 based on 13x 2019E PER. 
 Catalyst: full 2Q18 results on Aug 23, the removal of the denial order. 
Action and recommendation 
 Maintain Neutral.
