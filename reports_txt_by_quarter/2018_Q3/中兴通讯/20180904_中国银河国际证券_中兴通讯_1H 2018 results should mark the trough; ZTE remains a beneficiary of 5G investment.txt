ZTE Corporation’s (ZTE) 1H 2018 results should mark the trough, and the Company is on track to 
recovery from the impact of the US ban on exports. Based on guidance for Q3 2018, ZTE’s opera-
tions are likely to return to a more normal level in Q4 2018. We have turned more positive on ZTE, as 
there should be no major provisions or related write-offs booked going forward. We also believe that 
ZTE will remain a major beneficiary of 5G investment in China and that the Company’s expansion to 
non-operator business is a medium-long-term growth driver. We believe that ZTE’s recovery was 
mainly driven by a pick-up in CAPEX by local telecom operators, and government and corporate 
business. The local telecom operators resumed equipment tenders recently, so telecom equipment 
suppliers, especially wireless names, should benefit after a challenging 1H 2018. However, the con-
sumer products segment is expected to lag behind, since it is more reliant on overseas markets. ZTE 
is committed to investing in new technologies, such as IoT, 5G, IC design, software-defined networks 
and high-end routers, which are growing areas in the telecommunications industry. We believe that 
market confidence in ZTE will be restored somewhat after the Q3 and Q4 2018 results. In addition to 
recovery in operating performance, news flow on 5G development in China is a major share price 
catalyst for ZTE. We maintain our BUY rating with a new target price of HK$18.67, based on 14x 
2019E PER, lower than the Company’s historical mean of 22x and lower than the industry average of 
16.3x. The downward revision is due to lower a PER multiple (cut from 23x to 14x) used. The target 
price for ZTE-A (000063.CH) is RMB21.55, based on a 17% premium to ZTE-H (Hang Seng Connect 
China AH Premium Index). We have a HOLD rating on ZTE-A. 
Investment Highlights 
1H 2018: Marked the trough. ZTE’s turnover dropped 27.0% YoY to RMB39,433.8m in 1H 2018. 
The Company reported a net loss of RMB7,824.2m in 1H 2018 vs. a net profit of RMB1,951.5m in 1H 
2017. The results were in line with the mid-point of previous guidance. Revenue for the carrier net-
work segment and consumer business reported a YoY decline  of 27% and 36%, respectively, in 1H 
2018. Revenue from government and corporate business grew 18% YoY in 1H 2018. The Company’s 
blended gross profit margin improved 2.6% YoY in 1H 2018 due to a higher contribution from the 
carrier network segment, which has a higher gross profit margin. The net loss in 1H 2018 was due 
mainly to business suspension and a penalty payment as a result of the US denial order. The penalty 
booked in 1H 2018 was RMB6.4bn, and there was an RMB2.5bn YoY increase in provisions and 
write-offs in 1H 2018. ZTE issued a profit alert for Jan-Sep 2018, which guided a net loss of 
RMB6.8bn-7.8bn. Based on announcement, ZTE is likely to report a net profit in Q3 2018, which 
indicates the Company is on the track to recovery.  
Local market potential to drive recovery. We share the view that the market might have con-
cerns about the growth outlook for ZTE, given the potential market share loss in overseas markets in 
both the equipment and consumer products segments. We believe that the consumer product seg-
ment will lag behind, but that the equipment and non-operator business, especially that related to 5G 
development in China, should drive recovery in Q4 2018 and 2019. We maintain the view that since 
5G is an area supported by the Chinese government, it will generate growth potential for equipment 
makers such as ZTE. In addition to wireless equipment, ZTE has invested in new technologies that 
allow Company to benefit from adoption of new technologies like NB-IoT.  
Outperformance to continue. ZTE outperformed recently, and we believe that the market is 
treating it as a proxy for 5G investment in China. We expect more news flow on 5G to emerge later 
this year and drive up shares of ZTE. ZTE’s outperformance is expected to continue as concerns 
gradually fade.
