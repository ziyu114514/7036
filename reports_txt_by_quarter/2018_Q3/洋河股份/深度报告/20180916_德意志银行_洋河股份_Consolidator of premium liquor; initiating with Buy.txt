Yanghe is the largest brand in premium liquor (Rmb300-600/bottle) in China. 
Near term, we expect its growth to be more resilient than other liquor brands, 
helped by its “value for money” nature, flat channels and rapid market 
response. Yanghe exhibited its resilience in the last downcycle in 2013-14. 
Long term, we expect it to consolidate the premium liquor sector through 
increased penetration and improved product mix. Risk/reward is attractive at 
15x 2019E P/E with a 22% earnings CAGR over FY18-20E. Initiate Buy. 
Premium liquor sector: fast-growing sales and improving consolidation 
The premium segment accounted for 9% of liquor volume and 20% of liquor 
sales in 2017. Premium liquor has good branding and reasonable pricing 
catered to the social and business demand. With middle-class consumers 
trading up, the premium segment is expected to have the highest growth 
among all categories in Baijiu, and estimated to have a 16% sales CAGR in 
2018-20 by Euromonitor. Meanwhile, in view of consumers’ increased brand 
awareness, we expect leading brands to gain market share in the segment.  
Yanghe: well positioned to scale up in the premium sector  
Yanghe takes a 30% market share by volume in the premium segment and we 
expect it to continue to consolidate the segment. Compared to other premium 
peers, Yanghe has a wider distribution channel, better brand awareness and 
more diversified products. Management also has high incentives with a 
significant interest in the company. We expect Yanghe to gain market share 
through increased penetration and improved product mix in the long term. 
Initiating with Buy; Target price RMB150 
Yanghe’s shares have fallen 30% (MSCI China staples index: -23%) since June due to 
weak market sentiment, but we believe the story of market share gains in the premium 
segment is intact. The stock trades at 15x 2019E P/E with a 22% earnings CAGR in 
2018-20E. We initiate on Yanghe with a Buy rating. Our target price of RMB150 is 
based on DCF (9.5% WACC and 2% terminal growth). Downside risk: macro 
slowdown, channel destocking of Moutai and food safety. (See pages 17 & 18).

Premium liquor: fast growing and 
improving consolidation 
Industry to witness a 16% CAGR in 2018-20E 
Liquor brands are normally categorized into four categories based on retail 
prices: low end, mid-range, premium, super premium, with per bottle/500ml 
price at <RMB100, RMB100-300, RMB300-600, and >RMB600 respectively 
(Figure 7). According to Euromonitor, the market size of the premium segment 
will register a 16% sales CAGR in the next three years, the highest among all 
categories (Figure 11).

Key driver of premium segment is growing income of middle-class consumers. 
Consumers are trading up for better quality liquor and brands, especially 
during social events such as marriage celebrations and gatherings. Meanwhile, 
due to the expanding poverty-rich gap, the trade-up trend is more prevalent in 
the premium and super-premium segments than in the low-end segment. 
Lastly, the premium segment has good branding and reasonable prices – 
“Feitian Moutai” is priced at RMB1,800, which is still overly expensive even for 
high income individuals.

 Industry consolidation to accelerate  
While the super-premium segment is highly concentrated (dominated by 
Moutai, Wuliangye and Luzhou Laojiao), the premium segment is still highly 
fragmented, with various local brands in each province. Yanghe is the lead 
brand but with only a 30% volume share and a 22% value share in the 
premium segment. The top five brands occupied a value share of only 54% in 
2017 (Figure 12). 
We forecast consolidation in the premium segment to accelerate in the next 
few years. First, consumers tend to buy better branded products aided by their 
increasing brand awareness. Second, leading brands’ product availability are 
increasing with improved channel penetrations. Third, leading brands have 
better resources in advertisement and promotion with operating leverage. We 
forecast the market share of the top five brands will increase to 66% in 2020 
from 54% in 2017.

Yanghe: a leader in the premium 
liquor segment  
Summary: outperforming peers in channels, branding and 
products  
Yanghe is the largest player in the premium segment (priced at RMB300-600 
per bottle) and the third-largest company by sales in China’s liquor industry. Its 
growth was the fastest among liquor name in 2007-17 (Figure 14). Yanghe 
derived more than 50% of sales from the premium segment in 2017. Yanghe’s 
leading position in the premium segment is helped by its strong channels, 
good branding and diversified products. We expect Yanghe to continue to 
consolidate the premium segment in the next three years.

Channels: wide, flat and efficient  
Different from most of its peers that have a long history, Yanghe’s main brand 
“Blue Classic”, which was launched in 2003, is a much younger make. For 
consumer companies with weaker brand awareness, channel penetration is 
usually adopted as a more straight forward method to push sales. As such, 
Yanghe has been actively building its channels since the launch of “Blue 
Classic”.  
Different from traditional liquor companies which mainly rely on large 
distributors, Yanghe’s distributing model is more skewed towards that of large 
FMCG companies (CRB, Tingyi, and Yili). Under this model, Yanghe’s 
salespersons are closely involved in retail end promotions, penetrating and 
obtaining orders, while distributors are mainly responsible for basic functions −

For example, Yanghe has more than 350 salespersons in Anhui. Prior to 2015, 
it focused on city-level markets before expanding to county-level areas. In 
Hefei, it covers 70% of liquor specialty stores with more than 30 salespersons 
and 40 promoters. Meanwhile, it classifies retailers into three categories, i.e., 
flagship stores, key stores and ordinary stores based on location, traffic and 
demand. Salespersons conduct in-store advertisement and promotions of 
different magnitudes. Through these measures, it achieved sales of RMB1.7bn 
in 2017 in Anhui. 
By the end of 2017, Yanghe had built a nationwide channel with over 5,000 
salespersons, 8,000 distributors, and 30,000 ground promoters. This channel 
covers 33 provinces and municipalities, including 330 cities and 2,582 
counties nationwide and boasting more than 2m of POS. Yanghe’s 
salesperson and distributor numbers are significantly higher than those of 
other leading liquor brands (Moutai, Wuliangye, Laojiao and Fen wine).

Such in-depth distribution model helps Yanghe achieve high sales growth and 
react fast to retail ends. This model enabled Yanghe to achieve a sales CAGR 
of 27% in 2007-17 (Figure 14), the highest growth among the liquor companies 
in China. Meanwhile, with a flat distribution network, Yanghe’s management is 
able to react fast to retail ends. For example, during the liquor sector’s de-
stocking cycle in 2012-2014, Yanghe’s sales declined by 15%, whereas that of

Branding: well positioned and increasing awareness  
Although Yanghe’s main brand “Blue Classic” is relatively new -- launched in 
2003 -- it has become a leading brand through niche positioning and efficient 
branding investment. Its key product “Blue Classic” series has the slogan “The 
sea is the world’s largest, but the sky is deeper than the sea; yet men’s 
sentiment is more profound than the sky” (世界上最宽广的是海，比海更高远的是
天空，比天空更博大的是男人的情怀)”. The slogan reflects Yanghe’s “consumer-
oriented” culture – it aims to communicate directly with consumers and share 
the aspirations of consumers, whereas other premium liquor brands focus 
more on connecting their brand names with culture, patriotism and luxury. This 
niche positioning differentiates Yanghe from other brands and enhance 
consumer awareness, in our view.

Meanwhile, the “Blue Classic” brand awareness has continued to improve, 
helped by the company’s high A&P spending and efficient usage. Yanghe 
spent RMB1.2bn in 2017 on A&P expense, lower than that for its super-
premium brand but higher than all other premium brands (Figure 20). It 
displays the brand in various out-door areas. It sponsors various TV programs

In our view, the “Yanghe” brand has grown to become a top premium brand. 
It had similar rankings as Moutai and Wuliangye in “BrandZ top 100” and 
“Brand Finance Spirits 50” in 2017-18, outperforming other mid- to high-end 
peers such as Fen Wine, Gujing Distillery and King’s Luck in terms of brand

Products: less inherited, but more innovative 
Yanghe’s products are innovative, which fits the changing demand trend of 
consumers. Moutai and Wuliangye’s flagship products “Feitian Moutai” and 
“Wuliangye crystal bottle” have maintained consistent tastes − almost 
unchanged for more than 50 years. However, Yanghe’s “Blue Classic” series is 
evolving as it specifically designs its products to meet consumer taste 
preferences. Yanghe underwent 4,325 of consumer tasting tests before it 
launched the “Blue Classic” series in 2003. Based on the tasting results, it 
positions “Blue Classic” as a mellow taste beverage, with a specifically sweet, 
mellow, soft, clear and fragrant taste. This differs from traditional liquor that 
focuses on aroma.  
Some investors argue Yanghe’s innovative beverages do not offer as much 
moat as that of traditional brands, but we believe this is necessary for long-
term growth (similar for other FMCG products). Consumer tastes evolve over 
years. For example, ‘yellow’ wine was a mainstream alcoholic drink during the 
Qing Dynasty and in the early 20th century. This changed to baijiu after 1949. 
We believe liquor companies need to keep their product tastes updated to see 
sustainable growth. Yanghe’s culture of innovation should make it more 
resilient to changing consumer tastes in the long term.  
“Weifenzi” is another example of innovation. Low alcohol content baijiu is now 
a trend due to consumers’ growing health consciousness. According to the 
Ministry of Commerce, consumers in higher-income regions (such as 
Guangdong and Jiangsu) prefer low-alcohol baijiu. Accordingly, Yanghe 
launched ‘Weifenzi’ baijiu to meet this trend in 2014. “Weifenzi” is a low-
alcohol baijiu but tastes the same as a high-alcohol baijiu. The low-alcohol 
baijiu contains nucleotides analogues, which protects the liver. Although 
‘Weifenzi’ has not contributed meaningful sales, it is a good trial and reflects 
Yanghe’s innovation culture.

Resilient growth with high 
visibility  
Summary: new regions, product mix upgrades, and new 
category to drive growth 
Although Yanghe has become the third-largest liquor company by sales, its 
major sales is still derived from Jiangsu. It also derives around 50% of sales 
from mid-range products. We see a great potential for Yanghe to achieve sales 
growth through geography expansion and product mix upgrades. More 
importantly, it has high growth visibility, as we believe Yanghe can easily 
replicate the successful experience in Jiangsu in other regions. We forecast a 
22% sales CAGR in 2018-20E.  
Geography: penetrating from Jiangsu to new Jiangsu  
Yanghe is headquartered in Suqian, a city in Jiangsu. It derived 53% of sales 
from Jiangsu in 2017. Following its success in increasing penetration in 
Jiangsu, management is now allocating more resources to other provinces. It 
targets to increase the sales portion from non-Jiangsu markets to 70% in 2020, 
implying the non-Jiangsu segment could grow at least 30% faster than the 
Jiangsu region.  
Yanghe’s focused markets are mainly in regions closed to Jiangsu, including 
Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Zhejiang and Hubei. These regions have sizable 
market potential while competition is not as intensive as that in traditional 
liquor regions such as Sichuan and Guizhou. Except in Anhui and Zhejiang, 
there are no listed liquor brands in these regions and local liquor names mostly 
focus on the mid- to low-end categories. These regions have a total population 
of 374m, which is 4.6 times of Jiangsu, and the overall per cap income is 
similar to Jiangsu’s (Figure 25).  
Yanghe launched a “new Jiangsu market” strategy to expand its new market 
in 2014. The strategy refers to potential markets in county and city levels that 
could contribute meaningful revenue (annual sales should be over RMB8m for 
county-level markets and over RMB15m for city-level markets). Until 1Q18, 
there were 495 “new Jiangsu markets” which contributed 70% of Jiangsu 
revenue. According to management, it will replicate its successful model in 
Jiangsu in the new Jiangsu markets.

Considering Yanghe’s strong branding, channel operation and diversified 
products, we believe the strategy will be successful. On branding, Yanghe’s 
“Blue classic” has better brand awareness than most local brands in the 
premium segment, and it is able to spend higher advertisement dollars in 
future, helped by its large scale. On channel, Yanghe’s successful experience in 
in-depth model, channel profit allocation and execution could be replicated in 
new regions. On product, given its key products are from the mid-range to 
premium segments, we believe Yanghe has flexibility to penetrate into new 
markets based on local consumption.  
We forecast Yanghe’s sales from non-Jiangsu markets will record a 36% CAGR 
from RMB9.3bn in 2017 to RMB23.3bn in 2020, and expect this to contribute 
65% of its total sales in 2020.

Product mix: moving up from mid-range to premium 
segment 
Yanghe has a diversified product portfolio, comprising mid-range, premium 
and super-premium, with “Sea Blue”, ”Sky Blue”, and “Dream Blue M3” priced 
at RMB150, RMB300, and RMB500 (all with a 52% alcoholic content) 
respectively. It also has super-premium SKUs such as “Dream Blue M9” and 
“Dream Blue Shou Gong Ban” priced at RMB1,699 and RMB1,788 respectively 
(Figure 30). In 2017, “Sea Blue”, “Sky Blue”, and “Dream Blue” accounted for 
30%, 20% and 22% of total sales respectively.  
Yanghe’s historical growth indicates a mix upgrade trend. Yanghe’s key 
products “Dream Blue”, “Sky Blue” and “Sea Blue” are positioned as premium, 
mid-premium and mid-range, respectively (Figure 30). Its sales growth was 
driven, in order, by “Sea Blue” from 2004 (80% CAGR in 2004-11), “Sky Blue” 
from 2008 (70% in 2008-12), and “Dream Blue” from 2017 (50% yoy in 2017).  
Sales contributions from “Sea Blue” declined from 46% in 2007 to 30% in 2017 
and from “Dream Blue” increased from 2% in 2007 to 22% in 2017. We 
forecast the sales portion of “Dream Blue” will continue to increase to 35% in 
2020.

For the next three year, we expect the premium segment to be the fastest 
growing category for Yanghe:  
 
Consumers’ growing income continues to drive premium products 
demand. Our channel checks indicate that the mainstream price range 
for social dining in south Jiangsu has moved up to over RMB300-500 
from RMB100-300 before 2016. 
 
Yanghe is pushing premium products through allocating more A&P 
expense and providing more channel incentives. Meanwhile, as 
Yanghe’s “Sea/Sky/Dream” series are sub brands of “Blue classic”, 
consumers could easily move from “Sea” to “Sky”, and from “Sky” to 
“Dream” when they have a higher budget. 
 
The retail price hikes of super-premium brands Moutai, Wuliangye and 
Guojiao 1573’s since 2017 should result in lesser competition for 
premium products.  
We forecast Yanghe’s sales proportion from “Dream Blue” to increase from 
20% in 2017 to 35% in 2020. This will contribute RMB8bn incremental sales 
from 2017 and lead to a 2ppt gross margin expansion in 2017-20E.  
Strong balance sheet supports long-term diversification  
In its 2017 annual report, Yanghe indicated its aspiration to become a leading 
company in the alcohol industry, implying it will not limit its sales to the current 
category of aromatic flavor liquor. True to its words, it acquired 12.5% interest 
in VSPT Group, the second-largest wine brand in Chile, in 2018. 
We have not factored in potential growth of these new categories, as 
management remains focused on growth from its new Jiangsu markets and 
product mix upgrades in the near term. However, we see long-term growth 
potential for Yanghe. With RMB16bn of cash/finance asset on book, Yanghe 
could continue to expand through M&As in the long term.

Financial forecast 
2018E: 25% sales growth and 28% earnings growth 
We forecast Yanghe to report 25% sales growth in 2018, driven by: 1) 10% 
volume growth, mainly contributed by its non-Jiangsu market expansion and 
stable volume in Jiangsu; and 2) an estimated 13% ASP increase due to 
product mix upgrades and price hikes in 1Q and 3Q. Management has guided 
for 20% sales growth in 2018 (its historically growth has outperformed its 
guidance in the past, except in 2013-14) (Figure 33).  
We forecast Yanghe to report 28% earnings growth in 2018, with 70bps yoy 
net margin improvement. This is driven by an estimated 30bps gross margin 
expansion helped by ex-factory price hikes and product mix change, and an 
estimated 140bps decline in SG&A/sales benefited from operation leverage. 
Our 2018 forecast implies 24% sales growth and 27.7% earnings growth in 
2H18. 
2019-20E: 20% sales CAGR and 22% earnings CAGR 
We forecast a 20% sales CAGR for Yanghe from RMB24.9bn in 2018 to 
RMB35.8bn in 2020, mainly driven by:  
 
10.5% volume CAGR over the same period, helped by a CAGR of over 30% 
in non-Jiangsu markets and likely flat growth in the Jiangsu province. 
 
9% ASP CAGR over the same period, a result of continued product mix 
upgrades and higher sales proportion from non-Jiangsu markets, where 
the ASP is usually higher than that in Jiangsu due to different product mix. 
We expect Yanghe’s net margin to expand from 34% in 2018 to 35.4% in 
2020, driving net profit to register a 22.3% CAGR, from RMB8.5bn in 2018 to 
RMB12.7bn in 2020E. The margin expansion is attributable to a likely 150bps 
improvement in gross margin and a 50bps saving in SG&A. 
For cash conversion cycle, we estimate its inventory turnover days will 
continue to decline from 584 days in 2017 to 520 days in 2020, helped by 
improved inventory management. We expect the number of AR turnover days 
to maintain stable at 3, while AP days to return to its long-term average of 
more than 100.

Valuation and risks 
Initiating with Buy; TP at RMB150  
We use a DCF methodology to derive our 1-year target price of RMB150, 
factoring in 9.5% WACC (3.9% risk free rate, 5.6% equity risk premium, 1.0x 
beta, debt free structure) and 2% terminal growth, which is in line with other 
staple companies under our coverage. The methodology is same with most 
staple companies under our coverage, and we think the company’s future cash 
flow has enough visibility. We initiate with Buy. 
Our 1-year target price implies an 18x 2020E PE, or a 0.65x PEG based on its 
net profit CAGR at 24% in 2018-20E. This is in line with other listed baijiu peers 
at PEG of 0.64. The target PE is also in line with Yanghe’s average of 17x 
forward P/E in the past nine years. Meanwhile, given Yanghe has better 
visibility compared to a few years ago, a national distribution network and a 
well-established branding, we think it is fair to trade at higher valuations.

Risks 
Food safety risk  
Food safety is always a big concern for food & beverage companies. A food 
safety incident could harm the company’s reputation, reduce its sales, and 
cause a collapse in stock prices. In November 2012, Jiu Gui Liquor reportedly 
had plasticizer contained in its products which was 2.6x higher than standards 
based on the test results of Shanghai Intertek. The incident caused the entire 
baijiu segment to witness a stock price collapse the next day. Although no 
baijiu companies were punished, if such incidents were to happen again, there 
would be adverse impacts on stock prices.  
Government policy change  
Since the central government put forward an eight-point rule in 2012, local 
governments have implemented strict control on entertainment consumption 
of liquor. In 2017, several local governments tightened the regulation, with 
some banning liquor consumption. Although we have seen baijiu consumption 
moved from government to business entities, the government may still 
implement more adverse policies on baijiu consumption, which could lead to 
another de-stocking cycle.  
Consumer preference shift  
Yanghe’s major business is producing and selling baijiu. Due to consumers’ 
increasing health consciousness and changing preferences, consumers may 
choose other beverages to replace baijiu, which could lead to an overall 
decline in the whole industry. 
Macro FAI slowdown  
Macro fixed asset investment growth is correlated with FMCG consumption. A 
growth slowdown could dampen consumer confidence and consumption 
capability, leading to lower demand.

Company background 
Company description.  
Headquartered in Suqian, Jiangsu Province, Yanghe Brewery is a national 
large-scale liquor production enterprise in China with two major liquor brands 
“Yanghe” and “Shuanggou”. The company was established in 2002 by Yanghe 
Group and listed on the Shenzhen Stock Exchange in 2009. In 2017, Yanghe 
achieved total sales of RMB19.9bn, which ranked third in China’s liquor 
industry. 
Restructured to a mixed ownership from 2002 
Yanghe is one of the few liquor companies that completed a mixed ownership 
reform at early stages. Its reform mainly included two stages:  
 
In 2002, Yanghe was established by Jiangsu Yanghe Group (100% 
controlled by the local government), six distributors, institutional 
investors, and 14 senior management members. Yanghe Group and 
management held 51.1% and 8.41% interest in Yanghe, respectively. 
 
In 2006, Yanghe issued new shares to Blue Sky Trading and Blue Sea 
Trading, both of which were owned by the management team. This 
diluted the local government’s stake to 38.61%, and the management 
team together held 30.79%.  
In 2009, Yanghe completed its IPO and issued 45m new share priced at 
RMB60/share. After the IPO, the local government and management team’s 
(existing and old) stakes were diluted to 34.05% and 27.72%, respectively. 
Currently, the government and the management team own 34.16% and 
22.63% (including the shareholding by Jiangsu Blue Alliance) equity of the 
company, respectively.  
Yanghe’s mixed ownership reform is much earlier than most large listed liquor 
companies. The management team also has a higher stake in the listed 
company. (Figure 44). We believe mix ownership is the core reason for 
Yanghe’s entrepreneur culture, which leads to its innovative products, in-depth 
channel and highly efficient operations. We expect Yanghe’s growth to 
outperform its peers with this aligning management interest.

party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank 
may 
act 
as 
principal 
for 
its 
own 
account 
or 
as 
agent 
for 
another 
person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, 
perspectives or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers 
it writes on. Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. 
Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , 
and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company’s page. A Catalyst Call represents a 
high-conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector 
over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may 
occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the 
frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company-specific economic prospects make it 
difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the 
Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is 
provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial 
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial 
instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of 
the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and 
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are 
subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in 
exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are 
current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and 
other 
vendors.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income 
instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX 
depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by 
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons 
indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency 
that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks

movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax 
position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take 
expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed 
exchange controls, which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.  
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://research.db.com/Research/ on each company’s research page. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this 
information before investing.
