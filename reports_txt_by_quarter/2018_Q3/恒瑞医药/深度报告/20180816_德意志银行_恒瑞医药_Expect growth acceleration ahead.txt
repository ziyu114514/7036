Expect growth acceleration ahead
Solid quarter; the beat, inline and the miss
Hengrui registered sales/core proﬁt of RMB3.9bn/924m in 2Q18, representing YoY
growth of 23%/21%. This suggests acceleration from 22%/12% growth achieved
in 1Q18. Core proﬁt would reach RMB2.0bn with 29% YoY growth (apple to apple
comparison) in 1H18, if we were to exclude stock compensation expense and
investment income from ﬁnancial products. The company indicated 15-20%, 30%,
21% and stable growth for oncology, anesthetics, contrast agents and export
business respectively for 1H18.
■
What's beat? GM improved to 86.7% from 86.4%, which is partially due
to VAT reduction. We do not think this will continue for 2H18 as price cut
may oﬀset this.
■
What are inline? revenue growth, SBC and OPM are largely inline.
■
What missed? We estimate apatinib sales were around RMB830m,
representing 16% YoY growth which is below street expectation of
40-50% growth, and 45% growth per Rx data.
■
What's ahead of us in 2H18? 1) SBC (stock based compensation) expense
was RMB161m in 1H18 while full year budget is 187m, as such NP shall
have a better base for 2H18; 2) apatinib weakness should have been
reﬂected in consensus due to NRDL inclusion of Avastin and anlotinib
launch. We expect downward adjustment of peak sales estimate of
consensus; 3) signiﬁcant GM expansion is unlikely until after multiple new
drug launches in 2019, as price cuts of oncology drugs may oﬀset the
upside.
Adjust target price to RMB85.5 from RMB85.8; risks
We believe recent stock weakness represents an enhanced opportunity to buy,
as the gap between Hengrui and other bellwethers has become wider based on
recent pipeline progress, in our view. Our PT is based on 64x 2019E EPS. We
believe Hengrui deserves a premium on the multiple given the superior value of
its products and its strong pipeline, and its A-share peers are trading at 31x 2019E
EPS with 19% growth in 2020 (vs. 25% we model for Hengrui). Key risks include
regulatory delays, setback in gastric and ESCC for PD-1, as well as price cut and
competition.

Apatinib sales might have missed DBe and consensus
Management did not oﬀer color on apatinib sales. Our current estimate of
RMB830m is lower than RMB1.2bn modelled previously for 1H18. This represents
16% YoY growth only. As we believe volume growth shall accelerate after NRDL
inclusion, three negative elements also worked simultaneously, including 36%
price cut, the NRDL inclusion of Avastin and the launch of anlotinib.
Apatinib sales number is an important data point with multiple complications.
First, the data point itself is a stock driver, even the signiﬁcance is decreasing
as multiple new drugs would be launched soon. However we believe consensus
expected 40-50% YoY growth as Rx data indicated 45-50% growth in 5mYTD18;
secondly, if sales were below expectation, this would lead to another question
why. The most rational explanation could be a smaller-than-expected near-
term addressable market vs. consensus in our view, if we would exclude other
elements (such as capacity issues, inventory stocking, destocking etc) which the
street has no visibility with.
As we ponder the most pertinent counter-argument whether peak sales of
apatinib should be revised down, we construe it would be slow implementation
of NRDL and potential longer than expected duration of NRDL beneﬁt. However
both elements remain uncertain to us, while missing our/consensus expectation
already occurred.

with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
