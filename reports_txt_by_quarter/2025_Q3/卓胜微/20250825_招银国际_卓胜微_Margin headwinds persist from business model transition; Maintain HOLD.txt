Maxscend (300782 CH) - Margin 
headwinds persist from business 
model transition; Maintain HOLD
Margin headwinds persist from business model 
transition; Maintain HOLD 
 
Maxscend released 2Q25 results. Revenue was RMB948mn in 2Q25, up 25% 
QoQ from a low base in 1Q but down 13% YoY, reflecting continued softness in 
end-market demand and intensified competition. During the period, GPM fell to 
27% (-4ppt/-14ppt vs. 1Q25/2Q24) in 2Q25, missing BBG consensus estimates 
of 34%, due to 1) ongoing price pressure, 2) impact from depreciation, and 3) 
lower-than-expected fab utilization. Net loss widened to RMB101mn in 2Q (NLM: 
-11%) from -RMB47mn in 1Q (NLM: -6%). We cut our 2025/26E revenue 
forecasts by 21%/22% to reflect weaker-than-expected demand and persistent 
pricing pressure. We also lower GPM projections by 9ppts/7ppts to 32%/37% in 
2025/26E, factoring in near-term margin headwinds from elevated depreciation. 
Maintain HOLD with TP of RMB81.5.  
 Revenue declined on soft demand, while product development 
progress stayed intact. China’s smartphone shipment grew 3.3% YoY in 
1Q25 on government subsidies but decreased 4%/4% YoY/QoQ in 2Q as 
demand fell. The weak recovery in market demand (2025 smartphone 
shipment to grow by 0.6%/1.9% YoY, per IDC/Counterpoint) and slower-
than-expected industry consolidation weighed on Maxscend’s performance. 
1H25 sales dropped 25% YoY, although RF modules now accounted for 44% 
of total revenue, up from 36%/42% in FY23/24. This shift demonstrates the 
company’s progress in product development (i.e., L-PAMiD, equipped with 
in-house MAX-SAW, reflecting a fully localized supply chain). We expect  
module revenue to exceed 50% of total sales in 2027E, aligning with industry 
modularization and localization trends. However, without a strong rebound 
in demand, we expect Maxscend’s overall revenue to decrease by 9% in 
2025E. 
 Margin headwinds persist. Maxscend booked a D&A expense of 
RMB323mn in 1H25, up 22% YoY from RMB265mn in 1H24. Although 
depreciation growth may have peaked, absolute expense is expected to 
remain elevated in the near term as the company ramps up its 12-inch IPD 
line (1H25 capacity: 5kwm). We think improved fab utilization across the 6-
inch and 12-inch lines should help ease margin pressure over time. We 
expect overall GPM to be 32% in 2025, given ongoing margin erosion as fab 
ramps up. 
 Maintain HOLD. We see 2025-26E as transitioning years for Maxscend. Our 
new TP is based on 45x 2026E EV/EBITDA (vs. prior 45x 2026E P/E), 
slightly higher than 0.5-SD below 5-year historical avg. of 44x, reflecting 
ongoing business model shift toward fab-lite/IDM. While Maxscend is well-
positioned in the RFFE market and China’s localization, we think its margin 
recovery may take another year. Upside catalysts: stronger-than-expected 
recovery, accelerated localization. Potential downside risks: slower capacity 
ramp-up, R&D delays.
