Shengyi Tech (600183 CH) 
 
 
 
Strong 1H25 results underscore AI-driven 
strength  
 
Shengyi Tech announced its 1H25 preliminary earnings. The company 
projected 1H25 NP to surge by 50%-56% YoY, reaching RMB1.40bn-
RMB1.45bn. 2Q NP alone is estimated to be RMB836mn-RMB886mn, implying 
55%-64% YoY/48%-57% QoQ growth, and exceeding Bloomberg consensus of 
RMB611mn by 37%-45%. The strong results were driven by 1) volume growth of 
CCL products, 2) surging PCB sales (85%-97% YoY in 1H25) and 3) GPM 
increase from a favorable product mix. Reiterate BUY on Shengyi Tech as the 
company is one of the key beneficiaries in the global AI supply chain (report). TP 
is revised up to RMB41.1. 
 Surging PCB sales underscore AI-driven strength. The company’s PCB 
subsidiary Shengyi Electronics (688183 CH, NR) also released prelim. 1H25 
results, projecting revenue growth of 85%-97% YoY to RMB3.7bn-
RMB3.9bn, and NP growth of 432%-471% YoY to RMB511-549mn. Shengyi 
Electronics has showed sequential growth in 2Q. Its latest quarterly sales 
are estimated to be RMB2.1bn-RMB2.3bn, showing 90%-111% YoY/31%-
46% QoQ growth (following 5% QoQ growth in 1Q). 2Q NP is guided to be 
RMB311mn-RMB349mn, with 346%-401% YoY and 56%-75% QoQ 
increases. We believe that such strong performance is supported by resilient 
AI-driven demand and further product mix enhancement, which together 
drove margin expansion and earnings acceleration.  
 Margin continues to improve, which may offset the rising copper cost 
headwinds. Shengyi Tech’s mgmt. sees GPM increase in its CCL business, 
driven by optimization in product structure. In addition, NPM of Shengyi’s 
PCB segment continues to recover, with mid-point NPM rising to 15.1% in 
2Q25 vs. 12.7%/6.4% in 1Q25/2Q24. Meanwhile, we have observed that 
rising copper price appears to be headwinds to its PCB segment. Copper 
price remains at its high level at above US$9.6k/tonne during the month. The 
material cost pressure may sustain in our view, primarily attributable to the 
tariffs and growing demand from AI/data centers, auto and etc. However, we 
think Shengyi Elec. will manage the impact, as it focuses on high value 
products and has strengthened its competitiveness in the mid- to high-end 
market.  
 Reiterate BUY with TP raised to RMB41.1 based on 30x 2025E P/E (vs. 
30.6x prev.), close to 1-SD above its 5-yr hist. forward P/E. We raise our 
revenue/NP growth forecasts to 39%/92% YoY in 2025 on higher volume 
sales and better GPM. We think the valuation is justified as the company is 
experiencing upcycle and robust growth (revenue/NP to grow). Key risks 
include: slower-than-expected capacity ramp-up, intensified competition, 
geopolitical uncertainties, etc.
