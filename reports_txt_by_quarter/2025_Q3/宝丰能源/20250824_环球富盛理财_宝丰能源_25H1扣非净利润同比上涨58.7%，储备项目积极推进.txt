新项目顺利投产，新产能贡献显著。一是内蒙260 万吨/年煤制烯烃及配套40 万吨/年绿氢耦合制烯烃项目按
计划建成投产并全面达产，上半年生产聚烯烃116.35 万吨，占公司聚烯烃总产量的48.39%。该项目是目前为
止全球单厂规模最大的煤制烯烃项目，也是首个规模化应用绿氢与现代煤化工协同生产工艺制烯烃的项目。
该项目建成后，公司烯烃产能已达到520 万吨/年，产能规模跃居我国煤制烯烃行业第一位。内蒙烯烃项目示
范应用了多项具有我国自主知识产权的大国重器设备，设备国产化率超过98%，项目采用最先进的DMTO-Ⅲ
技术，依托项目的区位优势、技术优势及投资优势，公司烯烃生产成本进一步降低，核心竞争力进一步增强。
二是10 万吨/年醋酸乙烯项目实现一次性开车成功并顺利投产，实现了EVA 装置主要原料自主供应，保障了
主要原料的质量和稳定供应，为企业产业链协同发展与成本优化奠定了坚实基础。三是OCC 装置实现一次性
开车成功，产出产品各项指标全部合格。 
⚫ 
在建项目进展顺利，储备项目积极推进。一是宁东四期烯烃项目于2025 年4 月开工建设，且项目建设进展顺
利，截至7 月底，设计到图率24%，设备订货率达80%，土建基础施工完成80%，土建主体框架施工完成
35%，钢结构已全面开始图纸深化及加工制作，该项目计划于2026 年底建成投产。二是新疆烯烃项目、内蒙
二期烯烃项目前期工作正在积极推进。 
⚫ 
盈利预测。我们预计公司2025-2027 年归母净利润分别为118.12 亿元、129.95 亿元和141.06 亿元。考虑到
同行业可比公司估值，我们给予公司2025 年12 倍PE，对应目标价为19.32 元，维持给予“买入”评级。

Summary 
➢ 
In 2025H1, recurring net profit increased by 58.7% YoY. In 25H1, the company's operating revenue 
increased by 35.0% YoY to 22.82 billion yuan; the net profit increased by 73.0% YoY to 5.72 billion 
yuan; and the recurring net profit increased by 58.7% YoY to 5.58 billion yuan. In 2025Q2, the 
company's operating revenue was 12.05 billion yuan (YoY +39.0%); net profit was 3.28 billion yuan 
(YoY +74.2%); and net profit was 2.98 billion yuan (YoY +46.6%). In 2025H1, the company's main 
product, polyolefin (including EVA), had a production capacity of 2.4046 million tonnes (YoY +96.64%). 
The coke production capacity was 3.418 million tonnes, which was basically the same YoY. 
➢ 
The new project has been successfully implemented, with significant contributions from the new 
production capacity. The Inner Mongolia 2.6 million tonne/year coal-to-olefin project, which supports the 
production of 400,000 tonnes/year of green hydrogen-coupled olefin, has been completed and is 
operating as planned, having fully reached production capacity. In the first half of the year, the project 
produced 1,163,500 tonnes of polyolefin, accounting for 48.39% of the company's total polyolefin 
production. It is currently the world's largest single-plant coal-to-olefin project, and the first to use green 
hydrogen and modern coal chemical collaborative production technology to produce olefins on a large 
scale. Following completion of the project, the company's olefin production capacity reached 5.2 million 
tonnes per year, making it the largest in China's coal-to-olefin industry. The Inner Mongolia olefin 
project demonstrates the application of multiple large-scale pieces of heavy machinery with 
independent intellectual property rights in China, with a localisation rate of over 98%. Adopting the most 
advanced DMTO-III technology, the project leverages its location, technological and investment 
advantages to further reduce production costs and enhance core competitiveness. Secondly, the 
100,000-tonne-per-year vinyl acetate project achieved a successful one-time start-up and smooth 
production. This realises an independent supply of the main raw materials for the EVA unit, ensuring 
their quality and stable supply, and laying a solid foundation for the coordinated development of the 
enterprise's industrial chain and cost optimisation. Thirdly, the OCC device achieved a successful one-
time start-up and produced products with all indicators meeting the required standards. 
➢ 
The ongoing projects are progressing smoothly and the reserve projects are being actively promoted. 
Construction of the Ningdong Phase IV olefin project began in April 2025, and is progressing well. As of 
the end of July, 24% of the design drawings had been completed, 80% of the equipment had been 
ordered, 80% of the civil foundation construction had been completed, 35% of the civil main frame 
construction had been completed, and the steel structure had fully started the production of drawings 
for further development. The project is planned for completion and operation by the end of 2026. 
Secondly, the preliminary work on the Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia Phase II olefin projects is actively 
underway. 
➢ 
Profit forecast: We expect that the company's net profit in 2025-2027 will be 11.81 billion yuan, 13.00 
billion yuan, and 14.11 billion yuan. Considering the valuation of comparable companies in the same 
industry, we have given the company PE of 12x for 2025, which corresponds to TP of RMB19.32. We 
initiate with the company with a "Buy" rating. 
➢ 
Risk warning. The project's progress is slower than expected, and demand from downstream is lower 
than expected.
