WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) - 
Impressive growth amid 
uncertain environment
Impressive growth amid uncertain environment 
 
WuXi AppTec reported better-than-expected 1H25 results, with revenue 
increasing by 20.6% YoY (including 24.2% YoY growth for continuing operations) 
and adj. non-IFRS net profit surging by 44.4% YoY.  Revenue from continuing 
operations and adj. non-IFRS net profit accounted for 47.5% and 54.4%, 
respectively, of our full-year forecasts, both higher than the historical ranges. 
WuXi AppTec delivered strong operational execution, despite ongoing macro 
uncertainties. As such, mgmt. raised its full-year guidance for 2025, expecting 
revenue of continuing operations to grow by 13-17% (vs prior guidance of 10-
15%) and adj. non-IFRS net profit margin to expand in 2025.  
 Robust commercial demand drives CDMO outperformance.  The robust 
demand for late-stage clinical and commercial manufacturing has been a key 
growth driver for the global CXO industry in the post-COVID era. As a global 
leader in the chemical drug CDMO sector, WuXi AppTec has substantially 
benefited from this trend. In 1H25, its TIDES revenue surged by 141.6% YoY 
thanks to faster-than-expected manufacturing capacity ramp-up. Mgmt raised 
its full-year guidance for TIDEs revenue growth from 60% to 80%. Revenue 
from small molecule D&M grew by 17.5% YoY, marking a notable rebound 
from the negative growth seen in 2023/2024. In addition, the volatilities in US-
China tariffs seemed to have limited impact to the Company’s first half 
operation, in our view. Despite ongoing volatility in the global macro 
environment, we believe that the sustained demand for commercial drug 
manufacturing is likely to continue, supporting the growth of leading CDMO 
players like WuXi AppTec.  
 Expanding global capacity to support long-term growth. As of end-1H25, 
WuXi AppTec’s backlog impressively grew by 37.2% YoY, with backlog of 
TIDES increasing even more strongly at 48.8% YoY. The mgmt. reiterated 
their plan to increase the Company’s peptide capacity to over 100k liters by 
the end of 2025 to support the demand from both existing commercial 
projects and growing pipelines. At the same time, capacity expansion efforts 
are underway at multiple sites, including Changzhou (China), Singapore, the 
US and Switzerland. WuXi AppTec has reaffirmed its capex target of RMB7–
8bn in 2025, and anticipated possible increases in capex in the coming years. 
 Recovery in early-stage R&D still takes time. While revenue from early-
stage R&D services showed sequential improvements in 1H25 over 2024, 
mgmt. viewed that a meaningful recovery in early-stage R&D demand will 
take time. Early-stage R&D services contribute ~30% of the Company’s total 
revenue. The global biotech financing usually serves as an early indicator of 
early-stage R&D demand. 
 Maintain BUY. We raise our DCF-based TP from RMB77.22 to RMB116.56 
(WACC: 9.42%, terminal growth: 2.00%; both unchanged), to factor in the 
upgraded guidance and the improved macro environment such as the US-
China tariff. We now expect revenue from continuing operations to grow by 
16.0%/ 15.9%/ 15.8% YoY and adjusted non-IFRS net profit to grow by 
16.2%/ 17.6%/ 16.4% YoY in 2025E/ 26E/ 27E, respectively.
