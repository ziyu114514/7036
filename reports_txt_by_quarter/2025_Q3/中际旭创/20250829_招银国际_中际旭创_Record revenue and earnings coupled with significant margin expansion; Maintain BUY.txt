Innolight (300308 CH) - Record 
revenue and earnings coupled 
with significant margin
Record revenue and earnings coupled with 
significant margin expansion; Maintain BUY  
 
Innolight delivered exceptionally strong 2Q25 results. Quarterly revenue 
was a record RMB8.1bn, up 36%/ 22% YoY/QoQ, driven by robust demand for 
high-end optical modules. Net profit surged to RMB2.4bn, up 79%/52% 
YoY/QoQ, beating BBG consensus by 28%. Both GPM and NPM hit record 
highs at 41.5%/29.7%, outperforming consensus by 5.7ppt/7.2ppt. Innolight 
announced its first interim dividend of RMB0.4 per share, boosting shareholder 
returns. Maintain BUY and raise TP to RMB415, based on 30x rollover 2026E 
P/E (previously 27x 2025E P/E), as we revise up earnings forecasts to reflect 
our positive outlook on the company, indicating sustained momentum in AI-
driven demand and mgmt.’s superior execution. 
 Sequential revenue improvement driven by optical transceivers’ sales 
increase (up 40%/98% YoY/QoQ). Mgmt. highlighted strong shipments of 
800G products, with 1.6T commencing ramp-up in 2Q and shipment to 
accelerate through 2H25. Notably, the company’s silicon photonics (SiPh) 
based 1.6T solutions are gaining traction with leading cloud customers. 
 AI capex cycle to support sustained growth. Overseas revenue (86% of 
1H25 sales) remained the primary growth driver. Per Bloomberg consensus, 
combined capex from key hyperscalers (Amazon/Google/Meta/Microsoft) is 
projected to grow 53%/17% YoY to US$329/350bn in 2025/26E, revised up 
by 5.7%/5.6% vs. consensus in May 2025. We raise our 2025/26E revenue 
forecasts by 5%/5%, respectively, factoring in stronger-than-expected AI 
infrastructure investments. We project 2025E revenue to increase 60%/32% 
YoY. 
 Significant margin expansion due to robust 800G/1.6T shipments and 
SiPh adoption. In 1H, optical transceivers’ GPM rose 6.1ppt YoY to 40.0%, 
while NPM increased by 5.8ppt YoY to 29.7%. The record margins were 
driven by 1) a higher sales contribution of 800G/1.6T products, 2) increasing 
adoption of higher-margin SiPh solutions, and 3) efficient supply-chain 
management (raw material inventory rose 17% QoQ in 2Q). 1.6T products, 
predominantly shipped in SiPh form, yield a better margin than earlier 
generations. We lift 2025/26E GPM projections to 43.0%/42.7% from 
39%/38%, anticipating further margin expansion as 1.6T shipments scale 
up and SiPh solutions increase. Mass production of 1.6T products in 2H 
should support sequential margin improvements. 
 Maintain BUY, with TP adjusted to RMB415, based on 30x rollover 2026E 
P/E, equivalent to 1-SD above 5-year historical avg, justified by Innolight’s 
leadership in a fast-growing AI optical market. Our NP forecasts for 
2025/26E are revised up by 28%/30%, on higher revenue and GPM 
assumptions.
