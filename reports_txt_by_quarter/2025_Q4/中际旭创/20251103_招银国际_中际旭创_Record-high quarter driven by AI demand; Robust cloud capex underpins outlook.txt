Innolight (300308 CH) 
Innolight (300308 CH) - Record-
high quarter driven by AI 
demand; Robust cloud capex
Record-high quarter driven by AI demand; 
Robust cloud capex underpins outlook  
 
Innolight delivered yet another record-breaking quarter, with revenue rising 
+57%/+26% YoY/QoQ to RMB10.2bn. Gross margin expanded sharply by 
+9.2/+1.3ppt YoY/QoQ to 42.8%, driven by strong leverage from 800G 
transceiver shipments and broader uptake of SiPh-based solutions. Net profit 
surged +125% YoY/+30% QoQ to RMB3.1bn, also a record high, with net 
margin reaching 30.7% (vs. 29.7% in 2Q25 and 21.4% in 3Q24). Reiterate 
BUY, with TP raised to RMB591.  
 Strong 800G shipments and rising SiPh adoption underpin record-
high GPM. GPM expansion was mainly driven by a richer product mix, led 
by sustained 800G volume growth and the ramp of 1.6T transceivers. The 
broader adoption of SiPh across both 800G and 1.6T product lines further 
lifted margins, given its inherently more favorable cost structure. Continued 
yield improvement and higher production efficiency also contributed to 
margin gains. Mgmt. expects 800G momentum to remain solid, while 1.6T 
SiPh transceivers are set to enter mass production in early-2026. 
 Raw material tightness manageable given market leadership. 
Mgmt. acknowledged ongoing tightness in key upstream optical 
components such as EML and CWL since 2024, but noted the company’s 
leading position in the global optical transceiver market enables it to secure 
sufficient material supply for production needs. The company has 
proactively locked in long-term capacity with major suppliers to mitigate 
potential disruptions. Mgmt. expects the current supply constraints to 
gradually ease by 1H26 as upstream manufacturers expand production 
capacity. 
 Hyperscalers’ expanding AI infrastructure capex reinforces near- to 
medium-term growth for the company. Major overseas hyperscalers 
continue to scale investment in AI infrastructure, providing a strong demand 
tailwind for Innolight. Google recently guided CY25E capex of US$91–93bn 
(vs. US$85bn previously), while Meta raised its CY25E target to US$70-
72bn. Microsoft also reiterated that capex will continue to grow despite 
earlier expectations of moderation. This sustained hyperscaler spending 
momentum will further support the company’s sales in the coming quarters. 
 Reiterate BUY, with TP raised to RMB591, based on 28x 2026E P/E, 1SD 
above 5-year historical avg. P/E, justified by Innolight’s leadership in AI 
optical transceivers market during this strong investment cycle. Our NP 
forecast for 2026E is revised up by 52%, reflecting higher revenue 
expectations due to increasing capex. Key risks include lower-than-
expected AI capex, geopolitical/tariff uncertainties, supply chain disruptions 
and intensified competition, etc.
