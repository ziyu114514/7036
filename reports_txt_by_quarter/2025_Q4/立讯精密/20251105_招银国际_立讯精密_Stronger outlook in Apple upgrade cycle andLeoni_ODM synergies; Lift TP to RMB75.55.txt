Luxshare (002475 CH) 
Luxshare (002475 CH) - 
Stronger outlook in Apple 
upgrade cycle and Leoni/ODM
Stronger outlook in Apple upgrade cycle and 
Leoni/ODM synergies; Lift TP to RMB75.55 
 
We raise TP to RMB75.55 (25% upside) to reflect our more positive view on 
iPhone 17/ foldable cycle, stronger synergy from Leoni/ODM integration, and AI 
server component pipeline (connectivity/thermal/power). We raise FY25-27E 
EPS by 0-19% to reflect FY25 guidance, enhanced synergy and better margin. 
We expect Luxshare to deliver 27% earnings CAGR over 2025-27E, driven by 
9%/54%/47% FY25-27E revenue CAGR from consumer electronics/automotive/ 
communication segments. Trading at 25x/20x FY25/26E P/E after recent 
pullback, valuation is attractive in our view. Upcoming catalysts include iPhone 
17 shipment, auto client wins, and AI server component ramp-up. 
 Beneficiary of Apple multi-product upgrade cycle. With a full coverage 
of Apple’s products (iPhone/Watch/AirPods/Mac/VisionPro), we believe 
Luxshare is well-positioned to benefit from strong execution and market 
share gains from Apple’s new product cycle in iPhone 17/foldable/20th 
anniversary edition and smart home/AI glasses during 2026-27E 
 Synergies from consolidation of Leoni and Wingtech's ODM. Mgmt. 
highlighted that the integration process has exceeded expectations: 1) 
original targets for Leoni (e.g. NP breakeven in 2025, GPM to reach corp. 
avg.) will be achieved at least one year earlier, and 2) vertical integration 
with Wingtech ODM will enhance competitiveness and boost exposure to 
non-Apple biz, particularly in PC segment targeting doubled sales over next 
three years. 
 Strong AI server product pipeline. We believe Luxshare is making 
progress with design wins and share gains with core AI server products 
(high-speed connectivity/power/thermal). In particular, mgmt. remains 
confident that CPC will become mainstream connectivity solution in near 
term, and AC/DC products have achieved breakthrough with core 
customers. 
 Upbeat FY25E guidance on iPhone 17 and better GPM. Luxshare guided 
FY25E NP growth of 24-29% YoY, mainly driven by new iPhone models and 
better profitability from Leoni and Wingtech assets. 3Q25 GPM at 12.8% 
(+1.1ppt YoY/0.8ppt QoQ) was a positive surprise, thanks to higher-margin 
auto/communications segments and strong execution of new acquisitions. 
 Multiple growth engines to drive re-rating; Raise TP to RMB75.55 We 
believe revenue mix shift to higher-growth, high-margin AI/auto segments 
along with stronger Apple upgrade cycle will boost re-rating. We raise our 
TP to RMB75.55, based on 10-year hist. avg. 25x FY26E P/E (vs prior 21x) 
for Apple cycle strength and strong execution of Leoni/ODM integrations.

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY with new TP of RMB 75.55 (25% upside) 
We derive our new 12M TP of RMB 75.55 based on higher 25x FY26E P/E (vs prior 21x 
FY26E P/E), in-line with the past 10-yr hist. fwd. P/E. We believe this is justified as Luxshare 
continues to deliver strong earnings growth, market share gains and product expansion to 
capture datacentre, Apple and NEV opportunities in the next 3-5 years.   
Upcoming catalysts include iPhone 17 shipment, auto client wins, and AI server component 
ramp-up.
