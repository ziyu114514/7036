United Imaging (688271 CH) - 
Strong recovery in Q3 
Strong recovery in Q3   
 
United Imaging (UIH) reported strong 9M25 results, with revenue of RMB8.9bn 
(+27% YoY), reaching 69% of our prior full-year estimate and exceeding the 
historical average of ~65%. The sharp 75% YoY revenue growth in 3Q25 was 
driven by a significant recovery in domestic equipment procurement, sustained 
overseas growth momentum, and a low base in 3Q24. Domestic demand 
remained solid, with the value of medical imaging tenders up by 55% YoY in 3Q25, 
according to Joinchain. Overseas growth was supported by strong order intake 
and improved order-to-revenue conversion. Therefore, we raise our 2025E 
revenue forecast to RMB13.3bn, implying 28.8% YoY growth. 
 Robust performance of high-end portfolios. UIH’s domestic revenue grew 
24% YoY to RMB6.9bn in 9M25, driven by procurement recovery and market 
share gain of over 4ppts. High-end products remained a key growth driver. 1) 
MR revenue grew 40% YoY, with notable share gains in 5T (+ ~52ppts) and 
3T (+over 4ppts). 2) CT revenue increased 8% YoY with high-end CT up ~30% 
YoY. We expect photon-counting CT uCT Ultima and uCT Siriux to further 
strengthen UIH’s position in the high-end CT market. 3) MI revenue rose 22% 
YoY with PET/CT maintaining its decade-long leading position in China. uMI 
Panorama has contributed ~40% of MI revenue. 4) XR and RT both delivered 
double-digit growth with continued share gains. The increasing revenue 
contribution from mid- to high-end products is expected to offset margin 
pressures from lower-end portfolios. Moreover, the upcoming launch of a 
comprehensive ultrasound portfolio in Nov 2025 should further support UIH’s 
“diagnosis-to-treatment” strategy and high-end imaging leadership, in our 
view.  
 Overseas business maintained strong momentum. Overseas revenue 
rose 42% to RMB2.0bn, representing 22.5% (+2.3ppts) of total revenue in 
9M25. Revenue in North America grew by over 50% YoY to ~RMB700mn in 
9M, with US service revenue up 80%+ YoY on the back of an expanding 
installed base. A diversified supply chain and proactive inventory management 
helped mitigate tariff pressure, while recurring service revenue may enhance 
long-term resilience. European revenue more than doubled YoY to over 
RMB400mn in 9M. Notably, uMI Panorama GS and uMI Panvivo have 
penetrated into the high-end market in Western Europe. Asia-Pacific and 
emerging markets also delivered double-digit growth. Management indicated 
robust overseas order intake. With stronger sales conversion from orders, we 
expect overseas growth to remain solid in 4Q25E. 
 Maintain BUY. Considering the rapid domestic recovery in 2025E and strong 
overseas growth momentum, we raise our forecasts of 2025–2027E revenue 
CAGR from 22.6% to 24.1%. Based on a 9-year DCF model (WACC: 8.1%, 
terminal growth: 4.0%), we raise our target price to RMB162.29.
