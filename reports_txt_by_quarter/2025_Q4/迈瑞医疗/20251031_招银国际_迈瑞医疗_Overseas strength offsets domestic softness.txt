Mindray (300760 CH) - 
Overseas strength offsets 
domestic softness
Overseas strength offsets domestic softness  
 
Mindray reported 9M25 revenue of RMB25.8bn, down by 12.4% YoY. Revenue 
in 3Q25 reached RMB9.1bn, up by 1.5% YoY, indicating a turnaround driven by 
accelerating overseas growth and mild domestic recovery. Overseas revenue 
rose 12% YoY to RMB4.6bn in 3Q, with revenue from Europe up by 29%. 
Domestic revenue fell by 7% YoY in 3Q, while the decline narrowed notably 
compared to 1H25. We anticipate a further acceleration in growth in 4Q25, 
supported by the ongoing recovery in domestic equipment procurement, solid 
overseas momentum, and a favorable base effect.  
 IVD: solid overseas growth; accelerated TLA installation. In 3Q25, IVD 
segment reported revenue of RMB3.6bn, down by 3% YoY, with overseas 
IVD revenue achieving double-digit growth. TLA (Total Laboratory 
Automation) installations continued to accelerate. In 9M25, 180 units of the 
MT8000 TLA were installed in China, and full-year domestic deployments 
are expected to exceed 200 units, per company guidance. Overseas 
MT8000 sales surpassed 20 units, which has met the full-year target. We 
expect TLA systems to enhance Mindray’s penetration into leading domestic 
hospitals and medium-to-high throughput labs overseas, supporting long-
term IVD growth. 
 MIS: continued high-end upgrade. MIS segment reported revenue of 
RMB1.7bn in 3Q25, roughly flat YoY. Overseas MIS grew at a high single-
digit rate, while sales of ultra-high-end products doubled in 9M25. We see 
significant potential for market share gains in high-end and ultra-high-end 
ultrasound, both domestically and internationally, driven by the rising 
adoption of Resona A20/ Nuewa A20 and upcoming launches in the 
premium portfolio. 
 Profitability under headwinds. Mindray’s attributable net margin declined 
to 29.3% in 9M25, down 7ppts YoY, mainly due to domestic pricing pressure 
from volume-based procurement (VBP) and intensified competition. 
Increased investment in overseas expansion also led to an increase in 
selling expenses. Going forward, we expect greater in-house reagent raw 
material production, a higher mix of high-end products, and growing 
overseas contribution to partly offset domestic margin pressure and support 
sound long-term profitability. 
 Maintain BUY. Given continued demand and pricing pressure in the IVD 
segment, we revise down our 2025E-27E forecasts and lower our target 
price to RMB249.21 based on a 9-year DCF model (WACC: 9.1%, terminal 
growth: 3.0%).
