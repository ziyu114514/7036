On October 20, a major coal mine accident took place at Shandong Longyun Coal
mine (not a Yanzhou asset), due to a rock burst (a spontaneous, violent fracture of
rock that can occur in deep mines). As a result, an emergency notice by the
Shandong Coal mine safety supervision department was issued, imposing a special
safety inspection on 41 coal mines located in Shandong, which are subject to similar
risk of a potential rock burst. The inspections will last one week, during which time
production at the target coal mine will be suspended, according to comments from
both the China Coal Association and Yanzhou Coal. Speciﬁcally, three of Yanzhou’s
coal mines located in the Shandong region were included on the inspection list,
which we estimate represent total annual capacity of 15.6mnt, or 44% of Yanzhou
Shandong operations, and 17% of the company’s total operations. Assuming one
week of production suspension, the disruption would lead to a 0.3mnt output cut, or
0.32% of Yanzhou’s full-year 2018E output, and 0.3% of the earnings impact on
2018E in our estimates. 
At the industry level, a one-week disruption at the 41 coal mines subject to
inspection could lead to a 3mnt cut to output (based on estimates from the China
Coal Association), or 0.08% of China’s coal output, thus, the impact to the market
would also be limited, in our view.
The three Yanzhou coal mines affected are: (1) Dongtan Mine (东滩) – 7.5mnt annual
capacity, thermal coal. (2) Jining No.2 Mine (济宁二号) – 4.2mnt annual capacity of
thermal coal. (3) Zhaolou (赵楼) with 3.9mnt capacity of semi-coking coal. We
estimate the three coal mines account for 15.8% of total gross proﬁt, based on their
speciﬁc type of coal product, and average HQ production cost. We estimate a
one-week suspension would lead to a 0.3mnt impact on output, or a 1.9% impact on
their contribution to total proﬁt – leading to a 0.3% impact on total proﬁt, all else
equal.
We  maintain our BUY rating on both Yanzhou Coal Mining H/A shares. Our 12-month
target price for Yanzhou-H remains at HK12.0 and for Yanzhou-A remains Rmb14.6,
and our TP methodology is unchanged, based on historical P/B vs. ROE correlation –
or 2019E P/B of 0.82X/1.19X at an ROE of 15.1%.

Goldman Sachs does and seeks to do business with companies covered in its research reports. As a result,
investors should be aware that the ﬁrm may have a conﬂict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this
report. Investors should consider this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision. For Reg AC
certiﬁcation and other important disclosures, see the Disclosure Appendix, or go to
www.gs.com/research/hedge.html. Analysts employed by non-US afﬁliates are not registered/qualiﬁed as research
analysts with FINRA in the U.S. 
Key risks include: 1) Coal prices in both the domestic China and international seaborne
markets, which are affected by both the supply-demand balance in the Chinese and
international markets; demand for coal is mostly driven by the power, steel and building
materials sectors; transportation capacity for coal, including both rail and ports, is also a
key factor affecting coal prices; 2) the Chinese government’s export policy on coal,
including export VAT rebate changes, export tax changes, and import tariff; and 3)
additional unexpected cost imposed on coal producers by the government, especially
relating to environmental concerns and resources.

Disclosure Appendix
Reg AC
We, Trina Chen and Yijian Zhang, hereby certify that all of the views expressed in this report accurately reﬂect our personal views about the subject
company or companies and its or their securities. We also certify that no part of our compensation was, is or will be, directly or indirectly, related to the
speciﬁc recommendations or views expressed in this report.
Unless otherwise stated, the individuals listed on the cover page of this report are analysts in Goldman Sachs’ Global Investment Research division.
GS Factor Proﬁle
The Goldman Sachs Factor Proﬁle provides investment context for a stock by comparing key attributes to the market (i.e. our coverage universe) and its
sector peers. The four key attributes depicted are: Growth, Financial Returns, Multiple (e.g. valuation) and Integrated (a composite of Growth, Financial
Returns and Multiple). Growth, Financial Returns and Multiple are calculated by using normalized ranks for speciﬁc metrics for each stock. The
normalized ranks for the metrics are then averaged and converted into percentiles for the relevant attribute. The precise calculation of each metric may
vary depending on the ﬁscal year, industry and region, but the standard approach is as follows:
Growth is based on a stock’s forward-looking sales growth, EBITDA growth and EPS growth (for ﬁnancial stocks, only EPS and sales growth), with a
higher percentile indicating a higher growth company. Financial Returns is based on a stock’s forward-looking ROE, ROCE and CROCI (for ﬁnancial
stocks, only ROE), with a higher percentile indicating a company with higher ﬁnancial returns. Multiple is based on a stock’s forward-looking P/E, P/B,
price/dividend (P/D), EV/EBITDA, EV/FCF and EV/Debt Adjusted Cash Flow (DACF) (for ﬁnancial stocks, only P/E, P/B and P/D), with a higher percentile
indicating a stock trading at a higher multiple. The Integrated percentile is calculated as the average of the Growth percentile, Financial Returns
percentile and (100% - Multiple percentile).
Financial Returns and Multiple use the Goldman Sachs analyst forecasts at the ﬁscal year-end at least three quarters in the future. Growth uses inputs
for the ﬁscal year at least seven quarters in the future compared with the year at least three quarters in the future (on a per-share basis for all metrics).
For a more detailed description of how we calculate the GS Factor Proﬁle, please contact your GS representative. 
M&A Rank
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary
across sectors and regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign a M&A rank as a means of scoring
companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2
representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard
departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not
factor into our price target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
Quantum
Quantum is Goldman Sachs’ proprietary database providing access to detailed ﬁnancial statement histories, forecasts and ratios. It can be used for
in-depth analysis of a single company, or to make comparisons between companies in different sectors and markets. 
GS SUSTAIN
GS SUSTAIN is a global investment strategy focused on the generation of long-term alpha through identifying high quality industry leaders. The GS
SUSTAIN 50 list includes leaders we believe to be well positioned to deliver long-term outperformance through superior returns on capital, sustainable
competitive advantage and effective management of ESG risks vs. global industry peers. Candidates are selected largely on a combination of
quantiﬁable analysis of these three aspects of corporate performance.

Ratings, coverage groups and views and related deﬁnitions
Buy (B), Neutral (N), Sell (S) -Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or
Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage. Any stock not assigned as a Buy or a Sell on an
Investment List with an active rating (i.e., a  stock that is not Rating Suspended, Not Rated, Coverage Suspended or Not Covered), is deemed Neutral.
Each regional Investment Review Committee manages various regional Investment Lists to a global guideline of 25%-35% of stocks as Buy and
10%-15% of stocks as Sell; however, the distribution of Buys and Sells in any particular analyst’s coverage group may vary as determined by the
regional Investment Review Committee. Additionally, each Investment Review Committee manages Regional Conviction lists, which represent
investment recommendations focused on the size of the total return potential and/or the likelihood of the realization of the return across their
respective areas of coverage.  The addition or removal of stocks from such Conviction lists do not represent a change in the analysts’ investment rating
for such stocks.   
Total return potential represents the upside or downside differential between the current share price and the price target, including all paid or
anticipated dividends, expected during the time horizon associated with the price target. Price targets are required for all covered stocks. The total
return potential, price target and associated time horizon are stated in each report adding or reiterating an Investment List membership. 
Coverage groups and views: A list of all stocks in each coverage group is available by primary analyst, stock and coverage group at
http://www.gs.com/research/hedge.html. The analyst assigns one of the following coverage views which represents the analyst’s investment outlook
on the coverage group relative to the group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  Attractive (A). The investment outlook over the following 12
months is favorable relative to the coverage group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  Neutral (N). The investment outlook over the following
12 months is neutral relative to the coverage group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  Cautious (C). The investment outlook over the following
12 months is unfavorable relative to the coverage group’s historical fundamentals and/or valuation.  
Not Rated (NR). The investment rating and target price have been removed pursuant to Goldman Sachs policy when Goldman Sachs is acting in an
advisory capacity in a merger or strategic transaction involving this company and in certain other circumstances.  Rating Suspended (RS). Goldman
Sachs Research has suspended the investment rating and price target for this stock, because there is not a sufﬁcient fundamental basis for
determining, or there are legal, regulatory or policy constraints around publishing, an investment rating or target. The previous investment rating and
price target, if any, are no longer in effect for this stock and should not be relied upon.  Coverage Suspended (CS). Goldman Sachs has suspended
coverage of this company.  Not Covered (NC). Goldman Sachs does not cover this company.  Not Available or Not Applicable (NA). The information
is not available for display or is not applicable.  Not Meaningful (NM). The information is not meaningful and is therefore excluded.
