Following the recent company announcement regarding an IPO in the German 
market, we have prepared this report to help investors better understand the 
company and the industry. In this report we analyse Qingdao Haier’s 
competitive positioning, with a focus on (1) peer comparison; (2) kitchen and 
EU growth opportunities; and (3) Haier’s strategies to grow Smart Home 
solutions while improving execution. Please note we are restricted on the 
stock. 
Balanced product portfolio and strong brand presence globally 
 
Compared with its major Chinese competitors in the white goods segment, 
Midea and Gree, Qingdao Haier commands a more balanced revenue mix 
between washing machine, refrigerator and air conditioner (Figure 2). 
Haier also focuses on branded revenue (minimal contract manufacturing; 
Figure 3) and has one of the strongest track records in acquiring and 
building brands (Figure 4). 
 
Haier’s business focus has secured a leading market presence globally 
(Figs. 7-9 China, Figs. 22-39 global), with expanding market share. We 
note that Haier is the only white goods company to command top-five 
market share positions in China, the US, SEA and North Asia.  
 
Financially, Qingdao Haier’s revenue growth profile has been more stable 
than those of Midea and Gree (Figure 13), with a strong gross margin. Yet, 
Qingdao Haier’s opex-to-sales ratio is materially higher than peers’ due to 
its different business structure (discussed below).  
Growth opportunities: kitchen and Europe market share expansion 
 
Qingdao Haier plans to expand its share in global kitchen appliances 
markets, leveraging its premium brands (Casarte and Fisher & Paykel). 
Kitchen appliances are already a significant market when compared to 
traditional white goods. Euromonitor estimates China’s kitchen appliances 
market is even bigger than washing machine (Figure 41). 
 
Qingdao Haier has announced a target of attaining a top-five market share 
in Europe by 2022 (vs. currently ninth place with a 2.3% share, Figure 42). 
In our view, the EU is a more scattered market than China or the US, while 
Qingdao Haier’s multi-brand strategy will help its expansion.  
Smart Home strategy and improving execution 
 
By selling a solution in a bundle to consumers (vs. previously selling single 
items), Qingdao Haier aims to achieve market share gains and improved 
consumer loyalty. It is crucial to drive consumers’ return purchases as 
replacement demand continues to rise against slowing new home sales. 
 
Haier conducts its business through both Qingdao Haier and Haier 
Electronics, forming a different business structure (Figure 50). Haier has 
been aligning the two entities’ business goals to enhance execution.

Peer comparison and 
market presence 
Qingdao Haier vs. local champions 
Qingdao Haier’s differentiation: (1) balanced revenue mix; (2) focus on own-
brand revenue; and (3) leading multi-brand portfolio 
 
Balanced product portfolio, including washing machines, refrigerators, air 
conditioners, kitchen appliances, etc. (although significantly smaller 
revenues than Midea, which has a much larger air conditioner business 
than Qingdao Haier).

Qingdao Haier’s financial performance: (1) more stable revenue growth profile; 
(2) comparable gross margin in key segments; (3) higher opex-to-sales ratio 
 
More stable revenue growth compared to peers: this essentially reflects 
Qingdao Haier’s greater revenue exposure to washing machine and 
refrigerator (segments that are less sensitive to the property cycle; Figure 
15 and Figure 16).

Higher opex-to-revenue ratio: we attribute Qingdao Haier’s higher opex-to-

works with Haier Electronics to produce and distribute its products, which 
is discussed in more detail in page 16 this report.

Increasing selling expenses-to-revenue: likely due to increased investments 
in the distribution channel to help improve distributors’ efficiency.

Haier vs. international players 
Haier: a true global brand 
We summarize below the global top players and their market share, as 
estimated by Euromonitor. The most important takeaway is that Haier 
(including GEA and Fisher & Paykel brands) is the only company that 
commands significant market share in washing machine, refrigerator and air 
conditioner in almost all major markets. Note that Midea and Gree do not 
command significant market share in overseas markets. We believe this stems 
from the duo’s heavier focus on contract manufacturing, vs. Qingdao Haier’s 
branded strategy.

Qingdao Haier stacked up well in terms of operating margin vs. global peers in 
2017 although we note that this was not the case in 2016. Margins across the 
peer group generally fell in 2017 YoY, likely due to rising raw material costs 
while margins for Qingdao Haier improved slightly due to better control of raw 
material costs and increased wholesale prices to pass on the additional costs.

Growth opportunities 
Identifying Haier’s global growth opportunities 
Top growth markets: (1) SEA; and (2) China kitchen appliances 
Based on Euromonitor’s forecasts (Figure 41), we have identified the South 
East Asia and China kitchen appliances markets as being the most lucrative 
opportunities (decent market scale with strong growth outlook). We also note 
that China's kitchen appliances market is a very scattered market. This could 
provide an opportunity for more resourceful new entrants (like Qingdao Haier) 
to consolidate the market and take market share. Although China’s air 
conditioner market is seen by Euromonitor as a key growth opportunity in the 
global white goods industry, we do not expect Qingdao Haier to increase its 
investment significantly in this market due to the heavy competition and 
Haier’s lack of scale. We expect Qingdao Haier to stay as a niche player 
targeting the premium split-type air conditioner markets in China.

Haier’s ambitions for Europe 
EU: a more scattered market requiring multi-brand strategy 
We attribute Haier’s lower market share in Western Europe (Figure 42) to the 
market nature – a more scattered market. Haier plans to leverage its multi-
brand portfolio to capture opportunities in the scattered market. 
Goals and strategies 
 
Goal: 2022 market share: Qingdao Haier announced a target to garner 
top-five market share in Europe by 2022 (vs. ninth place currently with 
2.3% share, Figure 42), according to its analyst meeting on 31 May 
2018. 
 
Strategies: three key markets 
(1) Western Europe: Haier plans to upgrade its products, especially 
refrigerator and washing machine. Management believes its new 
premium brands (GEA and Fisher & Paykel) alongside improving 
the Haier brand image will fulfil these goals.  
(2) Russia: Haier aims to expand domestic production to drive key 
segments, including high-end refrigerator.  
(3) Eastern Europe: Haier plans to follow the Russia model to boost 
domestic production.

China’s cyclical downtrend will eventually ease, while US 
economy remains robust 
China air conditioner cyclical downtrend is our main concern, but Qingdao 
Haier’s exposure is less significant 
We expect China’s air conditioner over-inventory issue to push the industry 
into a destocking mode. If we use the 2015 downcycle as an example, it could 
take 12-24 months to clear the excessive channel inventory. Having said that, 
Qingdao Haier’s exposure to air conditioner is less significant vs. Midea and 
Gree (see “Key Risk” section for discussions on China air conditioner market). 
China washing machine and refrigerator growth still driven by ASP 
Management indicated sustainable washing machine and refrigerator revenue 
growth during the 1H18 earnings call. This is driven by ASP upgrades and 
better functionality (penetration of washer-drier). Latest revenue growth in 
1H18 as well as China Market Monitor data also suggest that Qingdao Haier is 
taking washing machine market share in China from Midea & Little Swan using 
its Casarte brand.  
China kitchen appliances: the long-term story remains intact 
Key players (Robam and Fotile) saw the impact from property market 
slowdown. However, we think this headwind provides an important 
opportunity for more resourceful home appliances groups to enter the kitchen 
appliances market to take market share. In addition, based on previous 
property cycles, we expect the kitchen appliances headwind to ease along with 
recovering property transaction growth. 
US economic growth remains resilient 
Qingdao Haier, via GEA, has more than 20% revenue exposure to the US. DB 
economists forecast a resilient 2.9%/2.7% GDP growth in 2018/2019.

Trade war risks 
Industry impact: we worry more about price hikes and reduced demand 
 
Direct impact appears limited: The latest tariff list from the US 
(announced on September 17 2018) included most of China’s white 
goods, except for washing machines (Figure 43). China’s home 
appliances exports to the US are less significant, especially air 
conditioners (both split type and central type) and washing machines 
(Figure 44). We are also less concerned about other countries taking 
significant share from China’s appliances manufacturers, due to 
China’s leading scale and market share (Figure 45).

 
But, we worry about increased costs hurting demand: China is the 
biggest supplier of compressors globally (for both air conditioners and 
refrigerators, Figure 45) and one of the top motor makers. As a result, 
the tariff could increase global home appliances costs. Whirlpool 
indicated that the tariff could increase the costs of its dishwashers, 
which are made in Ohio, US (Nikkei News, dated 18 September 2018). 
If home appliances brands increase prices to pass on the additional 
costs, this might reduce consumer demand.  
Qingdao Haier’s impact: current operations intact, but synergies hindered 
 
Current operation intact: Qingdao Haier’s global factories (especially 
those held by GEA) will help hedge it from the China-US trade 
disputes. We estimate Qingdao Haier’s exports from China to the US 
account for less than 5% of its revenue. 
 
Co-procurement and production synergy affected: however, the 
additional tariff could affect Qingdao Haier’s plan to shift GEA’s 
manufacturing and raw material procurement back to China. Our 
calculation suggests a 10% tariff (the proposed tariff by the US 
government, to-be increased to 25% starting 1 January 2019) could 
increase GEA’s costs by more than RMB2bn (if shifting production in 
China and export to the US), more than offsetting the guided cost 
saving (by management) of RMB1bn. 
 
Suspending plans to introduce GEA in China: Qingdao Haier has 
reportedly announced that it will no longer sell made-in-US GEA 
products in China (Financial Times, dated 20 September 2018). We 
note that the original plan was to introduce GEA’s premium collection 
(especially kitchen appliances) in China. As a result, we now expect

Smart Home strategy and 
execution turnaround  
Smart Home = selling bundled solutions 
Benefits of selling a solution: (1) market share gain; and (2) consumer 
stickiness  
 
As replacement demand continues to outpace new purchases (in 
China), home appliances players shift their focus from selling 
appliances to selling bundled solutions. For example, this could 
include water heater & purifier and/or air conditioners with sensors to 
detect movements.  
 
Such bundle sales benefits brands’ market share and, more 
importantly, enables more return purchases by consumers.  
Figure 46: Haier’s Smart Home solution 
Source: Deutsche Bank, company data 
Haier’s advantage to drive Smart Home: product and brand portfolio 
Haier’s leadership in refrigerator and washing machine, on top of innovative 
product offerings in air conditioner (self-cleaning) and kitchen appliances 
(embedded products) allow it to provide a more comprehensive solution 
(please refer to Figure 22 to Figure 39, in which we highlight Qingdao Haier’s 
balanced leading market share in major markets). This is a major advantage 
when compared to other home appliances players (Samsung SmartThings, LG 
SmartThinQ, Midea M-Smart), in our view. 
Haier’s initiative to execute the Smart Home strategy: 
 
A software platform to accommodate all the connected appliances: 
Haier U+ (operating system: UHomeOS) 
 
A manufacturing system that caters to tailor-made demands:

Execution turnaround: aligning Qingdao Haier and Haier 
Electronics’ business goals 
Qingdao Haier and Haier Electronics: a different business structure 
 
Haier Electronics (56%-owned by Qingdao Haier) is closely embedded 
into Qingdao Haier’s business to operate manufacturing, logistics and 
distribution. 
 
Haier’s business structure is very different from those of Midea and 
Gree (Figure 50 & Figure 51). 
 
Currently, Haier Electronics’ main responsibilities are related to 
distribution and logistics (on top of washing machine and water heater 
manufacturing). 
 
As a result, we witnessed frequent related party transactions between 
Qingdao Haier, Haier Electronics and the private parent company: 
(Figure 49) 
(1) On the procurement side: Qingdao Haier’s financial report records 
significant related party procurement from the private parent 
company.  
(2) On the sales side, the recorded related party transactions are limited. 
We believe some of Qingdao Haier’s related sales with Haier 
Electronics are not recorded in the financial statement: as Qingdao 
Haier consolidates Haier Electronics, so the transactions between the 
two entities will be eliminated.

Some misalignments in the past… 
 
In the past, Qingdao Haier management operated more on KPIs 
related 
to 
branding 
and 
manufacturing. 
Haier 
Electronics’ 
performance, on the other hand, is measured more by logistics and 
channel management.  
 
Such “misalignments” partly explained Qingdao Haier’s higher opex-
to-revenue ratio vs. peers (Figure 20, Figure 21 and Figure 40). 
…addressed by RenDanHeYi (revamp KPIs to focus on consumer satisfaction) 
 
Qingdao Haier and Haier Electronics’ business goals started to 
integrate under the RenDanHeYi (人單合一) guideline since 2015-2016. 
 
RenDanHeYi has significantly adjusted both Qingdao Haier and Haier 
Electronics’ business goals to focus on consumer satisfaction. In our 
view, this strengthens the cooperation between the two companies 
and will drive better execution.

Earnings drivers 
Income statement 
We project 10% revenue CAGR in 2018 and 2019E, driven by: 
(1) A high-single-digit ASP increase for key segments including refrigerator, 
washing machine and air conditioners. Note: most of the ASP increases 
stem from mix upgrades (washing machine: rising drum-type and washer-
drier 
penetration, 
refrigerator: 
rising 
large 
capacity 
French-door 
refrigerators, air conditioner: increased presence of Haier’s proprietary 
self-cleaning technology). 
(2) High-single-digit volume growth for washing machine and refrigerator, 
reflecting the increased market share from Casarte. 
(3)  Note that we are more conservative on kitchen appliances revenue 
growth in 2018; this is to reflect the drag from the slowdown in China’s 
property market (note we use DB China property team’s official forecasts, 
which estimate a 5% yoy decline in China’s new housing GFA in 2018). 
However, we expect kitchen appliances growth rates to recover in 2019E. 
(4) FX assumptions: the majority of Qingdao Haier’s revenue is from China (in 
RMB). For the company’s export business (excluding GEA), it is 
denominated in local currency. For GEA, the revenue comes mainly from 
the US and is denominated in USD. We use DB’s house view on FX rates 
in our model. As suggested by Figure 60, we expect recent RMB/USD 
moves to be positive for Qingdao Haier’s revenue.

We project 17% EBIT CAGR in 2018 and 2019E, driven by: 
(1) Improved gross margin by 1.3ppt and 0.1ppt yoy in 2018 and 2019. This is 
driven by better business mix, margin improvements at key business 
segments (due to product upgrades) and easing raw material cost 
pressure. 
(2) Cost analysis: we expect Qingdao Haier’s cost pressure to improve as the 
price of key raw materials stabilise (Figure 63 to Figure 66).

(3) We forecast EBIT margin to be driven by gross margin expansion. We 
expect Qingdao Haier to control its opex-to-revenue ratio due to better 
operating efficiency.  
We project 17% earnings CAGR in 2018 and 2019E, driven by EBIT growth 
We expect Qingdao Haier’s earnings growth to be similar vs. EBIT growth. 
While Midea and Gree have stronger earnings growth, we attribute part of 
their growth to the significant interest income from lending to their distributors 
(see reports on Midea [link] and Gree [link]). We note that the lending business 
could increase investors’ risk exposure to the air conditioners downcycle. 
Note that most of the minority interest is from Qingdao Haier’s un-owned 
stake in Haier Electronics (44% in Haier Electronics).

Trade war impact 
In our base case model, we assume RMB500m of synergy from GEA cost 
savings (producing GEA products in China) in 2019. As discussed in page 12, 
the modelled synergy could face downside risks. 
Balance sheet 
Healthy working capital conditions 
We expect Qingdao Haier to continue leveraging its strong bargaining power 
to drive accounts payable days. We forecast the bargaining power to be 
strengthened with Qingdao Haier’s improved scale, after it integrates the 
sourcing of GEA and Fisher & Paykel.  
Overseas debt and management’s efforts to refinance 
We believe that Qingdao Haier has incurred overseas debt during the 
acquisition of GEA (this is our estimate based on management’s public 
guidance on the transaction). During the acquisition, management indicated 
that 60% of the USD5.4bn consideration would be financed by bank loans. To 
refinance the borrowing, Qingdao Haier announced (on 7 November 2017) it 
would issue a HKD8bn convertible bond. We forecast Qingdao Haier to further 
improve its financial leverage. As of 1H18, Qingdao Haier disclosed over 
USD3bn of debt in USD, representing 60% of the USD5.4bn acquisition 
consideration, in our view. Such USD-denominated debt accounts for 66% of 
Qingdao Haier’s total debt, based on our calculation.

(1) Weaker market share expansion in EU: would hinder the company’s 
growth. 
(2) Trade war intensifying (see above section “Trade war risks”). 
(3) Less favourable USDCNY FX rate: we expect limited impact on gross 
margin (see below for calculation), but greater impact on non-operating

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank 
may 
act 
as 
principal 
for 
its 
own 
account 
or 
as 
agent 
for 
another 
person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, 
perspectives or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. 
Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , 
and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company’s page. A Catalyst Call represents a 
high-conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector 
over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may 
occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the 
frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company-specific economic prospects make it 
difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the 
Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is 
provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial 
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial 
instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of 
the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and 
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are 
subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in 
exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are 
current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and 
other 
vendors.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income 
instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX 
depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by 
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons 
indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency 
that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks

movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax 
position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take 
expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed 
exchange controls, which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.  
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://research.db.com/Research/ on each company’s research page. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this 
information before investing.

been made consistent with the categories used by Analysts globally; and the effective time period for CCs has been 
reduced from a maximum of 180 days to 90 days.
