Weak results and lack of growth
catalysts
Lack of exciting growth drivers in 4Q18 and 2019
Goertek released weak 3Q18 results and lukewarm 4Q18 guidance, due to VR
(Virtual Reality) headset weakness and rising competition in iPhone acoustics
(Luxshare gaining market share, in our view). In the results conference call, the
ﬁrm highlighted smart audio, wearable devices and MEMS components as key
2019 growth drivers (which we believe are too small to move the needle), while
not being able to fully address investors' concerns on iPhone acoustics and VR
headsets. We maintain our Hold rating.
Soft 3Q18 results – GPM surprises on the downside
Goertek reported 3Q18 EPS of CNY0.13 (-38% YoY: +58% QoQ) and operating
proﬁt of CNY637mn (-17% YoY; +96% QoQ) on sales of CNY7.0bn (-4% YoY; +61%
QoQ). Sales slightly missed our estimates by 4%, but operating proﬁt materially
fell short by 25%, with GPM falling 2ppt QoQ to 19% (the lowest level since IPO).
Goertek attributed the soft top-line and GPM performance to weak VR headset
demand, but we believe the low production yields in new projects (Airpod) and
intensiﬁed pricing pressure on iPhone acoustics (due to Luxshare's competition)
also contributed to the sharp GPM decline. Coupled with higher non-op loss
(largely due to asset write-oﬀ expenses), EPS missed our estimates by 45%.
4Q18 and 2019 outlook – intensifying competition ahead
Goertek expects 4Q18 EPS to fall in the range of CNY320mn (-58% YoY; -23%
QoQ) to CNY748mn (-1% YoY; +82% QoQ). The mid-point of the guidance
(CNY534mn) missed our estimates by 40%. The ﬁrm attributes the lukewarm
4Q18 outlook to continued VR weakness and competition in iPhone acoustics.
Goertek did not provide 2019 guidance, but it highlighted several growth drivers,
including: 1) organic growth in smart watches and smart speakers possibly
driving demand for miniature acoustic components; 2) market share gains in
current MEMS microphone projects (iPhone, in our view); 3) tapping into other
new MEMS products (such as MEMS barometers) and 4) MR (Mixed Reality)
and AR (Augmented Reality) headsets possibly gradually emerging to oﬀset soft
VR hardware demand. However, we believe that sales/proﬁt contributions from
these new projects/products will not be meaningful enough to rekindle Goertek's
growth momentum. We expect top-line weakness and ASP/GPM pressure to
persist into 2019, as its core businesses could remain in a downtrend. We believe
that Luxshare (Buy; CNY 17.19) could keep gaining share in iPhone acoustics, and

that VR headset demand is unlikely to see a meaningful rebound (due to lack of
killer applications and a well developed ecosystem) in coming years.
Valuation and risks
We signiﬁcantly lower our forecasts by 41-48% for 2018-20E EPS in order to
reﬂect intensiﬁed acoustic competition (losing market share to Luxshare), soft VR
headset demand and slow production yield ramp-up in Airpod. We reduce our
target price from RMB14 to RMB7.3, which is still based on 0.8x PEG, or 14x
2019E PER (vs. prior 18x PER). The 0.8x PEG is in line with regional peers. Upside/
downside risks include forex, market share gain/loss and ASP and global demand
increases/declines.

which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient

does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.

Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
