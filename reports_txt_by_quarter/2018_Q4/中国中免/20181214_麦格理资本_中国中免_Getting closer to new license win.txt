Getting closer to new license win 
Event 
 CITS announced (link) that one of its sub-subsidiaries is authorized to 
participate in the bidding for the right to use six pieces of land in Haikou, 
Hainan Province. We believe the land could be for the construction of the new 
Haikou downtown duty-free shop (DFS) and CITS is likely to win this license. 
Impact 
 CITS is likely to win the license for Haikou downtown DFS. According to 
the announcement, CITS will inject Rmb1.5bn into a wholly-owned subsidiary, 
CITS Investment Development Co., Ltd. (CITS Investment). Meanwhile, CITS 
Investment will inject Rmb1.4bn into its wholly-owned subsidiary CITS 
(Haikou) Investment Development Co., Ltd. (Haikou Investment). Haikou 
Investment will be the entity to bid for the land use rights. We believe CITS is 
likely to win this bid and become the operator for the new DFS. 
 Hainan duty-free quota raise is favourable for December sales recovery. 
With the offshore duty-free quota raised to Rmb 30,000 per person per year 
from Dec 1, 2018, Hainan’s duty-free shops, namely Haikou Meilan Airport 
DFS and CITS’ Sanya DFS, could expect sales recovery in December. The 
quota raise, along with the traditional peak tourist season in Hainan, could help 
boost duty-free sales. 
 Government crackdown on Daigou trades could benefit CITS. As CITS 
may gain the control over Haikou Meilan DFS from a previous equity exchange 
agreement (link), we see CITS continuing to shore up its leading position in 
Hainan duty-free market if it wins the new license. Meanwhile, the Chinese 
government’s crackdown on Daigou trades could help to drive consumption 
back and benefit duty-free players, including CITS. 
Action and recommendation 
 Reiterate Outperform.
