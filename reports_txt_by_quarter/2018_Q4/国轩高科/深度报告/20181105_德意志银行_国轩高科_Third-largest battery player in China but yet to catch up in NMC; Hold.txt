Third-largest battery player in China but
yet to catch up in NMC; Hold
New capacity on the way, but yet to see meaningful shipments of NMC battery;
Hold
Guoxuan High-Tech, the third-largest battery player in China, aims to double its
capacity by 2020, and even to triple it starting in 2021. The company started with
the LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery, and it is now trying to ramp up the NMC
(lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide) battery business. However, meaningful
progress is yet to be seen in the NMC battery, with Guoxuan having only 0.4%
NMC market share by 9M18. We set our target price at 15x 2019E P/E, in line with
the industry average. With 9% upside potential, we maintain our Hold view on
Guoxuan. This report marks the transfer of coverage from James Kan to Sharon
Ding.
Weak 3Q due to lower shipments; keep an eye on NMC battery
Guoxuan recorded RMB4.1bn revenue in 9M2018, achieving only 59% of our
estimate, as a result of weak shipments due to the subsidy cut in the middle
of this year. Gross margin in the ﬁrst nine months also missed our expectation
by 2ppt, a result of ASP pressure and lower volume. In terms of NMC battery,
management mentioned there is no technical or customer issue, but it is awaiting
massive commercial shipments. The company is yet to prove it can repeat its
success in LFP battery.
Cutting target price to RMB13.3 and maintaining Hold; risks
Despite the company's aggressive capacity expansion plan, we are yet to see
meaningful shipments in NMC battery. We lower our 2018 and 2019 earnings
estimates by 12% and 10%, respectively, to factor in its weaker-than-expected
shipments and ASP pressure. Our target price of RMB13.3 (down from RMB15.58)
is based on a target multiple of 15x 2019E P/E, in line with the battery industry
average; the lower TP reﬂects a shift from a 15.4x multiple and our lower
estimates. We maintain our Hold rating. Risks include faster or slower capacity
ramp-up and shipments.

Guoxuan High-Tech
Capacity overview - aggressive expansion on the way
According to management, Guoxuan currently has around 10Gwh eﬀective
capacity, of which 70-80% is LFP capacity. Total capacity, including that under
construction, is around 21Gwh and is expected to be ramped up in the next year
or two. The company envisions another 10G in the pipeline, eventually bringing
its capacity to 30Gwh by ~2021. Upcoming capacity will include both LFP and
NMC, with the detailed split dependent on market conditions.

Global EV capacity is expected to quadruple to about 500Gwh by 2020 compared
to the end of 2017 (see report from our Korea team here ). Guoxuan is among the
battery players that are building capacity to capture the secular growth, and has
demonstrated comparable margin to CATL, the No.1 player in China, thanks to
Guoxuan's self-supplied cathode materials.
However, as per the company's schedule, we expect to see Guoxuan's capacity
commencement mostly falling in the second half of each year, thus creating a
larger gap between its estimated sales versus year-end capacity, compared to a
smaller gap for CATL, as the latter's capacity commencement schedule is more
evenly distributed throughout the year.

Yet to see meaningful progress in NMC battery
According to Reali, Guoxuan's NMC installation market share reached only
c.0.4% in the ﬁrst nine months of this year. Meanwhile, management mentioned
that installation market share is only part of the story because some of the
company's sales volume is not included. It seems to us that Guoxuan is yet to
have meaningful presence in NMC battery space.
According to the company, there is no issue with NMC production or clients, but
it takes time to make commercial sales and it wants to ensure there are no safety
issues.

Our target price of RMB13.3 is based on target multiple at 15x 2019E P/E, which
is in line with the battery industry average. The company is currently trading at
16x/14x 2018/19 DBe EPS, and we believe the valuation is fair. We thus maintain
Hold.

Investment thesis
Outlook
Guoxuan is the third-largest EV lithium battery player in China, with c.5%
EV lithium battery market share in terms of installation by 3Q18. We believe
Guoxuan's aggressive capacity expansion and competitive advantages should
help it to grow market share and make it one of the beneﬁciaries of the Chinese
government's target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020. However,
battery unit pricing decline and EV subsidy policy change may put pressure on
its margin outlook. In addition, we are yet to see Guoxuan have meaningful entry
into the NMC market. Hold.
Valuation
As Guoxuan has listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO in 2015, we
believe its historical P/E band may not reﬂect its future outlook. We adopt a 2019E
P/E multiple of 15x for the company, which we believe has factored in its growth
trajectory and is in line with battery manufacturers' average.
Risks
Key industry up/downside risks: 1) signiﬁcant changes in the Chinese
government's EV subsidy policy; 2) weaker/stronger-than-expected volume
growth in the next three years; 3) quicker/slower-than-expected ASP drop or
quicker/slower-than-expected cost cuts.

believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.
??
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its
own account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes
on. Analysts are paid in part based on the proﬁtability of Deutsche Bank AG and its aﬃliates, which includes investment
banking, trading and principal trading revenues.
??
Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of
no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed
in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and investors must make their own informed investment decisions.
Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
??
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
