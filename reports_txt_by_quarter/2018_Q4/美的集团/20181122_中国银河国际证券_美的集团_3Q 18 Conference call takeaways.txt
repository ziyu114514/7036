MIDEA GROUP [000333.CH]: 3Q 18 Conference call takeaways 
Midea reported 3Q18 results, with top/bottom line growing 1%/18% respectively 
for the quarter, vs. 10%/19% for 9M18. With revenue growth facing macro 
headwinds and ASP growth (consumer upgrade) stalling in the AC segment, we 
think the stock is likely to remain under pressure. We have cut our 2018/2019 
EPS by 3%/17% respectively, and reduce our PT from RMB 53 to RMB 42. 
 Investment Highlights 
Profit boosted by finance income, operating profit disappoints: Total 
revenue rose 1% YoY, with net profit growing 18% YoY on account of gross 
margin expansion and reduced finance expense. Midea’s 3Q18 top line fell short 
of our expectation for mid-single digit revenue growth in second half. PBT growth 
of 24.5% for the quarter was supported by improvements in finance costs. 
Underlying operating profit grew only 9% (See Figure 1). 
Upgrade trend slowing in AC: Midea’s gross margins increased to 28.1%, up 
from 25.9% a year ago. Mgmt indicated AC growth of ~18% YoY in 9M18, 
suggesting negative growth for AC in 3Q18 based on 28% AC growth in 1H18. 
ASP increase was flat for 3Q18, vs. ~10% growth in 1H18. This remains a key 
concern, as consumer upgrade and margin expansion has been part of our 
Midea thesis. 
Low channel inventory: Midea’s AC inventory remains well controlled, with 1-2 
months of combined total factory and channel inventory, or approximately 5 
million units. In other appliance segments, Midea also reports that channel 
inventory is near historical lows. While we believe there is a high probability of 
revenue weakness into 4Q18, we don’t believe Midea’s AC industry channel 
inventory levels are reminiscent of 2015 levels, when destocking led to a 
sustained sales contraction. 
Inexpensive Valuation. With ~35% sales from international sources (ex KUKA) 
and lower ASPs relative to Gree and Qingdao Haier, Midea remains well 
situated to ride out a slowdown in China’s home appliance market. Currently 
trading at 11.1x 2019E PER, we expect Midea to post 21%/0% EPS growth in 
2018/2019, down from our former estimates of 21%/11% EPS growth. Our 
2018/2019 earnings have been reduced by 3.5%/17.2% respectively. Our new 
TP is based on a valuation of 13x 2019 EPS, down from our former 15x, which 
we believe is justifiable for a business with a diversified franchise, stable market 
share, and high single digit earnings growth.

Target Price Reduction 
We keep our prior margin assumptions, but reduce top line growth for 2018/2019. Under our new 
assumptions, revenue growth declines from 11%/6% in 2018/2019 to 9%/1%, respectively. Our 2018/2019 
revenue estimates are 3%/11% lower than consensus, while our 2018/2019 profit expectations are 2% 
higher/11% lower than consensus. 
We cut our price target from RMB 53 to RMB 42 on account of lower earnings growth, and assign a new 13x 
2019 PER multiple to the stock, vs. our 15x multiple used in our prior number. Using our previous 15x 2019 
PER valuation, our current target price would be RMB 48.

Takeaways from Midea’s Management Call 
 
Guidance: Midea continues to guide for high single digit top line and double digit profit growth into 2019. 
 
AC Growth: Negative 3Q18 growth, flat ASPs: Mgmt indicated AC growth of ~18% YoY in 9M18. 
Based on reported AC growth of 32% in 1H18, this suggests negative growth for AC in 3Q18. According 
to management, ASP increase was flat for 3Q18, vs. ~10% growth in 1H18. This remains a key concern, 
as consumer upgrade and margin expansion has been part of our Midea thesis. Midea indicated that 
installation growth was negative in October. 
 
AC Inventory Tight: AC Channel inventory remains tightly controlled, with 5Mn units, or roughly 2-2.5 
months of annual production on our estimates. This compares favourably to Gree, which reportedly holds 
~15Mn units in channel inventory, nearly 5 months of its annual production on our estimates. Midea 
emphasized it holds 100 warehouses in China, which ship AC units directly to retailers. Midea spends 
RMB 800m annually on this inventory and warehousing management system, which tracks inventory 
levels daily. 
 
Gree channel stuffing unlikely to impact Midea: Management assuaged investor concern that any AC 
channel stuffing from Gree would impact Midea. In the last AC segment downturn in 2015/2016, Midea 
had not yet developed its own inventory management system. As a result, Midea’s channel inventory was 
high, and sell-in suffered during the market downturn. Today, Midea’s inventory levels are very well 
controlled. 
 
Refrigerators grew 2% in Q3, against 8% for 9M18. Even with revenue slowing, refrigerator ASP 
growth remains resilient, with average ASP increasing 15% YoY. 
 
 
4 
` 
 
Washing machines grew 9% in 9M18, but declined 1% in 3Q18. Performance should improve in 4Q18 
as new high end models are introduced.  Little Swan acquisition unlikely to close until 2019, due to 
required shareholder vote occurring in December. 
 
Small appliances up 5% in 9M18, but up 2% in 3Q18. Small appliance inventory was high in 1H18, but 
inventories are now normalizing. Longer term, high single digit growth should remain achievable 
 
KUKA cut 2018 guidance from EUR 3.5Bn to EUR 3.3Bn due to a weak global robotics market. Impact 
is limited, as KUKA comprises some 12% of Midea’s sales, and a smaller portion of profit. 3Q18 results 
were somewhat encouraging; however, as revenue growth turned to +6.6% growth, an improvement from 
1H18’s -11.2%. Due to RMB depreciation against the Euro, the negative impact is somewhat mitigated on 
Midea’s financials. 
 
Midea’s new high end brand Como will have products in stores by December.
