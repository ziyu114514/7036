MIDEA GROUP [000333.CH]: Monitor arbitrage opportunity 
We believe Midea’s chances of a successful privatisation of Little Swan have 
increased since it updated its offer terms on Nov 21. Midea will exchange 1.1158 
and 0.9056 new shares for each Little Swan A and B share, respectively, after 
an RMB4.0 dividend by Little Swan. This implies that the offer price for Little 
Swan A is RMB48.25, a ~3% premium to yesterday’s close. While Little Swan’s 
privatisation may result in a small EPS dilution, this will be offset by the long-
term benefits stemming from a more efficient corporate structure. We maintain 
our Buy recommendation on Midea and suggest investors monitor the arbitrage 
opportunity. Meanwhile, the new offer structure suggests that each Little Swan-B 
share is worth about HK$45, or a ~9% premium to yesterday’s close of 
HK$41.43. 
 Investment Highlights 
Approval process continues: According to the Nov. 21 announcement, Little 
Swan and Midea have approval from their respective boards for the transaction. 
On Dec. 21, Little Swan and Midea will each hold a shareholders meeting to vote 
on the transaction. If successful, both companies will need further approval from 
the CSRC before the deal can be closed, though this last step is widely 
understood to be a formality. Ultimately, if the deal is successful, the transaction 
is expected to close after the Spring Festival.  
Updated terms introduce a cash component: Midea originally proposed that it 
acquire the remaining 47% of Little Swan by offering 1.211 new shares for each 
Little Swan A share, and 1.0007 new shares for each Little Swan B share. This 
has effectively been revised to 1.1158 and 0.9056 shares for Little Swan A and 
B shares, respectively, with Little Swan issuing a special dividend of RMB 4.0 
per share if the transaction is successful.  
Midea to benefit in the long run: The deal itself may result in ~2% EPS dilution 
in 2019 (a ~5% increase in the number of shares offset by a ~3% increase in net 
profit). In the longer term, Midea will see efficiency gains as a result of fewer 
related-party transactions, reduced resource duplication, and less internal 
competition between the group’s Little Swan, Midea and COLMO washing 
machine brands. We believe a common sales channel and strong branding will 
make Midea washing machines more competitive. 
New offer sweetens the deal for Little Swan shareholders: This new offer 
structure implies that each Little Swan-A share is worth RMB48.25, or a ~3% 
premium to yesterday’s close of RMB46.83. We believe investors should monitor 
this pricing difference to capture arbitrage opportunities. Meanwhile, the new 
offer structure suggests that each Little Swan-B share is worth about HK$45, or 
a 
~9% 
premium 
to 
yesterday’s 
close 
of 
HK$41.43.
