Zhengzhou Yutong Bus (A-Share) (600066 
CH) 
Soft bus sales continue in November 
Event 
 Yutong reported November bus wholesale shipment data after the market 
close on 4 December. 
Impact 
 Soft November sales: Yutong shipped 5,784 buses in November, down 25% 
YoY. Sales of large buses (2,341 units, -10% YoY) and medium buses (2,596 
units, -42% YoY) declined further. Total sales were down 8% YoY to 50,002 
units in 11M18. The weakness was mainly due to a continued decline in the 
demand for conventional buses, especially in the non-urban transit segment. 
Yutong sold ~3,000 new energy buses (E-buses) in November, down from 
4,663 units in November 2017. 
 What is behind our Neutral rating: 1) assuming 40% and 20% subsidy cuts 
for E-buses in 2019-20E. The reported subsidy policy (LINK) indicates that 
there could be an upside with subsidies in 2019; 2) expecting continued 
weakness in bus demand in 2019, especially in conventional bus space and 
overseas markets; 3) elevated impairment losses as well as R&D costs during 
product and technology transition. We would turn more positive on better-than-
expected bus demand, lower-than-expected subsidy cut and higher-than-
expected battery procurement cost cut. 
Action and recommendation 
 We maintain our Neutral rating.
