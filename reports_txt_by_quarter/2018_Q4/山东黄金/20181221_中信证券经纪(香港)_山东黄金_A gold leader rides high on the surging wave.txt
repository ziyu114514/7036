wave

The Company is a leader in China’s gold industry. Its four major mines are 
among the TOP10 gold mines in the country. Asset injection from the 
parent group is expected to support the rapid growth of the Company's 
future gold production, while acquisition of Barrick Gold Corporation’s 
Veladero Gold Mine has kick started the Company’s global expansion 
strategy. As the purest target in the domestic gold industry, the Company
has seen a visible increase in its valuation during the gold price rising 
cycle. We give a 17x EV/EBITDA valuation for the Company, corresponding 
to a reasonable market cap of Rmb84.1bn next year. We raise the target 
price to Rmb3.80, and retain our “BUY” rating. 
 
A leader with purest business in the gold industry enjoys a big upside for 
valuation. Gold business respectively accounts for 99% and 95 of the 
Company’s aggregate operating revenue and gross margin. As the purest gold 
target in China, the Company's market performance is highly correlated with 
gold price. The Company's valuation level is expected to increase significantly 
in the gold price rising cycle, and the Company's future gold production growth 
is highly deterministic, which further supports its valuation level.   
 
Excellent resource endowment supports the Company's rapid growth in 
gold production. The four main mines of the Company are among the TOP10 
gold mines in China, with 850 tonnes in gross gold reserves and a gold output 
of 29.39 tonnes in 2017, ranking first in the country. Their mining costs are 
lower than the average in China. All these four main mines have plans to 
expand production in the future. Meanwhile, Shandong Gold Group, a major 
shareholder of the Company, has remarkable reserve increases, with gold 
reserves as high as 1,700 tonnes. In 2017, its output of gold outside the listed 
company stood at 5.3 tonnes. With the injection of assets from the parent 
group, the Company's gold production will see direct growth in the future, with 
its long-term output expected to reach 50 tonnes, which will support the 
Company's rapid earnings growth.  
 
Acquisition of Veladero Gold Mine kick starts global expansion. The
Company acquired Barrick Gold Corporation’s Veladero Gold Mine in 2017,
which increases its gold reserves to 987 tonnes. Veladero Gold Mine is
expected to contribute more than 9 tonnes to the Company’s gold output in
2018. The injection of mature gold assets supports the rapid growth of the 
Company's gold production and earnings, which will open up its strategic 
expansion worldwide and offer a broad upside for future growth. 
 
Potential risks: Gold price volatility, and less-than-expected gold production. 
 
Investment advice: Fast-growing gold production and an upward gold price 
cycle combine to significantly push up the Company’s earnings. Given the 
Company’s fair value change in 2018 and potential incremental gold assets in 
2020, we lift our forecasts for the Company’s 2018-2020 attribute net profits to 
Rmb1,204mn/1,652mn/ 2,070mn, implying EPS of Rmb0.54/0.75/0.94 (vs. 
former EPS forecasts of Rmb0.61/0.75/0.87) respectively. Taking into account 
the increases in debts and financial costs due to the acquisition of overseas
