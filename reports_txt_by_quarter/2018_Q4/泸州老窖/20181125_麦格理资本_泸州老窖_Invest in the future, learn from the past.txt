Invest in the future, learn from the past 
Key points 
 Premium liquor National Cellar 1573 is making a comeback, boosting sales 
and gross profit margin, according to management. 
 The company is investing heavily in marketing expenses, while controlling 
channel inventory to be less than 2 months. 
 Capacity expansion ongoing; high dividend payout ratio. 
 
 
Outlook 
 We visited Luzhou Laojiao and talked with management. As one of China’s 
oldest liquor manufacturers, its premium product National Cellar 1573 is sold 
at a retail price of Rmb1,099/bottle on par with Wuliangye Yibin’s (A-Share) 
(000858 CH, Rmb50.69, Neutral, TP: Rmb52.30) Puwu.  
 As pledged at its annual general meeting in June 2018, the company aims to 
regain its top 3 spot in the Baiju industry in 2020 and lift its revenue to 
Rmb30bn in 2020E (Rmb10.4bn in 2017). National Cellar 1573, mid-range 
products, and health and other innovative liquors are each expected to make a 
one-third contribution to revenue. 
Key findings 
 National Cellar 1573 comes back, boosting sales and gross profit margin. 
Amid the recovery of the baijiu industry and consumption upgrade trend, the 
sales percentage of its high-end products leapfrogged to 52% in 1H18 from 
22% in 2015. According to industry experts, 1573 won back its historical 
market share in 2017 and gained more in 2018. As a result, GPM rose to 
73.9% in 1H18 from 49.4% in 2015. Meanwhile, the ex-factory price of 1573 
was lifted twice in 2017, by 6% and 9% in March and July, respectively. The 
company plans to become more prudent on price hikes and to conduct a 
pricing strategy following Wuliangye. 
 Invest in the future, while learning from the past. To expand in the high-
end market, the company continues to invest in marketing. As a result, its A&P 
expenses ratio continued to increase 2.4ppt YoY to 22.5% in 9M18, higher 
than 5.4% of Moutai and 10.5% of Wuliangye. However, gross margin 
expansion driven by product mix upgrade more than offset the increase in 
SG&A, and operating margin improved 3.2ppt YoY to 40.7%. Moreover, post 
the hiccup in the baijiu industry and ineffectual pricing strategy, Laojiao rebuilt 
its sales team in 2014 by product in lieu of regions. The company learned 
lessons and is managing channel inventory under 2 months currently. 
 Capacity expansion ongoing; high dividend payout ratio. In September 
2017, it raised Rmb3bn through non-public share offerings to expand 35k tons 
of basic liquor capacity and 100k tons of storage capacity by the end of 2020.  
Stripping out this Rmb3bn from cash and equivalents, its net gearing ratio 
would be 36% in FY17. The company also paid out 71.6% of net profit last 
year, up 2.8ppt from 68.8% in FY16. This is higher than the 51.0% and 52.2% 
payout ratios of Moutai and Wuliangye in FY17, respectively. 
Financials, valuations, and risks 
 9M18 revenue of Rmb9,263m, up 27% YoY, with net profit up 38% YoY to 
Rmb2,743m. 3Q18 sales grew 31% and net profit rose 45%.The stock is 
trading at a 14x FY19E PER, compared with domestic peers’ 15x FY19E, both 
based on Bloomberg consensus estimates.
