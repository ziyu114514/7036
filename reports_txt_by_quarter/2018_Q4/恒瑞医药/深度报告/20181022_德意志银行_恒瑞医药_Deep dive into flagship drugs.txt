We analyzed competitive landscape of Hengrui’s top 10 drugs including Aitan 
(apatinib), Aibeining, Aisu, and atracurium series. All together, they took in 
66% of total revenue in 1H18 by Rx data.  Hengrui maintained its No. 1 rank in 
many of the chemical classes in the past 4.5 years. Also, most of the 10 drugs 
experienced single-digit price cuts during the period, except for Aitan, whose 
ASP was slashed 37% in 1H18 upon NRDL entry. We now model 21% and 
27% growth for net income in 2018 and 2019, respectively. 
Expect limited impact from BE drug tender; 3 drugs involved  
We expect limited impact on Hengrui from the drug tender in 11 large cities. 
Related products include dexmedetomidine, irbesartan, and nab paclitaxel, 
which accounted for 11%, 1%, and 0% of revenue in 1H18, respectively, per 
Rx data. Whether dexmedetomidine can pass BE before this tender remains 
uncertain now. No matter whether Hengrui wins or loses the tender, we 
estimate the impact on total revenue would be from -1.5% to -1% in 11 cities 
only, while blended impact would be no more than 0.5% in absolute value. 
Going forward, we believe Hengrui holds a relatively robust franchise with 
more focus on innovative drugs vs. competitors. 
Model revisions, including minor changes to historical data 
The largest challenge for modeling Hengrui is the lack of sales data, as the 
company does not report individual drug revenue at all. While Hengrui 
primarily replies upon its direct sales force, public data also indicates Hengrui 
used third party CSOs (contract sales organizations), which explains the 
discrepancy between Rx data and reported revenues on specific therapeutic 
classes. We took time to reconcile these and believe our present model 
properly reflects Rx trends.  
Decrease price target to RMB73.9 from RMB85.5; risks 
We decrease our PT mainly due to sector re-rating. Our PT is based on 55x 
2019E EPS, vs. 64x previously. We believe Hengrui deserves a premium in the 
multiple given the superior value of its products and its strong pipeline; its A-
share peers are trading at 29x 2019E EPS with 20% growth in 2020 (vs. 27% 
we model for Hengrui). Key risks include regulatory delays, setback in gastric 
and ESCC for PD-1, as well as price cut and competition.

Summary 
DB analysis for top 10 drugs 
We picked top 10 drugs according to Rx data and evaluated competitive 
landscape 
for 
each 
drug. 
In 
our 
calculation, 
we 
standardized 
all 
dosages/formulations. We also use 3M rolling average for market share and 
ASP data. Our key takeaways include the following: 
 
Most of the top 10 drugs delivered healthy growth in 1H18, while 
Aiheng lagged. 
 
Out of top 10, Hengrui has a dominant position for 9 drugs in terms of 
market share. 
 
Despite the threats of potential new rivals in each generic class, for 
instance, iodixanol, sevoflurane and irinotecan, we believe Hengrui is 
able to manage the risks well, supported by strong marketing, high-
quality products, and abundant pipeline.

Deep dive into flagship 
drugs 
Aisu (docetaxel) 
 
Sales growth of Aisu improved to 23% in 1H18, vs. 13%/1% in 
2017/2016, respectively. In our view, this is partly related to removal of 
restrictions to 2nd line treatment in national reimbursement last year. 
 
Aisu was also taking more market share from early 2017 with 
relatively small price cut (4% in 1H18).

Aibeining (dexmedetomidine) 
 
Aibeining is the largest drug of Hengrui by our estimate and holds the 
majority of dexmedetomidine market in China.  
 
According to Rx data, this drug accounted for 11% of total revenue in 
1H18, and it grew 14% YoY during the period. We also highlight the 
magnitude of price cut increased to 7% in 1H18 from 2% in 2016, 
which we believe was due to intensified competition.

Aitan (apatinib) 
 
According to Rx data, Aitan accounted for only 4% of Hengrui’s total 
sales in 1H18, vs. 11% by DBe. We highlight that the reason behind 
the difference is that a large portion of Aitan is sold in drug stores. 
 
We continue to expect very strong growth of Aitan in the next few 
quarters.

Atracurium series 
 
Atracurium series includes cisatracurium besylate and atracurium 
besilate, and the former takes up the majority of sales by Rx data. 
Additionally, atracurium besilate is an exclusive drug of Hengrui. 
 
Growth of cisatracurium besylate remained solid, while sales of 
atracurium besilate shrunk during the period.  
 
Hengrui maintained prices quite well and experienced lower price cuts 
vs. major competitors. ASP of cisatracurium besylate and atracurium 
besilate declined moderately by 5% and 6% YoY, respectively, in 1H18.

Ioversol 
 
Hengrui’s ioversol was dominant in the market with 94% share in 1H18 
and contributed 8% of total revenue by Rx data. This product delivered 
CAGR14-17 of 20%.  
 
We see impact of both volume and price on revenue growth deceleration, 
and price cut was 7% and 6% in 2017 and 1H18, respectively.

Iodixanol 
 
Hengrui’s iodixanol is another key drug in the contrast agents segment 
and accounted for 8% of total revenue in 1H18. Rx data indicated that 
it had been gaining market share since 2014, and charged at the 
lowest national price since 2015. 
 
Sales growth of Hengrui’s iodixanol outperformed most of its flagship 
drugs, with CAGR14-17 of 62%. We remain optimistic on contrast 
agents franchise and anticipate strong growth momentum ahead.

Kaiteli (sevoflurane) 
 
Sales growth of Kaiteli has slowed since 2015 according to Rx data, 
while we believe its export revenue should have expanded rapidly.  
 
Hengrui continued to be the market leader in sevoflurane in China and 
retained over 60% market share in the past 4.5 years. We anticipate 
more fierce competition in the future when the third player enters the 
market, as Haixi Lianhe Pharma’s generic is under regulatory review.

Aili (irinotecan) 
 
Sales growth of Aili accelerated to 29% in 1H18 from 4% in 2015 per 
Rx data. This might be owing to removal of restrictions to 2nd line

Aiheng (oxaliplatin) 


"Deutsche Bank"). Though the information herein is believed to be reliable and has been obtained from public sources 
believed to be reliable, Deutsche Bank makes no representation as to its accuracy or completeness. Hyperlinks to third-
party websites in this report are provided for reader convenience only. Deutsche Bank neither endorses the content nor 
is

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this 
report, or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche 
Bank 
may 
act 
as 
principal 
for 
its 
own 
account 
or 
as 
agent 
for 
another 
person. 
 
Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its own 
account or with customers, in a manner inconsistent with the views taken in this research report. Others within 
Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staff and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those 
taken in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, 
equity-linked analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication 
may differ from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of differing time horizons, methodologies, 
perspectives or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its affiliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers 
it writes on. Analysts are paid in part based on the profitability of Deutsche Bank AG and its affiliates, which includes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do 
not necessarily reflect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides 
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts 
sometimes have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. 
Some trade ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website (https://research.db.com/Research/) , 
and can be found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company’s page. A Catalyst Call represents a 
high-conviction belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a specified sector 
over a time frame of no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may 
occasionally discuss with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that 
reference catalysts or events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities 
discussed in this report, which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return 
or investment return as described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to 
otherwise notify a recipient thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the 
frequency of changes in market conditions and in both general and company-specific economic prospects make it 
difficult to update research at defined intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the 
Research Department Management, and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is 
provided for informational purposes only and does not take into account the particular investment objectives, financial 
situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not an offer or a solicitation of an offer to buy or sell any financial 
instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy. Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of 
the analyst’s judgment. The financial instruments discussed in this report may not be suitable for all investors, and 
investors must make their own informed investment decisions. Prices and availability of financial instruments are 
subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead to losses as a result of price fluctuations and 
other factors. If a financial instrument is denominated in a currency other than an investor's currency, a change in 
exchange rates may adversely affect the investment. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. 
Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated. Unless otherwise indicated, prices are 
current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and 
other 
vendors.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise 
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash 
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a 
loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the 
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse 
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation 
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency 
convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of positions), and 
settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-income 
instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX 
depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by 
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of 
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons 
indexed to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency 
that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks

options

addition 
to 
the 
risks 
related 
to 
rates 
movements. 
 
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The 
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their tax 
position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should take 
expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this 
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the 
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the 
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not 
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of 
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp. If you are unable to 
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document. 
 
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i) 
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by 
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and 
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed 
exchange controls, which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are 
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.  
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the 
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at 
https://research.db.com/Research/ on each company’s research page. Investors are strongly encouraged to review this 
information before investing.
