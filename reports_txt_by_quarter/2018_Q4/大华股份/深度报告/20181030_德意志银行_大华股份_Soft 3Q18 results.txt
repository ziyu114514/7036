Soft 3Q18 results
Aiming to be the long-term winner in the technology convergence trend
Dahua reported weak 3Q18 operating proﬁts (growth deceleration and opex hike)
but EPS was saved by non-op gains (forex gain, etc). Dahua regards the growth
deceleration as a temporary issue (China deleveraging policy and trade war
uncertainties) and reiterates its long-term positive view on the industry. Dahua
believes the convergence trend in AI, 5G and security surveillance technologies
will quickly expand the industry TAM, and that it can capitalize on this trend by
leveraging its total solution products. Reiterating Buy rating.
Soft 3Q18 operating results: top-line miss + rising opex
Dahua reported 3Q18 EPS of CNY0.17 (+4% YoY; -39% QoQ) and operating proﬁt
of CNY167mn (-53% YoY; -75% QoQ) on sales of CNY5.2bn (+23% YoY; - 15%
QoQ). The sharp operating proﬁt decline stems from 1) softer-than-expected top-
line growth (sales missed Bloomberg consensus by 10%) and 2) an opex hike. The
ﬁrm attributes the growth deceleration to the trade war uncertainty (impacting
N. America sales), and the Chinese government's deleveraging policy. Saved by
a non-op gain of CNY273mn (higher forex gain, tax rebate, and reduced asset
write-oﬀ expenses), EPS missed expectations slightly, by 2%. Despite sales on the
decline, opex rose 18% QoQ to CNY1.7bn, owing to increased sales/marketing
investments for overseas markets and R&D expenses for total solution products.
4Q18 outlook and other key Q&A
Dahua expects 4Q18 net proﬁt to fall within the range of CNY815mn to
CNY1.17bn. The mid-point of the guidance suggests net proﬁt of CNY993mn
(+106% QoQ; +6% YoY), driven by the seasonal demand. 4Q tends to be the peak
season of the industry. We summarize key Q&As during the investor call as below:
1) Long-term industry outlook and growth drivers? The convergency of AI, 5G and
security surveillance technologies will create many new business opportunities
for Dahua in areas such as smart city, smart home, etc. 2) Threat from new
competitors (Huawei, and Internet giants)? The aforementioned convergence
trend will bring in new competitors as well, but the market will be big enough
for multiple players to grow. In addition, Dahua is one of the few ﬁrms that
can provide total solution capabilities (front-end/back-end hardware, software/
algorithm, service and channel), which serve as its core competency. 3) Why
negative cash ﬂows in 3Q18? Prolonged payment terms from some clients and
government projects.

Valuation and risks
We maintain our Buy rating, but reduce our 2018-20 EPS forecasts by 10%-13%
to price in higher opex and slower sales growth assumptions for overseas markets
(negative impacts from trade war). We trim our TP from CNY24.5 to CNY22.5.
Our TP is based on 0.8x PEG, or 20x 2019E EPS. 0.8x PEG, which is in line with
regional peers. Risks: market share loss, weak orders from solution projects, and
forex.

If you use the services of Deutsche Bank in connection with a purchase or sale of a security that is discussed in this report,
or is included or discussed in another communication (oral or written) from a Deutsche Bank analyst, Deutsche Bank may
act as principal for its own account or as agent for another person.

Deutsche Bank may consider this report in deciding to trade as principal. It may also engage in transactions, for its

Deutsche Bank, including strategists, sales staﬀ and other analysts, may take views that are inconsistent with those taken
in this research report. Deutsche Bank issues a variety of research products, including fundamental analysis, equity-linked
analysis, quantitative analysis and trade ideas. Recommendations contained in one type of communication may diﬀer
from recommendations contained in others, whether as a result of diﬀering time horizons, methodologies, perspectives
or otherwise. Deutsche Bank and/or its aﬃliates may also be holding debt or equity securities of the issuers it writes

Opinions, estimates and projections constitute the current judgment of the author as of the date of this report. They do
not necessarily reﬂect the opinions of Deutsche Bank and are subject to change without notice. Deutsche Bank provides
liquidity for buyers and sellers of securities issued by the companies it covers. Deutsche Bank research analysts sometimes
have shorter-term trade ideas that may be inconsistent with Deutsche Bank's existing longer-term ratings. Some trade
ideas for equities are listed as Catalyst Calls on the Research Website ( https://research.db.com/Research/ ) , and can be
found on the general coverage list and also on the covered company ’ s page. A Catalyst Call represents a high-conviction
belief by an analyst that a stock will outperform or underperform the market and/or a speciﬁed sector over a time frame of
no less than two weeks and no more than three months. In addition to Catalyst Calls, analysts may occasionally discuss
with our clients, and with Deutsche Bank salespersons and traders, trading strategies or ideas that reference catalysts or
events that may have a near-term or medium-term impact on the market price of the securities discussed in this report,
which impact may be directionally counter to the analysts' current 12-month view of total return or investment return as
described herein. Deutsche Bank has no obligation to update, modify or amend this report or to otherwise notify a recipient
thereof if an opinion, forecast or estimate changes or becomes inaccurate. Coverage and the frequency of changes in
market conditions and in both general and company-speciﬁc economic prospects make it diﬃcult to update research at
deﬁned intervals. Updates are at the sole discretion of the coverage analyst or of the Research Department Management,
and the majority of reports are published at irregular intervals. This report is provided for informational purposes only and
does not take into account the particular investment objectives, ﬁnancial situations, or needs of individual clients. It is not
an oﬀer or a solicitation of an oﬀer to buy or sell any ﬁnancial instruments or to participate in any particular trading strategy.
Target prices are inherently imprecise and a product of the analyst ’ s judgment. The ﬁnancial instruments discussed

Prices and availability of ﬁnancial instruments are subject to change without notice, and investment transactions can lead
to losses as a result of price ﬂuctuations and other factors. If a ﬁnancial instrument is denominated in a currency other
than an investor's currency, a change in exchange rates may adversely aﬀect the investment. Past performance is not
necessarily indicative of future results. Performance calculations exclude transaction costs, unless otherwise indicated.
Unless otherwise indicated, prices are current as of the end of the previous trading session and are sourced from local
exchanges via Reuters, Bloomberg and other vendors. Data is also sourced from Deutsche Bank, subject companies, and
other parties.

Macroeconomic ﬂuctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay ﬁxed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long ﬁxed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
ﬂows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash ﬂows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash ﬂow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inﬂation, ﬁscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for diﬀerent types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of proﬁts and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of ﬁxed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash ﬂows to inﬂation, to
FX depreciation, or to speciﬁed interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index ﬁxings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper ﬁxing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where ﬂoating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for ﬁxed coupons. Funding in a currency that diﬀers
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
??
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and ﬁnancial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of
Standardized Options”, at http://www.optionsclearing.com/about/publications/character-risks.jsp . If you are unable to
access the website, please contact your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large ﬂuctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be aﬀected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could aﬀect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are aﬀected by the
currency of an underlying security, eﬀectively assume currency risk.
