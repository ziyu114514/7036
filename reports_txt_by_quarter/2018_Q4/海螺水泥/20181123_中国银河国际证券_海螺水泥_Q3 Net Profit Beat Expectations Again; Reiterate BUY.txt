China Cement Sector 
Conch Cement reported a recurring net profit of RMB7.7bn in Q3 2018, up 149% YoY. 
Sales volume grew impressively by 22.6% YoY to 93.9m tonnes, including about 17m 
tonnes from the trading platform. Blended ASP (cement and clinker) rose from 
RMB316/tonne in Q2 2018 to RMB328/tonne in Q3 2018. Q3 2018 net profit implies our 
Q4 2018E net profit is about RMB7.3bn, which looks low since Q4 is usually a peak 
season for volume and price. Therefore, we raise our 2018E/2019E EPS by 5%/8.2%. 
We reiterate our BUY rating, but lower our H-share target price from HK$65 (2.7x 
2018E PBR) to HK$57.50 (2.37x 2018E PBR, 1 standard deviation above the average) 
to reflect the lower risk appetite of investors after the recent sharp market correction (A-
share target price: RMB47, 6% discount to our H-share target price, based on the aver-
age discount in the past few years).  
Investment Highlights 
Q3 sales volume grew 22.6% YoY. The Company sold 76.9m tonnes of cement and 
clinker it produced in Q3. Thanks to strong sales volume from its trading platform, total 
sales volume in Q3 was 93.9m tonnes, up 22.6% YoY. Blended ASP rose from 
RMB316/tonne in Q2 2018 to RMB328/tonne in Q3 2018, which is better than ex-
pected, since Q3 is usually a low season due to rainy weather.  
Gross profit per tonne dropped due to trading business. Gross profit per tonne fell 
from RMB147 in Q2 2018 to RMB127 in Q3 2018 although the ASP increased QoQ. 
The decline was distorted by sales volume from the trading platform, which accounted 
for 18% of total sales volume in Q3. Overall, it is still positive, leading to 149% growth in 
Q3 recurring net profit. In addition, the trading platform also enhances the pricing power 
of the Company in some regions. 
Q4 outlook remains upbeat. Based on the latest price and inventory level information 
from Digital Cement, cement prices in east and south central China still maintained a 
moderate uptrend (Figure 2 and 3), while inventory levels remained low (Figure 4 and 
5), which should bode well for Q4 2018 performance. 
Upward earnings revision. Q3 2018 net profit suggests our Q4 2018E net profit is 
about RMB7.3bn (Q3: RMB7.7bn), which looks low since Q4 is usually a peak season 
for volume and price. Therefore, we lift our 2018E/2019E EPS by 5%/8.2%. After the 
recent correction triggered by overall market weakness, Conch Cement-H is trading at 
6.2x 2018E PER, with a 7.2% dividend yield, which looks too bearish with a net cash 
balance sheet. 
Q3 Net Profit Beat Expectations Again; Reiterate BUY
