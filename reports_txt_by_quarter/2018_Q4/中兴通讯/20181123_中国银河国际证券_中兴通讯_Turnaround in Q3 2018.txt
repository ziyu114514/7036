ZTE Corporation [0763.HK;000063.CH] 
ZTE Corporation (ZTE) posted a net profit of RMB564.5m in Q3 2018, which is at mid point of the 
previous guidance range. ZTE guided a net loss of RMB6.2bn-7.2bn for 2018, which implies a net 
profit of RMB64m-RMB1.0bn for Q4 2018. We acknowledge that the recovery is somewhat slower 
than expected, but the Company is still on the track to recover from the impact of the US export ban. 
We believe that ZTE will be one of the major beneficiaries of 5G investment in China. We still be-
lieve that ZTE’s recovery will be driven mainly driven by a pick-up in CAPEX by local telecom opera-
tors, and government and corporate business. But the consumer products segment is expected to 
lag behind, since it is more reliant on overseas markets. Shares of ZTE may come under pressure 
after the Q3 2018 results announcement, given the slower-than-expected recovery. But we still be-
lieve infrastructure-related segments such as 5G will be the main investment themes in 2019, and 
ZTE is a major name in the infrastructure-related hardware providers listed in HK and China. We still 
believe that market confidence in ZTE will be restored. Apart from the recovery in operating perfor-
mance, news flow on 5G development in China is a major share price catalyst for ZTE. We maintain 
our BUY rating with a target price of HK$18.67, based on 14x 2019E PER, lower than the Compa-
ny’s historical mean of 22x. Our target price for ZTE-A (000063.CH) is RMB21.55, and we upgrade 
our rating from HOLD to BUY on ZTE-A. 
Investment Highlights 
 
Q3 2018: Back to profitability. ZTE’s turnover dropped 14.3% YoY, from RMB22,569m in Q3 
2017 to RMB19,332m in Q3 2018. The YoY decline in turnover in Q3 2018 was less than the 
27% YoY drop in 1H 2018. The Q3 2018 turnover figures were still distorted by the US export 
ban. The Company reported a net profit of RMB564.5m in Q3 2018, at the mid-point of previ-
ous guidance. This represents a 50.4% YoY drop from RMB1,138.4m in Q3 2017, but a turna-
round from a net loss of RMB7,824.2m in 1H 2018. ZTE’s blended gross profit margin im-
proved to 36.5% in Q3 2018, a multi-year high, in our view, due to a higher contribution from 
the carrier network segment, which has a higher gross profit margin. ZTE’s Q3 results were 
also impacted by some one-off items, such as RMB200m in legal costs, impairment of credits & 
assets, and a RMB251m mark-to-market loss on investments. ZTE’s core operating perfor-
mance is solid excluding the impact of these one-off items. Higher R&D expenses, in our view, 
are another reason for slower recovery progress. R&D expenses were RMB3,465.2m in Q3 
2018 vs. RMB5060.6m in 1H 2018. However, we believe that R&D expenses invested now will 
translate into business opportunities in the coming years. ZTE issued a profit alert for 2018, 
which guided a net loss of RMB6.2bn-7.2bn. This implies net profit will be in range of RMB60m 
to RMB1bn. We still expect ZTE to report a QoQ increase in net profit in Q4 2018, as the Com-
pany is on the right track to recovery.  
 
Local market potential to drive recovery. We share the view that the market might have 
concerns about the growth outlook for ZTE, given potential market share loss in overseas mar-
kets in both the equipment and consumer products segments. We believe the consumer prod-
ucts segment will lag behind, but equipment and non-operator business should drive the recov-
ery in Q4 2018 and 2019, especially given 5G development in China. Since 5G is an area sup-
ported by the Chinese government, it will create growth potential for equipment makers such as 
ZTE. In addition to wireless equipment, ZTE has invested in new technologies, which will allow 
the Company to benefit from the adoption of new technologies like NB-IoT.  
 
Downward earnings adjustment for 2018. We revised down our net profit forecast for 2018 
after ZTE’s Q3 2018 results announcement. We keep our 2019 net profit forecasts, as we be-
lieve the Company is on the recovery trend. ZTE shares may come under pressure after the 
Q3 2018 results announcement, which in our view, offers a good buying opportunity, especially 
since infrastructure-related themes will be the focus in the hardware segment in 2019 & 2020.
