SUMMARY. On 7 Aug, PAB reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 15.4bn, up 15.2% 
YoY and accounting for 55.7% of consensus full-year estimate. 2Q19 PPoP 
growth was 20.8% YoY, driven by robust net interest income (+22.0% YoY) and 
trading gains. Despite prudent provision charge (+23.2% YoY) in 2Q19, earning 
growth accelerated to 17.4% YoY, which is likely the highest among nationwide 
banks. As a result, 1H19 annualized ROE recovered 0.6ppt YoY to 13.6%. We 
expect sustainable above-peers earning growth (12-15% in FY19-21E) for PAB, 
on the back of resilient NIM and improving asset quality. Reiterate BUY. 
 Results positive: 1) NIM widened by 18bp QoQ to 2.71%, thanks to higher 
retail loan yield (+38bp QoQ) and lower cost of funding, esp. interbank 
borrowing. PAB further lifted retail loan proportion to 58.8% as of 2Q19, on 
faster growth of credit card overdrafts (3.8% QoQ) vs total loan growth (1.5% 
QoQ); 2) NPL ratio was down 5bp QoQ to 1.68%, with 1.4% QoQ 
decrease in NPL balance. NPL formation also retreated to the lowest level of 
1.3% in the past five quarters. We believe PAB’s NPL ratio could continue to 
decline in 2H19, as both SML and overdue loan ratio (leading indicators for 
asset quality) dropped; 3) NPL recognition was more stringent, as NPL / 
>90-day overdue loans rose to 113% in 2Q19 from 104 in 1Q19; 4) 
Provision coverage climbed 12ppt QoQ to four-year high of 183%, despite 
lower credit cost; 5) CAR improved 112bps QoQ to 12.6%, after the Bank 
issued RMB 30bn tier-2 capital bond in Apr. Capital position would be further 
strengthened after the conversion of RMB 26bn CB; 6) Steady growth in 
retail client base (3.7% QoQ) and retail AUM (5.5% QoQ), and continued 
migration to wealth and PB clients. 
 Results negative: 2Q19 net fee income declined 5.5% YoY, mainly due to 
weaker fees from investment banking and asset custody businesses, 
notwithstanding robust growth in settlement and agency fees.  
 Maintain BUY and RMB 17.0 TP. We expect positive share price reaction 
after the strong set of results. PAB currently trades at 0.95x FY19E P/B. We 
keep earning forecast unchanged, and our RMB 17.0 TP is based on a 
GGM-derived target P/B of 1.2x and FY19E BVPS of RMB 14.2.
