SUMMARY. PAB had significant achievement in growing client base and AUM 
since kicking off its full-scale retail transformation in 2016. We expect the Bank 
to deliver all-round improvement in financial performance going forward. Initiate 
coverage with BUY. 
 Huge growth potential with client base expansion and upgrade. 
Leveraging on Ping An Group’s (PAG) integrated platform, comprehensive 
product spectrum, and extensive distribution network, Ping An Bank (PAB) 
was able to achieve a rapid growth of retail client base (44% CAGR in 2016-
18). The Bank’s strategic focus has now shifted to growing high-net-worth 
individuals that offer greater business potential, due to broader financial 
demand and higher stickiness. A key initiative is to incorporate Ping An 
Trust’s wealth management team into the Bank’s private banking (PB) 
division. This would further boost PAB’s AUM and fee income growth.  
 Resilient margin amid interest liberalization. China banks would continue 
to face margin pressure, as PBoC gradually liberalizes interest rates. Banks 
with higher retail loan exposure should enjoy stronger pricing power and 
superior NIM trend. As of 2018, PAB’s proportion of retail loans was 58%, 
highest in the sector. In contrary to most peers whose retail loans are 
primarily mortgage, PAB owns a balanced retail loan portfolio (incl. mortgage, 
credit cards, personal business loans, and other consumption loans), 
offering itself more bargaining power and flexibility on pricing. 
 Benign asset quality outlook despite macro uncertainties. With a retail- 
oriented loan mix, PAB is well positioned to enjoy greater risk diversification 
and less cyclicality to macro-economy. Apart from some fluctuation in NPL 
ratio of personal business loans, asset quality of other retail loans has 
remained solid over time, reflecting PAB’s decent market penetration. As of 
1Q19, PAB’s NPL ratio and provision coverage stood at 1.73% (-2bps QoQ) 
and 170.6% (+15.4ppts QoQ). We see an early sign of asset quality turning 
point. With stricter loan classification, the Bank’s NPL formation and credit 
costs could further retreat in coming quarters. 
 Initiate with BUY rating and RMB 17.0 TP. PAB currently trades at 0.96x 
FY19E P/B, vs 0.86x for A-share bank average and 1.59x for CMB-A. There 
is foreseeable earnings and valuation upside, as the Bank gets rid of the 
legacy asset quality burden. Our RMB 17.0 TP is based on a GGM-derived 
target P/B of 1.2x and FY19E BVPS of RMB 14.2.

Investment Highlights 
Huge growth potential with expansion and upgrade of client base 
Leveraging on PAG’s integrated financial platform, comprehensive product spectrum, and 
extensive distribution network, PAB was able to achieve a rapid growth of retail client 
base (44% CAGR in 2016-18). Around 40% of customer acquisition was through the 
migration from various channels of PAG during the period. As of 1Q19, PAB’s total no. of 
retail clients reached 87mn, of which 0.76% and 0.04% were Wealth clients (RMB 
500,000 AUM) and PB clients (RMB 6mn AUM), respectively.  
Since 4Q18, PAB’s strategic focus has shifted from expanding client base to cultivating 
high-net-worth individuals. Such kind of clients could offer greater business potential, 
given their broader financial demand and higher stickiness. In Oct 2018, the Bank 
announced to incorporate Ping An Trust’s wealth management team into its PB division. 
This could greatly boost PAB’s AUM and fee income growth. As indicated in Figure 10, 
the proportion of Wealth and PB clients as of total retail clients started to pick up in 2H18.

More resilient margin amid interest liberalization 
As the PBoC gradually pushes for interest rate liberalization in China, banks’ NIM would 
continue to face downward pressure, due to competition in loan and deposit. We believe 
banks with higher retail loan exposure would enjoy stronger pricing power, therefore 
outperform during the interest liberalization cycle.   
China started monetary easing with a series of cuts in benchmark interest rate in late-
2014, and the NIM of PAB and CMB (two most typical retail banks in China) has been 
outrunning sector average since 2015. As of 2018, PAB had the highest proportion of 
retail loans of 58%, followed by 54% for PSBC and 51% for CMB.  
We do not see any advantage in corporate banking for PAB vs sector peers, but its retail 
business generates notably higher loan yields. In contrary to most large banks whose 
retail loans are mainly allocated to mortgage, PAB has been consistently exploring credit 
cards, car loans, and personal business loans, and owns a more balanced retail loan 
portfolio. Non-mortgage retail loans offer banks more bargaining power and flexibility on 
pricing, resulting in more resilient loan yields and NIM.

Benign asset quality trend despite rising macro uncertainties 
Similar to peers, PAB’s corporate NPL ratio (2.59%) is significantly higher than retail NPL 
ratio (1.10%) as of 1Q19, and corporate NPLs contributed to majority (63%) of the Bank’s 
total NPLs. That said, the Bank has notably reduced the proportion of risky corporate 
loans (with NPL ratio > 3%), mainly to manufacturing and commercial sectors, to 11.1% 
in 2018 from 21.7% in 2016. More importantly, with the highest proportion of retail loans 
(58%), PAB is well positioned to enjoy greater risk diversification and less cyclicality to 
macro-economy.  
Looking into the breakdown of retail loans, apart from a volatile NPL ratio of personal 
business loans, asset quality of other retail loans has remained quite solid over time, 
reflecting PAB’s decent penetration into retail market.     
As of 1Q19, PAB’s NPL ratio and provision coverage stood at 1.73% and 170.6%, down 
2bps QoQ and up 15.4ppts QoQ, respectively. We see an early sign of asset quality 
turning point. With more stringent NPL recognition practice, the Bank’s NPL formation 
and credit costs could further retreat in coming quarters.

Company background 
Headquartered in Shenzhen, PAB was formed in 2011 by merging Shenzhen 
Development Bank Co., Ltd. (SZDB) and the former Ping An Bank, a subsidiary of Ping 
An Insurance (Group) Company of China, Ltd. (or “Ping An Group”, 2318 HK, NR). As of 
31 Dec 2018, the Bank operated 1,057 outlets nationwide and had 34.6 thousand 
employees.  
One of the Bank’s predecessors, SZDB, was established and incorporated as a joint-
stock bank in 1987 through consolidating six rural credit cooperatives in Shenzhen. In Apr 
1988, SZDB went public on Shenzhen Stock Exchange and became the first listed bank 
in China. The other predecessor, the former Ping An Bank, which used to be Shenzhen 
Commercial Bank, was the first city commercial bank in China. 
As of 31 Mar 2019, Ping An Group remained the controlling shareholder of PAB, holding 
57.94% of the Bank’s total equity interest. The parent company was established as the 
first joint-stock insurer in China in 1988, and has developed into a financial conglomerate 
consisting of insurance, banking, securities, trust, asset management business, etc., 
serving over 70mn customers.

The core “3+2+1” framework. PAB’s retail business is underpinned by a unique 
framework, which comprises: three modules - basic retail, consumer finance & private 
banking; two competencies - cost & risk management; and one internal driver - Artificial 
Intelligence (AI). Basic retail mainly supports customer acquisition and volume growth, 
while consumer finance and PB are major profit and AUM generators.

Earnings Forecasts 
Expect 12-15% YoY net profit growth in FY19-21E  
We forecast a 13.6% CAGR for PAB’s revenue in FY19-21E, mainly driven by healthy 
asset expansion and largely stable NIM. Non-interest income would continue to pick up 
on strong bank card and agency service fees. Wealth management fee is likely to record 
positive growth in FY19 after a consecutive decline in FY17-18, as the Bank finished 
transformation of the business in accordance to the new asset management rule. 
Given PAB’s relatively high credit costs and strengthened provision buffer in 1Q19, we 
see great earnings resilience should asset quality continue to improve. We expect net 
profit to grow by 12.2%/13.4%/15.3% in FY19/20/21, up from 7.0% in FY18. As a result, 
ROE is estimated to bottom out in FY19 and stay in the uptrend in FY20-21.

CMBI vs consensus estimates  
Our revenue and net profit forecasts are 2-4% higher than Bloomberg consensus in 
FY19-20, and our ROE forecasts are 0.4ppt above consensus for the same period. This 
is mainly due to our more bullish view on PAB’s NIM and credit cost trend, as we believe 
the Bank’s successful retail transformation will lead to notable improvement in financial 
performance in coming years.

Valuation and Recommendation 
Initiate with BUY rating and TP of RMB 17.0 
We use Gordon Growth Model to derive the TP for PAB. Our key assumptions include: 1) 
Market risk premium of 8.2%; 2) Risk free rate of 3.2%, 3) Sustainable ROE of 13.5%; 4) 
Long-term growth rate of 3.0%. Our TP of RMB 17.0 is based on a target P/B of 1.2x and 
2019E BVPS of RMB 14.2.  
We believe PAB should enjoy a valuation premium vs sector peers, given its greater 
business growth potential, higher retail banking exposure, wider technology utilization, 
and faster earnings growth.

Key Risks 
Risks related to macroeconomy  
China’s economic growth has been slowing down in recent years, and government is 
actively pushing for deleveraging and industrial upgrade. In addition, the China-US trade 
tension is adding pressure on the country’s economic outlook. Although we believe the 
slowdown remains largely controllable as countermeasures are rolled out, an unexpected 
macro hard-landing may cause the asset quality of banks to deteriorate. The weakened 
business activities and employment may dampen the repayment capability of both 
corporate and retail customers of the Bank, consequently leading to a surge in NPLs.  
Risks related to monetary policy  
China banks’ profitability is closely related to central bank’s monetary policies. PBoC has 
been liberalizing its interest rates, and this has significant impact on both asset and 
liability sides of banks. Banks with extensive customer reach and comprehensive product 
offering will have stronger bargaining power on lending rates. On the other hand, banks 
compete for funding with higher deposit rates, which could drive up their liability costs and 
squeeze margins. Looking ahead, we expect China to maintain a relatively 
accommodative policy environment to cushion the impact from escalating trade tension. 
Therefore, liquidity condition should stay relatively eased. This, to some extent, would 
help to mitigate the margin pressure for banks heavily relying on interbank borrowings. 
However, should the central bank tighten the monetary policy or loosen the guidance on 
deposit rate cap, banks’ deposit competition will further intensify and weigh on their NIM. 
Risks related to credit card and consumption loans  
Credit cards and consumption loans, with smaller amounts and better risk diversification, 
generate higher yields (vs mortgages) and lower NPL ratios (vs personal business loans). 
Therefore, they are preferred assets for banks to increase retail banking exposure, 
especially amid China’s consumption upgrade. However, individual customers may also 
borrow from the fast-expanding consumer finance providers and online lending platforms. 
As the credit records in these channels may not be available for banks to obtain, 
customers’ debt level may be underestimated, and their default risks may increase 
especially during economic downturn and rising unemployment rate. The soaring debt 
ratio of individuals and spill-over effect of defaults may result in higher NPLs of banks’ 
retail loans. 
Risks related to regulatory environment  
Chinese authorities have been tightening the regulation on banks’ business activities and 
operating indicators. For example, CBIRC is considering to implement a stricter NPL 
recognition standard. After banks had included >90 day overdue loans into NPLs by the 
end of 2018, the regulator was guiding large banks to further include >60 day overdue 
loans into NPLs. PAB improved its NPL / >90 day overdue loans ratio to 103% in 2018, 
from 52% in 2015. This partly resulted in relatively high NPL formation and credit costs 
during the period. If the stricter NPL recognition is imposed sector wide, PAB may face 
further pickup in NPL ratio and pressure on impairment charges.

Risks related to industry competition  
China banks are facing multiple challenges, including economic restructuring, regulatory 
intervention, and the rise of internet finance companies. These would result in 
deteriorating profitability for corporate banking business. As such, Retail business 
becomes the future battleground, and banks are all deploying vast amount of resources 
to increase their competitiveness, such as investments in financial technology and 
broadening of customer reach. PAB stays in the forefront of retail business development 
and Fintech utilization, in our view. However, other banks may catch up with innovative 
products. Financial services provided by technology giants, such as Alibaba and Tencent, 
could also divert the Bank’s customer resources.
