SUMMARY. LONGi is the world’s largest manufacturer of PV monocrystalline 
silicon wafer, cells and module. The Company received well recognition from A-
share market, and has the largest market capitalization among global peers. 
Based on close examination on market trend, product supplies and demand, we 
believe LONGi will further enhance its leading market position and become a 
solar giant in the solar farm grid-parity era.  
 Mono-Si demand is picking up with grid-parity trend. As non-module costs 
for PV farm development is more significant in recent years, downstream PV 
development calls for a suitable technology to offer higher. We believe mono-
Si cell is currently the best available technology to answer the call, with 
efficiency up to 26.7%. Market data from CPIA and ITRPV confirmed the trend 
favors mono-Si products, as mono-Si module had gained market share to 40-
45% in 2018.  
 Tight supply for high-efficiency mono wafer. We believe mono wafer 
supply will likely be tight in 2019-20E, as market demand focus shifts to PERC 
cells technology. We estimate mono-Si wafer demand to reach 
69GW/88GW/109GW in 2019-21E, with PERC capacity reaching 100GW. We 
expect PECR cells capacity will outpace mono-wafer supply, and that will lead 
to tight supply in 2019-20E. As such, we expect leading mono-Si wafer 
suppliers to maintain full production and sales in 2019-21E. 
 Second mover advantages and expanding at a good timing. We believe 
LONGi is a rising star comparing with industry peers. Supported by 1) 
declining upstream Poly-Si costs 2) stable product ASP outlook, 3) low costs 
CAPEX for future expansion, we expect LONGi to enjoy good returns from 
capacity growth with relatively stable ASP and GPM, and that will increase 
LONGi’s earnings visibility.  
 Initiate BUY with TP of RMB28.0. We expect LONGi to deliver EPS CAGR 
of 20.7% in 2019-21E, with EPS of RMB1.22/1.42/1.78 respectively. Given 
LONGi’s leading product costs structure and sound financial supports for 
future capacity expansion, we believe LONGi deserves a valuation premium 
over peers’ average of 17.9x FY19E PER. We adopt 23.0x FY19E for 
LONGi’S valuation with a TP of RMB28.0. Initiate coverage on LONGi with 
BUY recommendation.

Mono-Si demand is picking up with grid-parity trend  
PV non-module costs is becoming more significant in recent years  
The trend was established under the background of rapid costs reduction from market 
competition as well as series technological improvements. Multi-Si and mono-Si module 
prices had declined with a pace of 28.2% and 27.6% respectively per year from 2015 to 
2018. According NREL’s publication of US Solar PV System Costs in 1Q18, PV module 
costs accounted for less than 50% and less than 30% utility-scale and commercial 
distributed PV system in the US. The significant change urged PV industry to explore 
means to further reduce overall system costs, and the answer of the key is efficiency. PV 
development calls for a suitable technology to offer higher photovoltaic transmission rate 
while maintaining costs-efficiency. 
Figure 12: US Solar PV System Cost Benchmark 
 
Source: NREL 
Mono-Si cell is currently the best available technology to answer the 
call 
According to Fraunhofer ISE’s research, mono-Si cell and module offer the highest lab 
efficiency at 26.7% and 24.4% respectively, comparing with multi-Si, CIGS and CdTe thin 
film, and Perovskite technologies. For the past decade, market had put multi-Si module 
and mono-Si module as close pair for comparison. According to IHS Markit, mono-Si 
module had maintained 1-1.5ppt efficiency rate leading ahead of multi-Si module, while we 
observed mono-Si products had achieved faster cost reduction pace from technology 
breakthrough in the past five years, which kicked off a trend for high-efficiency mono-Si 
product to replace traditional multi-Si module.

Mono-Si has been gaining market shares from 2015 
As non-module costs become increasingly vital, the economic value of higher module 
efficiency is obvious. Higher PV module efficiency represents higher power concentration 
in a unit size of solar panel, and that helps solar farm investors save considerable costs 
from balance-of-system (BOS), land or rooftop acquisition and lands, labor installation 
costs, as well as some other overhead costs. According to our understanding, we believe 
the higher non-module costs for a solar farm, the higher possibility that project owner will 
select a mono-Si panel and more willing to pay for a premium for those extra power offered 
by the high-efficiency products. According to PSE GmbH, mono-Si module had reversed 
its shrinking trend since 2015, and exhibited significant market shares gaining thereafter. 
CPIA and ITRPV’s estimates also suggest mono-Si module had a market penetration rate 
of 40-45% in 2018, and mono-Si’s market share will expand further in 2019-21E to 53-55%.

Competition landscape 
Solar wafer sales is currently operating in an oligopoly market structure after years of 
market competition and consolidation. There are three key market players, namely LONGi, 
Zhonghuan Semiconductor (ZHS, 002129), and GCL Poly (3800 HK, HOLD), and several 
integrated solar module manufacturers such as Jinko (JKS US) and Canadian Solar (CSIQ 
US) with their own wafer supply. LONGi and ZHS are key participants dominating duopoly 
mono-Si wafer market, while GCL Poly focuses on multi-Si wafer manufacturing. We 
estimate LONGi, ZHS, GCL Poly will have effective wafer output of 31.6GW, 25GW and 
25GW respectively, and the other integrated module manufacturer will produce ~30GW 
wafer output to fulfill internal module orders. As we expect global PV installation demand 
will reach ~115GW in 2019, we believe solar wafer demand is largely fulfilled by those key 
wafer manufacturers and integrated module, leaving considerable oversupply from those 
traditional independent wafer manufacturers. 
Tight supply for high-efficiency mono wafer  
We are not particularly worried about the oversupply of solar wafer, however, as we believe 
mono wafer supply will likely be tight in 2019-20E, especially when we shift demand focus 
on PERC cells production capacity. PERC stands for Passivated Emitter and Rear Contact. 
It is currently the costs effective high-efficiency PV cell technology, and has been adopted 
in large scale since late 2017. According to our channel check, PERC production line 
requires CAPEX at ~RMB300mn per GW. Given considerable pricing premium for mono-
Si products over multi-Si products, we expect PERC cells manufacturers to have 
preference in selecting mono-wafer for their brand new PERC cells investment, and that 
will boost mono-Si wafer demand.  
In 2019-21E, we forecast global PV installation will reach 115/133/153GW, representing a 
demand CAGR of 13.7% from 2018-21E. Based on the assumption of ~10% pipeline PV 
module inventories as well as mono-Si wafer penetration rate of 55%/60%/65% in 2019-
21E, we estimate mono-Si wafer demand to reach 69GW/88GW/109GW in 2019-21E, 
respectively, representing a 2018-21E CAGR of 34.3%. In the PERC cells manufacturing 
end, however, PERC capacity had reached ~60GW by 2018, and market expects the figure 
will likely to reach above 100GW by end-2019, significantly higher than our mono-Si wafer 
demand projection. We expect PECR cells capacity outpace mono-Si output growth will 
also boost mono-Si wafer demand and lead to tight supply in 2019-20E, and undersupply

may be ease as upstream output is to be released in 2021E. Therefore, we expect leading

Investment highlights 
Costs leadership ensures superior profitability 
We believe LONGi’s continuous focus on costs leadership is a key leading to the 
Company’s superior profitability and long-term success. We summarize four key aspects 
of LONGi’s costs control measures, including:  
1) locating mono-Si rod production facilities in low electricity costs areas: LONGi 
was one of first movers to set up mono-Si rod and wafer production in Ningxia and 
Yunnan to utilize low electricity costs in those areas;  
2) forming strategic partnership with major production equipment suppliers to 
lower capacity expansion costs as well as unit product depreciation; 
3) continuous R&D investment brought successful technology breakthrough, which 
led diamond wire saw wafer cutting revolution in 2015, and laid a solid foundation for 
mono-Si products’ expansion; and  
4) making long-term capacity expansion plan to increase economic of scales: 
LONGi started formulating its rolling 3-year capacity expansion plan since 2018 and 
we expect LONGi’s ambitious capacity expansion target will help the Company 
enhance it costs leadership through economic of scales, as well as setting higher entry 
barriers for any new entrants to the industry.  
Backed by successful costs improvement measures, we observed two significant costs 
reduction phase from LONGi’s mono-Si wafer non-silicon costs movement. The first phase 
was in 2014-2016 when LONGi introduced DWS cutting for mono-Si wafer which 
substantially increased wafer production efficiency. We estimate non-silicon production 
costs were reduced by 38.9% from RMB3.15/piece in 2014 to RMB1.92/piece in 2016. We 
expect the second phase accelerating costs reduction is still ongoing from 2017 to 2021E, 
as LONGi announced to make aggressive capacity expansion. The economies of scale for 
capacity expansion has started to appear, as we estimate LONGi’s non-silicon wafer 
manufacturing cost in 2018 declined by 31.2% YoY to RMB1.16/piece, and we expect the 
non-silicon costs will continues to fall to RMB1.01/0.96/0.94 per piece wafer in 2019-21E 
respectively.  
Costs leadership had helped LONGi obtain superior profitability. According to peers 
benchmark with ZHS and GCL Poly, LONGi had significantly higher gross profit margin, 
even during demand shock caused by NEA’s “5.31” policy brake. Given rapid declining 
Poly-Si price in 2019, we expect LONGi’s mono-Si wafer gross profit margin to resume 
28.0% in 2019, and decline slightly in 2020-21E due to further wafer ASP decline.

LONGi’s mono-Si module business was developed through acquisition of Zhejiang Leye 
PV Science & Technology Co., Ltd in 2014. Different from mono-Si wafer’s costs leadership 
strategy, we believe LONGi’s module business development focuses on product 
photovoltaic transmission efficiency side. Given supports from low costs in-house 
manufactured wafer, LONGi Leye module exhibited rapid costs reduction in 2015-17, as 
we estimate non-wafer production costs declined by 36.9% from RMB1.76/watt in 2015 to 
RMB1.11/watt in 2017. We estimate non-wafer costs to have slight increase in 2018 as 
LONGi adopts more mono-Si PERC cells for high-efficiency modules. As market is in favor 
of high-efficiency solar modules with considerable pricing premium, however, we believe 
the slight increase in non-wafer costs was justified. LONGi’s mono-Si module sales also 
exhibited superior profitability, as the Company’s module sales recorded higher than peers’ 
gross profit margins during the past few years. Looking forward, we expect LONGi’s solar 
module gross profit margin to relatively be stable.

Second mover advantages and expanding at good timing 
LONGi is a rising star comparing with industry peers. Given rapid technical iteration 
characteristic of PV module development, we believe second mover will be in a better 
position to select more competitive technologies and invest with a substantially lower costs. 
LONGi’s CAPEX cycle started in 2015 and accelerated from 2017. As a second mover of 
the solar industry bring in revolutionary DWS wafer cutting technology, we believe LONGi 
has substantially less borrowings and historical investment burden, allowing the Company 
to seize a favorable position at time entering into solar farm grid-parity era. Moreover, 
rapidly developing PERC cells technology further expands market demand for LONGi’s 
mono-Si wafer, since mono-Si and PERC cell combo offer significant efficiency 
improvement, which we see vital to further reduce solar farm investment costs.  
In the upstream material end, Poly-Si is the most important raw material for LONGi’s mono-
Si rod and wafer production. LONGi’s Poly-Si sourcing used to rely on import with relatively 
high pricing fluctuation due to trade dispute. Thanks to domestic Poly-Si manufacturers’ 
aggressive expansion aiming at import substitution, Poly-Si price exhibited significant 
decline during the past two years, and LONGi also secured its Poly-Si supply through 
signing long-term procurement contracts with leading Poly-Si suppliers. As we expect there 
will be massive new Poly-Si capacity to release in 2019-20E, we believe Poly-Si price will 
likely to decline and stay low with reasonable GPM at 20-30%, representing pricing at a 
range of RMB70-80/kg for mono grade Poly-Si. As such, we expect LONGi will have stable 
upstream material costs structure in 2019-21E.

In the mono-Si product sales perspective, as we believe current solar farm development is 
getting very close to mass grid-parity in majority areas in the world, we expect solar module 
price will tend to stabilize. We do expect solar module ASP to decline further in the future, 
but we don’t expect product pricing to have significant shuffle as past few years. As such, 
we believe LONGi will be able to enjoy good returns from capacity growth with relatively 
stable ASP and GPM, and that will increase LONGi’s earnings visibility.

Sound financials and strong financing capability  
LONGi listed on Shanghai Stock Exchange in 2012. The Company received well market 
recognition in China through its technological focus on mono-Si products, excellent costs 
control, as well as prudent financial management. Management maintained low gearing as 
major financial management strategy, and mainly used equity financing as funding source 
to support LONGi’s massive CAPEX plan. As such, LONGi is able to maintain its low 
indebtedness level leading ahead of solar peers. Listing in the A-share market, LONGi is 
able to reach continuous equity financing as A-Stock investors are willing to pay for long-
term future. Therefore, standing at the gate of grid-parity era, we believe LONGi has 
stronger financing capability comparing with peers listed in Hong Kong and US capital 
market.

Financials 
We forecast revenue CAGR of 43.4% in 2019-21E 
LONGi’s sales growth was impressive in 2013-18 with a revenue CAGR of 57.3%. On the 
back of mono-Si wafer and module sales volume growth driven by strong market demand 
and capacity expansion, the Company recorded revenue growth of 64.6% in 1Q19. Given 
high solar module order visibility from overseas market, we expect LONGi’s strong sales 
growth trend to continue in 2Q and 3Q19. Based on NEA’s recent development rules for 
solar farm projects in 2019, we expect solar module demand in China to concentrate in 
2H19, and we expect that will likely support LONGi’s wafer and module sales as well as 
product ASP.  
We forecast LONGi’s revenue to increase by 35.6%/48.0%/38.9% YoY in 2019E-21E, 
respectively, mainly driven by 66.4% module sales CAGR and 11.1% wafer revenue CAGR 
during the period. We expect mono-module’s revenue contribution will increase as new 
capacity release output, and module sales mix will change from 59.5% in 2018 to 
51.7%/63.7%/69.7% in 2019E-21E. Mono-wafer’s revenue contribution will boost up in 
2019E due to faster capacity expansion pace than mono-module. We estimate mono-wafer 
sales revenue contribution mix to increase from 27.8% in 2018 to 38.7% in 2019E, then 
decline to 28.2%/23.2% in 2020-21E.

Resilient gross profit gross profit margin  
LONGi’s overall gross profit margin follow a similar track as the Company achieved 
technology breakthrough with DWS wafer cutting and gaining economies of scale through 
capacity expansion. Gross profit margin increased from 12.3% in 2013 to multi-year high 
at 32.3% in 2017, then suffered a sharp decline to 22.2% in 2018 due to Chinese 
Government’s “5.31” policy brake, which caused solar price to tumble in 2H18. Looking 
forward, based on 1) stable upstream Poly-Si price outlook, 2) wafer and module ASP 
decline in a mild pace, and 3) LONGi’s continuous costs reduction measures, we forecast 
LONGi’s mono-module gross profit margin to be resilient at 22.2%/21.2%/21.1% in 2019-
21E respectively, while mono-wafer gross profit margin to rebound to 28.0% in 2019E, then 
decline gradually to 26.0%/23.0% in 2020E/21E. We expect gross margin decline to be 
driven by ASP decline slightly faster than production cost reduction. We expect LONGi’s 
overall gross profit margin to also stay resilient at 24.9%/22.8%/21.5% in 2019-21E, 
respectively.

Expenses rate to stay stable at ~10% 
LONGi’s major operating expenses include 1) business taxes and surcharges, 2) selling 
expenses, 3) administrative expenses, 4) R&D expenses and 5) impairment losses. The 
Company’s operating expenses to revenue ratios were largely stable at ~10%, except 2016 
and 2018 when LONGi recognized substantially high inventory impairment loss due to 
product price tumble. Looking forward, as LONGi’s wafer and module sales is scaling up, 
we expect LONGi will have increasing inventory impairment exposures. However, as we 
expect solar product ASP will tend to be stable in the future together with management’s 
inventory management, we expect inventory impairment will be in good control. Overall, 
we forecast LONGi’s operating expenses rate to decline from 12.2% back to its normal 
level at 10.3% in 2019, and stay stable at ~10% in 2020/21E.

2019-21E net profit CARG to reach 25.5% 
LONGi’s net profit CAGR during 2013-2018 was outstanding among solar manufacturing 
peers at a stunning figure of 104.8%. Net profit surged from RMB70.9mn in 2013 to 
RMB2,558mn in 2018. LONGi reported 1Q19 net profit of RMB611mn with YoY earnings 
growth of 12.5%, slower than revenue growth as 1Q19 had a substantially different market 
pricing and gross profit margin structure comparing with 1Q18. However, given 1) stable 
material costs and product ASP outlook, 2) resilient gross profit margin projection, and 3) 
significant sales volume growth boost by capacity growth and thrilling increasing mono-Si 
market demand, we expect LONGi to maintain strong bottom line growth performance. We 
forecast net profit to reach RMB4,102/5,164/6,461mn in 2019-21E with earnings growth 
YoY of 60.4%/25.9%/25.1%, respectively. Our estimate suggests LONGi’s earnings CAGR 
in 2019-21E to reach 25.5%.  
From EPS growth perspective, though LONGi had significant equity financing during past 
few years, the Company still delivered an EPS CAGR of 48.2% in 2013-18. The Company 
just raised RMB3.9bn through rights issues in Apr 2019. We estimate LONGi will have a 
2019-21E EPS CAGR of 20.7%.

Healthy balance sheet supports future capacity expansion  
LONGi has prudent financial management on balance sheet. The Company has 
maintained net cash position for years, and turned net gearing to 0.2% in 2018 as with 
massive capacity investments. Management adopts 60% liabilities to assets ratio as the 
major controlling measures for indebtedness level, and LONGi adopts equity financing 
through rights issue and placement as major funding source for CAPEX. Given LONGi’s 
low borrowing level, we believe the Company also has plenty room to gear up through debt 
financing to support future CAPEX needs, and that may help LONGi to balance the 
concerns for EPS dilution and gearing control.  
LONGi exhibited an inventory turnover days jump from 59.2 days in 2017 to 71.1 in 2018, 
receivable and payable turnover days also experienced a hike in 2018 as the Company 
expanded its capacity and sales. Management explained inventory building in 2018 was 
mainly due to changing geographic sales structure, since LONGi shifted module sales 
focus from domestic market to overseas, and it took longer time for overseas sales with 
longer shipping and warehouse storage cycle. We believe LONGi is still in its learning 
phase for overseas inventory management, and we project inventory turnover days to 
increase further to 78.6 days in 2019E, and then improve to 71.3 and 72.0 days in 2020/21E, 
respectively.

Valuation  
Current valuation and historical valuation range   
LONGi is trading at FY19E PER of 18.3x, based on our FY19E EPS estimate of RMB1.22 
per share. LONGi’s valuation is in line with sector average of 18.2x FY19E PER.  
Historically, LONGi traded with a 1-year forward PER range between 7.6x and 68.4x during 
the pasted five years, with a 5-year average PER of 17.4x. LONGi’s valuation was traded 
up to +1 standard deviation to 24.8x during Jul 2017 to May 2018 as the Company gained 
significant cost advantages and expanding mono-Si market shares. Valuation tumbled after 
NEA’s “5.31” policy brake in Jun 2018, then resumed quickly as market perceived LONGi’s 
resilient earnings performance. 
Initiate BUY with TP of RMB28.0 per share 
We initiate with BUY rating on LONGi with a TP of RMB28.0 per share, based on 23x 
2019E PER. Our target multiple is derived based LONGi’s historical up cycle as well as 
28.5% valuation premium over sector peers average valuation. On the back of solar farm 
demand to resume and concentrate in 2H19, we expect mono-Si demand and ASP to be 
solid, and that will likely intensify market sentiment towards the solar manufacturing sector. 
Moreover, given LONGi’s leading product costs structure as well as capability to expand 
capacity output to meet grid-parity demand with sound financing supports, we expect 
LONGi to further enhance its leading position ahead of peers. As such, we believe LONGi 
deserves a valuation premium, and our valuation target is justified.

Major risk factors 
Substitutional PV technology breakthrough 
LONGi placed PV technology focus on mono-silicon, and made heavy investments in 
mono-PERC technology combo across its key product lines from monocrystalline-rod, 
wafer, cells and all the way towards high efficient mono-modules. The Company had 
established technology leadership through high efficient mono-PV cell over traditional 
multicrystalline products. As technology would never stop evolving, however, we believe 
LONGi will face risks from substitutional technologies, such as 1) cast-mono wafer, 2) 
larger size wafer without chamfer, 3) PV cell focus shift from PERC technology to HIT PV 
Cell technologies, and 4) perovskite solar cell. Any technology breakthrough through those 
technologies will significantly increase substitutional risks to LONGi’s mono-wafer and 
module products.  
Policy risks in China and overseas markets  
We still see policy uncertainty a key market risk in China for LONGi, albeit market demand 
in the country was eventually released from a freeze due to “5.31” policy brake. We’ve 
noticed that NEA took unusually long time to finalize PV project development rules in China 
for 2019, indicating difficulties to balance needs from different stakeholders. Going forward, 
as PV power has now becoming a more significant energy source, we expect NDRC and 
NEA China to establish a more sophisticated system to promote and govern renewable 
energy applications. We believe the processes will be bumpy, and that will likely bring 
uncertainties to LONGi’s business in near term. 
LONGi has increasing business exposures in the overseas market as the Company 
expands its mono-product capacity and shipments. We believe LONGi has mature 
experience in handling trade dispute such as setting overseas production facilities in 
Malaysia to avoid additional tariff. However, given LONGi’s increasing overseas sales 
exposure with major production facilities in China, we believe LONGi could still suffer from 
potential trade dispute in short term.  
Exchange rate risk 
LONGi turned product sales focus to overseas market after “5.31” policy brake. According 
to management, overseas market sales accounted for more than 70% of total revenue in 
4M19, and overseas sales were mainly settled with US$. RMB appreciation would be 
unfavorable to LONGi’s profit margin as major production costs are settled in RMB.
