SUMMARY. LONGi released positive profit alert, stating 1H19 earnings would 
surge by 50-60% YoY on the back of 1) rapid wafer and module sales growth and 
2) improving product costs. We believe 1H19 earnings beat consensus estimates, 
and 2H19 module sales will likely accelerate with PV demand release in China.  
 2Q19 earnings more than doubled QoQ. LONGi's profit alert stated that 
1H19 earnings surged 50-60% YoY to RMB1,961mn-2,091mn, implying 2Q19 
earnings would be RMB1,350mn-1,480mn, more than double of 1Q19 
earnings of RMB611mn. We believe the yet to release 1H19 results will beat 
consensus estimates, as 1) 1H19 earnings would account for ~half of 
consensus earnings of RMB4,077mn, while we see 2H19 module shipment to 
accelerate with HoH growth of 49.7%; and 2) GPM from wafer and module 
sales seems better than our estimates.  
 Strong 1H19 shipment; 2H19 module sales likely to aim higher. Wafer 
and module shipment recorded 2,151mn piece and 3.2GW, representing YoY 
growth of 183.8% and 21.4% respectively. LONGi's wafer and module 
shipment hit 51.5% and 40.1% run rate versus our FY19 estimates (4,177mn 
piece wafer, and 8.0GW module sales). We are still optimistic about LONGi's 
mono-product sales in 2H19 as 1) mgmt. disclosed LONGi has already 
secured 70% module orders for 3Q19, and 2) we expect more than 25GW PV 
installation demand in China to release in 2H19 with NEA's recent project 
bidding results. We believe LONGi's sales target will be easily fulfilled.  
 Secure long-term wafer sales contract. Prior to the positive profit alert, 
LONGi announced to reach long-term wafer sales contract for 1,310mn pieces 
in 2019-21 with Ningbo Yize (宁波江北宜则新能源) . Based on current wafer 
spot market price, the contract worth US$540mn, and we estimate the 
contract wafer shipment represents ~6%/10%/9% of LONGi's wafer external 
sales volume in 2019-21E.  
 Raise FY19E earnings up by 5.9%. Based on revised GPM outlook for 
LONGi's better-than-expected wafer and module production costs control, we 
raise FY19-21E EPS outlook by 5.9%/7.3%/11.8% to RMB1.30/1.53/1.99 
respectively. We believe LONGi's 1H19 performance will enhance its leading 
position in PV product supply chain. Reiterate BUY with TP unchanged at 
RMB28.00 per share.
