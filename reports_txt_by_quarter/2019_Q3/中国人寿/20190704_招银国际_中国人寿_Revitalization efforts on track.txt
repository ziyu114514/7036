SUMMARY. During our visit last week, China Life impressed us with detailed 
measures and recent achievements of its revitalization plan regarding two major 
tasks this year - sales force development and investment yield improvement. 
Premium growth has been largely in line and NBV growth outlook is positive. We are 
optimistic about business recovery of the Company and initiate it’s A-share with BUY 
rating. Target price is RMB33.10. 
 
Positive NBV and margin outlook. 1) Although GWP growth lost steam in Mar 
(-6.3% YoY) and Apr (-30.8% YoY) primarily due to last year’s high base and 
decline of renewal premiums, FYP restored double-digit growth in May, 
according to the Company. 2) NBV margin improvement is likely to continue 
thanks to higher share of longer-duration and protection-type products. The 
Company recorded stellar NBV growth of 28.3% in 1Q19. We forecast NBV to 
increase 14.1% during the whole year.   
 
Agent reform- to integrate bancassurance sales force in 2H19. China Life 
was the only lifer among major peers that achieved agent headcount growth in 
1Q19. Exclusive individual agents reached 1.537 million and total sales force 
1.89 million at the end of 1Q19, compared to 1.44 million/1.78 million at YE2018. 
In 2H19, the Company plans to consolidate its bancassurance sales force, 
among which ~90% are selling similar products as exclusive individual agents. 
China Life will also continue to promote differentiated sales to match customer 
needs, strengthen footing in higher-tier cities while maintaining leading position 
in lower-tier ones and optimize incentive packages for agents.  
 
Beef up equity investment performance. The Company is determined to 
address weak spots in equity investment, which used to cause large swings in 
net profit. Measures include 1) implementing market-based employment and 
valuation system, 2) strictly monitoring third-party entrustment, 3) increasing the 
percentage of long-term equity investment.  
 
Initiate BUY with TP at RMB33.10. Given clear roadmap and solid steps of the 
Company’s reform plan, we suggest investors to accumulate and bet on business 
improvement. We initiate A-share of the Company based on H-share TP plus 50% 
premium (close to 1-year historical avg. A/H premium). The A-share stock is 
currently trading at 0.93x FY19E P/EV (vs. peers’ average of 0.90x). Our TP 
corresponds to 1.06x/0.97x FY19/20E P/EV.
