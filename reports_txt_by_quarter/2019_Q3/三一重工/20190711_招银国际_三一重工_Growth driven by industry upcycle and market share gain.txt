SUMMARY. We believe SANY’s growth is on a good track with a couple of 
positive drivers: (1) the rebound of excavator sales in Jun is a positive sign; (2) 
SANY’s strong execution to continue to drive further market share gain; (3) strong 
growth of crane and concrete machinery sales to sustain. Stock is trading at 11x 
2019E consensus earnings, which we think is not excessive as we expect the 
upcycle to continue, driven by strict environmental policies and replacement 
demand.   
 Sales of excavator rebounded in Jun. According to CCMA, sales volume of 
excavator (25 major producers in China) grew 6.6% YoY to 15k in Jun, 
following a 2.2% decline in May. Sales in China was down only 0.3% YoY in 
Jun, much better than the 5.8% decline in May. Export remained robust in Jun 
with sales volume surging 56% YoY, the highest YTD in terms of both growth 
rate and absolute figure. In 1H19, sales of excavator grew 14.2% YoY. We 
believe the run rate is still on track to reach our full year estimate of 15% 
growth.   
 SANY’s market share gain likely to continue. Chinese excavator makers 
have been gaining market share for years. On the back of rapid improvement 
in product quality, precise marketing strategy and excellent management 
execution, SANY has become a clear winner with market share increased 
substantially from ~12% in 2011 to ~26% in 5M19, significantly outpacing all 
the major competitors (figure 3 & 4). Driven by both industry growth and 
market share gain, SANY targets to achieve sales volume of >20% YoY in 
2019E. 
 Explosive growth of crane and concrete machinery. We understand that 
SANY’s crane machinery sales growth reached 100% YoY in 1H19E, 
significantly higher than the industry average of 50-60%. For concrete 
machinery, SANY’s concrete pump truck sales volume growth reached 100% 
YoY in 1H19E. SANY is particularly bullish on this segment as the entire 
demand is driven by replacement at present. We expect SANY to continue to 
deliver much higher growth than the industry average going forward.
