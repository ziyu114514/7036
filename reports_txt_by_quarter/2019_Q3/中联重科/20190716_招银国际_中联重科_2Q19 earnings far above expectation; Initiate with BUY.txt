SUMMARY. The positive alert issued by Zoomlion last Friday implied 1.9x-2.5x 
YoY increase in net profit in 2Q19. This is far above expectations as the net 
profit range of RMB2.4-2.7bn in 1H19 already accounted for 72-82% of the full 
year consensus forecast. We forecast Zoomlion to deliver 95%/14% earnings 
growth in 2019E and 20E. Initiate with BUY and TP of RMB$6.70, based on 
1.3x 2019E target P/B.  
 Explosive earnings growth in 2Q19. Zoomlion announced that its 
preliminary net profit in 1H19 is expected to surge 1.72x-2.12x to RMB2.4-
2.7bn (based on PRC GAAP). The impressive growth was driven by (1) 
property and infrastructure construction that boosted the concrete and crane 
equipment; (2) the strong demand for Zoomlion’s core products such as 
pump truck, tower crane and construction crane; (3) reduction of expense 
ratios. In 2Q19, the implied net profit range is RMB1.4-1.7bn, representing 
1.9x-2.5x YoY growth and 39-69% QoQ growth.   
 Staying positive on both crane and concrete machinery. According to 
CCMA data, sales volume of truck crane (9 major players in China) surged 
63% YoY in 5M19 and we believe Zoomlion delivered higher-than-average 
growth. We believe the potential improvement in infrastructure spending and 
NES upgrade should continue to boost demand for truck crane going 
forward. On the other hand, demand for tower crane and concrete 
machinery are more driven by property construction that has been improving 
since early this year. In particular, for tower crane, we expect Zoomlion to 
gain market share from the smaller players.  
 Earnings growth of 95%/14%/4% in 2019E-21E. Our revenue growth 
forecast for 2019E/20E/21E are 46%/10%/7%. We expect gross margin to 
continue to expand in 2019E-20E. Besides, we assume significant operating 
leverage effect to boost the earnings growth.    
 Initiate with BUY. Our TP of RMB6.70 is based on 1.3x 2019E target P/B, 
on the back of 10-12% ROE in 2019E-21E. We benchmark Zoomlion-A’s 
valuation in 2013 when the ROE was ~12%. Upcoming catalysts include: (1) 
earnings raised by the market in the near term; (2) continuously strong 
monthly industry sales data points.
