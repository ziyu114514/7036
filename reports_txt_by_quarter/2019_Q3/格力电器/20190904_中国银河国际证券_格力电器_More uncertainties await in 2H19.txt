Gree 
More uncertainties await in 2H19 
■ Gree’s 1H19 results were slightly above consensus and our estimates, thanks to 
investment income and smaller write-offs than 1H18.  
■ Selling expense and ASP cuts continue to pressure margins and earnings in 2H19. 
■ The cash balance increased due to increase in payables. 
■ Gree’s ownership transfer progress remains unclear. The deadline for public 
solicitation is 2 Sep. 
■ We upgrade Gree to HOLD and revised our PER multiple from 9.5x to 12x to better 
reflect Gree’s valuation discount to Midea’s 14x. 
1H19 results slightly above expectation  
Gree’s 1H19 results were slightly above consensus and our estimates. Net profits grew 
7.2% YoY in 1H19 to Rmb13.8b, with the net profit margin staying flat at 14.0%. EPS 
grew 7.4% YoY in 1H19. Most of the profit growth came from investment income and 
smaller write-offs than a year ago. Gree’s revenue growth slowed to 7% YoY in 1H1. 
Midea had cut its AC ASP by over 6% through sales promotion in end of Q1. This 
increased competitive price pressure on Gree; the company’s selling expenses jumped 
3.8ppt YoY to 10.9% of sales in Q2. 
Selling expense and ASP cuts to pressure margins and earnings 
As China AC sales continued to slump in July, we expect Gree to only achieve mid-
single-digit full year top line growth and lower single-digit bottom line growth in the current 
situation, with high channel inventory and a slow property market. We expect Gree to 
maintain current level of selling expense in 2H19. We think ASP cuts may be commonly 
adopted by major AC makers to chase market share in lower end models in 2H19. As a 
result, ASP cuts and increased selling expense should put Gree’s margins and earnings 
growth under pressure in 2019. 
Cash balance increased, but this is due to increase in payables 
In 1H19, Gree’s increased its cash level by Rmb8bn YoY to Rmb121bn since 2018. The 
increase in cash was financed mainly by a substantial ~60% increase (~Rmb30b) in 
accounts payable. Recently, Gree has stepped up its business diversification efforts. It 
recently formed a strategic partnership with NEV maker WM Motor, signaling another 
attempted foray into the NEV industry after its failure of acquiring Zhuhai Yinlong. Gree is 
also in the process of acquiring 11% of handset maker Wingtech. We expect the growth 
in capex and investment to continue in 2H19. However, these diversifications are unlikely 
to have a significant impact on earnings in the near-term. 
Gree’s ownership transfer remains unclear 
This April, Gree’s parent Gree Group started to solicit offers to sell 15% stakes in Gree 
(~Rmb40bn), The deadline for the public solicitation is 2 Sep. A committee will be formed 
by the Gree Group to review the acquisition proposals submitted. We believe this will 
have an impact on the management of the company going forward. 
Upgrade to HOLD 
We don’t believe the small earnings beat by Gree in 1H19 will remove the overhang on 
the stock – the industry outlook, the impact of the consumer stimulus in 2020, Gree’s 
diversification efforts, and the result of the share tender. We upgrade Gree to HOLD, and 
value the company at 12x 2019 EPS. We revised our PE multiple from 9.5x to 12x to 
better reflect Gree’s valuation discount to Midea’s 14x.
