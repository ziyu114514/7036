CRRC-A 
Positive earnings growth delivered in 1H19  
■ CRRC released its 1H19 results and hosted a results conference call after market 
close on 29 August 2019.    
■ The 1H19 results were largely in line with our and consensus earnings estimates. 
Total revenue in 1H19 rose 11.4% YoY, while net profit in grew 16.2% YoY. The growth 
was driven mainly by its core railway and urban transit vehicle segments.  
■ We remain positive on its core business growth outlook in 2H19. We maintain our 
earnings forecast for the Company in 2019–2020. We cut our target price (TP) only 
from Rmb12.20 to Rmb11.00. Our TP is based on our CRRC-H share valuation and 
the historical A/H premium (discount). We think the current CRRC-A valuation is 
unjustified by its double-digit earnings growth potential. We reiterate our ADD rating 
on the stock.  
Solid 1H19 results   
Total revenue rose 11.4% YoY in 1H19, with growth seen mainly in its core railway and 
urban transit vehicle segments (Fig 1). Its core railway business (56% of total revenue in 
1H19) had revenue growth of 20.3% YoY vs. 11.5% YoY growth in 2018. This was led 
mainly led by the locomotive, passenger carriage and MU segments. Its urban transit 
vehicle business growth also accelerated 37.7% YoY in 1H19 vs. 3.6% YoY growth in 
2018. The new business segment reported revenue that was largely flat YoY in 1H19, 
with growth in its new energy equipment segment offsetting a revenue decline in its new 
materials and auto parts business. CRRC further scaled down its lower-margin modern 
service business in 1H19. The gross profit margin contracted by 0.8ppt YoY to 22.5% in 
1H19 due to changes in the revenue mix. But SG&A costs as a percentage of sales fell 
from 15.5% in 1H18 to 14.7% in 1H19 due to effective cost control. With the decrease in 
financing costs, its net profit margin expanded by 0.1ppt YoY and its net profit grew 
16.2% YoY in 1H19.  
Core business growth outlook intact  
We remain positive on the railway equipment demand growth outlook in 2H19. Railway 
FAI will remain a key measure to help the central government ensure steady economic 
growth. At the results meeting, management suggested that railway FAI in 2019F will 
reach more than Rmb800bn, with railway equipment investment reaching no less than 
Rmb100bn, implying >10% YoY growth. China Railway Corporation (CRC) gave priority 
to its corporate restructuring and business reforms in 1H19; hence, it has barely made 
any tenders on MUs CYTD. But management expects CRC to win new tenders on MUs, 
freight wagons, etc. in 2H19. We expect its revenue growth in 2H19 to be driven by its 
MU, passenger carriage, freight wagon and urban transit vehicle segments. We expect its 
revenue to grow 12.8% and 14.0% YoY in 2019F and 2020F, respectively.   
Margin expansion to continue in 2H19 
The gross profit margin contraction in 1H19 was mainly due to changes in the revenue 
mix. We expect its gross profit margin to remain stable in 2019–2020, given an improving 
revenue mix. We expect its SG&A costs as a percentage of sales to further fall in 2019–
2020, led by cost control from its continuous business streamlining. Considering its 
margin expansion potential, we expect net profit to grow about 20% p.a. in 2019–2020F.  
High earnings growth visibility to drive valuation recovery 
We reiterate our ADD rating for CRRC-A. We slightly cut our TP from Rmb12.20 to 
Rmb11.00. Our TP is based on our CRRC-H share valuation and the historical A/H 
premium (discount). We think the market was previously too bearish on CRRC’s earnings 
growth outlook. The current valuation is unjustified by its double-digit earnings growth 
potential in 2019. We expect its share price to react positively to the solid 1H19 results.
