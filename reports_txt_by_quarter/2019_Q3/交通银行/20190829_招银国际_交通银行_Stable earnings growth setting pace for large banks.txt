On 27 Aug, BoCom reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 42.7bn, up 4.9% YoY and 
accounting for 55.3%/57.3% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. In 2Q19, 
PPoP rose moderately by 4.3% YoY (vs 15.7% YoY in 1Q19), as growth in both 
net interest income and net fee income softened. The high base effect also led 
to a YoY decline in trading gains. However, bottom-line earnings growth was 
largely stable at 4.8% YoY (vs 4.9% YoY in 1Q19), thanks to tax savings from 
rising investment in tax-free government bond. 1H19 annualized ROE slid 
0.2ppt YoY to 12.8%.  
 Results positives: 1) Healthy loan growth of 5.7% HoH outpaced total 
asset growth of 3.7% HoH. 1H19 new loans was mainly from corporate 
segment (+8.0% HoH), as retail loans (+1.1% HoH) were held back by falling 
credit card overdrafts (-10.0% HoH). Outstanding discounted bills surged 
41.7% HoH, suggesting the Bank’s falling risk appetite. 2) Deposit growth 
picked up to 5.9% in 1H19 (vs 4.7% in 1H18), sending LDR down slightly to 
83.6%. That said, proportion of demand deposit declined 0.7ppt to 41.3%. 3) 
Asset quality remained solid, as NPL ratio was stable at 1.47%, and 
provision also held steady at 173.5%. NPL recognition was prudent, 
with >90-day overdue loan/NPL at 116%.     
 Results negatives: 1) 2Q19 NIM contracted 3bp QoQ to 1.56%, by our 
estimate. Despite lower interbank funding cost (-15bps HoH), deposit cost 
climbed 10bp HoH due to heightened deposit competition. With relatively 
large proportion of interbank liability, BoCom would gain more from 
monetary easing, but marginal benefit should diminish going forward; 2) 
Retail loan exposure declined 1.5ppt to 32.2%. BoCom’s below-peers 
retail loan proportion could make it more vulnerable to interest rate 
liberalization, although the Bank said during results briefing that the pricing 
of 70% new loans YTD was already based on LPR. 3) 1H19 CIR was 1.4ppt 
higher at 36.2%, as opex rose 16.8% YoY. Management explained 
investment in technology development accounted for over 5% of total opex, 
and will increase to 10% in coming years.   
 Initiate BoCom-A with HOLD rating and RMB 6.2 TP. BoCom-A currently 
trades at 0.59x FY19E P/B, 12% below its past 5-year mean of 0.67x. Our 
TP of RMB 6.2 is based on GGM-derived target P/B of 0.67x and FY19E 
BPS of RMB 9.3.
