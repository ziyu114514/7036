On 30 Aug, BOC reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 114bn, up 4.5% YoY and 
accounting for 60.4%/62.9% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. 1H19 
PPoP had a decent growth of 8.1% YoY, driven by strong trading/investment 
gains and better cost efficiency, despite a softer net interest income growth. In 
2Q19, the Bank set aside less provisions, offsetting a YoY surge in tax 
expenses. Therefore, bottom-line earnings growth accelerated to 5.0% YoY in 
2Q19 (vs 4.0% YoY in 1Q19). We initiate coverage on BOC A-share with 
BUY rating. 
 Results positive: 1) 2Q19 NIM edged up 2bp QoQ to 1.84%, vs a 
downward margin trend for other large banks. This was attributed to 
optimized asset mix and strict control in liability cost, according to 
management’s explanation during results briefing; 2) Demand deposit rose 
7.2% HoH, faster than total deposit growth of 5.5% HoH. In particular, retail 
demand deposits expanded 11.5% HoH. The proportion of total demand 
deposit climbed 0.8ppt HoH to 49.5%; 3) Asset quality improved notably, 
as NPL slid 2bp QoQ to 1.40%, lowest among the Big-5 banks. Both special 
mention and overdue loans saw double-decline in 2Q19. NPL recognition 
was more stringent, as NPLs covered 135.9% of >90-day overdue loans and 
98.5% of total overdue loans (vs 123.5% and 75.9% in 4Q18); 4) CAR was 
supported by multi-channel capital replenishment. BOC issued RMB 
40bn perpetual bonds and RMB 73b preference share in 1H19, boosting 
total CAR by 36bp HoH to 15.3%.      
 Results negative: 1) Provision coverage dropped 7.1ppt to 177.5%, 
lower than Big-5 average of 208%, indicating less buffer to hold up earnings 
should topline growth weakens. 2) Net fee income growth slowed to 3.6% 
YoY in 2Q19, dragged by falling fees on credit commitment and foreign 
exchange businesses. 3) 1H19 annualized ROE declined 0.7ppt to 14.6%, 
as net profit growth remained subdued at 4.5% YoY.   
 Initiate BOC-A with BUY rating and RMB 4.7 TP. BOC-A currently trades 
at 0.63x FY19E P/B, 11% below its past 5-year mean of 0.71x. Our TP of 
RMB 4.7 is based on GGM-derived target P/B of 0.84x and FY19E BPS of 
RMB 5.6.
