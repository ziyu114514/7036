SUMMARY. Being the fifth largest property developer in China, Poly Development 
takes the advantage of being central SOE. Currently, the Company has land bank of 
230mn sq m in more than 100 cities in China. We estimate net profit to be RMB24.7bn 
in 2019. Our target price is RMB16.64, representing 8.0x 2019E P/E. We initiate Poly 
Development with BUY recommendation. 
 
Over RMB400bn contracted sales in 2018. Contracted sales increased by 30.9% 
to RMB404.8bn in 2018. In 2019, China property market is facing many 
uncertainties. But the Company experienced a 21.8% contracted sales growth to 
RMB189bn in 5M19. Given RMB650bn saleable resources, we expect Poly 
Development 2019 full year contracted sales to be RMB480bn, up 18.6% YoY.  
 
230mn sq m land bank in more than 100 cities. Poly Development owns a 
230mn sq m land bank as at Mar 2019. Headquartered in Guangzhou, more than 
one-third of GFA under development is located at the PRD. The Company 
penetrates more than 100 cities in China. Its major products are targeted to first 
time home buyers or first time upgraders who have great demand for housing in 
China. 
 
High efficiency management team. Due to the military culture, the Company 
was built into a highly efficient management structure. It has a high execution 
power through clear defined responsibility, scientific decision-making mechanism, 
fair job duty appraisal, precise internal audit and organization monitoring. 
Meanwhile, it implements an attractive incentive scheme to retain talent.  
 
Forecast net profit to grow at a 23.1% CAGR from 2018 to 2021. Thanks for 
the increasing recognized GFA and recognized ASP, we forecast total revenue to 
grow from RMB194.6bn in 2018 to RMB364.9bn in 2021. Gross margin is 
expected to stay around 31.8-32.3% next three years. Therefore, we project net 
profit to be RMB24.7bn, RMB30.9bn and RMB35.4bn in 2019-21, respectively. 
 
Healthy balance sheet and central SOE advantage. Net gearing ratio was 80.6% 
by FY18. The Company has slowed down its land acquisition plan because of the 
cautious view on land market. Thus, we forecast net gearing ratio to trend down 
to 71.9% by FY19. The Company has already accumulated ample land bank that 
is sufficient to its next 3-4 years development. Furthermore, cost of debt was 5.03% 
in 2018 because of the central SOE status.

Robust sales growth  
Poly Development experienced a steady contracted sales growth from RMB125.3bn in 
2013 to RMB404.8bn in 2018, representing a 26.4% CAGR in the corresponding period. In 
2018, contracted sales increased by 30.9% to RMB404.8bn, ranking fifth nationally and 
first among SOE. In 2019, China property market is facing many uncertainties. But Poly 
Development experienced a 21.8% of contracted sales growth to RMB189.0bn in 5M19. 
Given RMB650bn saleable resources in 2019, we expect its 2019 full year contracted sales 
to be RMB480bn, up 18.6% YoY, or representing a 73.8% sales through rate.

Business diversification  
Revenue from property sales amounted to RMB182.5bn in 2018, representing 93.8% of 
total revenue. The Company will leverage its brand name and marketing position to 
penetrate general property service business and real estate fund. 
In Jun 2019, the Company announced its plan of spinning off property management 
business and listing on Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Poly Property Management is 
serving properties projects in 131 mainland cities. According to the information from NEEQ, 
revenue and net profit of Poly Property Management increased by 30.3% to RMB1,853mn 
and 64.4% to RMB185mn in 1H18. Since the delisting in Mar 2019, we estimate its 2018 
full year revenue and net profit to be RMB4bn and RMB400mn, respectively.  
AUM of Poly Real Estate Fund was RMB100bn. It had invested in more than 150 properties 
projects. Real Estate Fund not only improves the balance sheet, but also enhances return

Competitive advantage 
High efficiency management team 
Referring to the military culture, Poly Development was built into a highly efficient 
management structure. The Company has a high execution power through the clear 
defined responsibility, scientific decision-making mechanism, fair job duty appraisal, 
precise internal audit and organization monitoring. Furthermore, Poly Development 
implements an attractive incentive scheme with share option and project investment plans 
in order to stimulate staff performance. In addition, the Company pays attention to human 
resource training to secure a professional and sustainable management team. 
Niche strategic position  
Founded in 1992, Poly Development surged with the sustainable economic growth and 
urbanization. It receives ample harvest and enjoys steady growth by focusing business 
development in property market. In the past, contribution from property development 
always accounted for more than 90%. Now, the Company further expands business to 
general property service and real estate fund. On the one hand, there is synergy as these 
new business lines are related to property development business. On the other hand, it can 
cultivate new earnings growth drivers. 
Focus on major city clusters  
Poly Development focuses on the property market in the first and second tier cities as well 
as major city clusters, such as those in Pearl River Delta (PRD), Yangtze River Delta, 
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Central China, Western China and West Strait Region. For 
optimization, Poly Development would strengthen the business development in the robust 
cities. For example, about 60% of GFA under development is located in the first and second 
tier cities. Another 30% is situated in the third and fourth tier cities where are adjacent to 
the major city clusters. Especially, more than one-third of GFA under development is 
located at the PRD. In terms of product design, more than 85% of properties for sales are 
residential units, or majority of residential units are having average GFA of less than 144 
sq m that satisfied the demand for first time home buyers or first time upgraders. 
Integrated development of property related business  
After many years of development, Poly Development established multi channels for land 
acquisitions, including tendering, auction, listing, M&A, co-operation, urban renewal 
development etc.  It had accomplished many urban renewal development projects, theme 
parks, landmark buildings, signature towns and industrial parks. All of these projects 
enjoyed cost advantages. 
Thanks to the strong base in property development business, Poly Development is 
participating in upper and lower streams of property industry. For example, the Company 
is engaged in the general property servicing and real estate financing industries. It has 
strategic development in property management, agent, construction and real estate funds.

Low funding cost

multi financing channels, such as bank borrowing, equity financing, direct debt financing, 
asset back securities, etc. As at end of 2018, net gearing ratio was 80.6%. At the same 
period of time, cash on hand and short term borrowing were RMB113.4bn and RMB48.8bn, 
respectively. It is sufficient to fulfill any short-term financial obligation. Lastly, average 
annual funding cost was 5.03% in 2018, which was lower than other major competitors.

Financial analysis 
Revenue to grow at 23.3% CAGR from 2018 to 2021 
Sales of property accounted for 95%/94%/94% of total revenue in FY16/17/18. The rest of 
the revenue includes property related business (construction, decoration, property 
management, sales agency, exhibition, hotel etc.) and interest income from financial 
business. Driven by property development business, or in specific, increased GFA 
recognized and recognized ASP, total revenue grew at 15.6% CAGR from 2014 to 2018.

Figure 13: Revenue breakdown by segments

Geographically, Poly Development operates its business in 7 regions, including Southern 
China, Eastern China, Central China, Western China, Northern China, Northeast China 
and overseas regions. Southern China and Eastern China are the two most important 
targeted markets, together accounting for 65% of total revenue in FY18.  
Revenue recorded a 5.4% decline in FY17. This was mainly due to 40% decline of revenue 
from Northern China in FY17. However, revenue from Central China increased 60% during 
the period, which largely compensated the decline of Northern China. But ASP in Central 
China was lower than that in Southern China. Thus, although overall recognized GFA still 
grew in FY17 because of increased GFA recognized from Central China, overall 
recognized ASP still dropped from RMB11,652/sq m in FY16 to RMB9,948/sq m in FY17.

In FY18, contribution from Southern China and Eastern China increased 5ppt to 65% and 
revenue from Northern regained a 43% growth, so recognized ASP rapidly recovered to 
RMB12,016/ sq m in FY18. 
Looking forward, we expect recognized ASP will be sustainable and follow its growth track 
of its leading indicator, contracted ASP. Furthermore, the Company has disclosed its 
planned GFA completion in FY19, which increases to 27.50 mn sq m, 24% increase from 
22.17mn sq m actual completion in FY18.

Ratio of prepayment/recognized is a good revenue indicator. Normally, large ratio indicates 
more revenue has been locked. For Poly Development, the ratio jumped from 1.06 in FY16 
to 1.64 in FY17 and stayed flat in FY18, which indicates strong revenue visibility in the near 
term. The Company completed more than 33% its original new start GFA plan to 43.96mn 
sq m in FY18 and plans to new start 45.00mn sq m in FY19. We believe these new starts 
will provide ample saleable resources for FY19/20 and support the growth of revenue.

Accordingly, 
we 
forecast 
recognized 
GFA 
and 
recognized 
ASP 
to 
be 
19.25mn/23.10mn/25.41mn sq m and RMB12,377/12,996/13,646 per sq m in 
FY19E/20E/21E. We also forecast other revenue to grow at around 15% annually. Thus, 
total revenue is expected to be RMB 252.0bn/316.0bn/364.9bn in FY19E/20E/21E, 
representing a 23.3% CAGR from 2018 to 2021.

Gross margin sustains at 30% level 
As 95% of revenue comes from sale of properties, overall gross margin is largely affected 
by property development business. Overall gross margin was 29.0%/31.0%/32.5% in 
FY16/17/18. And gross margin of sales of properties was 28.0%/30.5%/32.7% in 
FY16/17/18. Cost of goods sold mainly includes land cost, construction cost and others. 
Land cost and construction together accounts for about 95% of cost of goods sold.  
Figure 22: Historical gross margin 
 
Source: Company data 
Figure 23: Breakdown of cost of goods sold 
 
Source: Company data 
 
Ratio of land cost to contracted ASP of new acquired land are stable at 40% level. We 
believe gross margin of sale of properties will sustain at 30% level in the future. However, 
due to price restriction, we do not expect gross margin to significantly improve. Thus, we 
forecast gross margin of sale of properties to be 32.5%/32.0%/32.0% in FY19E/20E/21E, 
and overall gross margin to be 32.3%/31.8%/31.8% in FY19E/20E/21E.

Taxes & surcharges, sell expenses, admin expenses, and R&D expenses together 
accounted for 13.5%/13.1%/13.1% of total revenue in FY16/17/18. We forecast these 
expenses to be stable during forecast period, which is 13.3%/13.1%/13.1% in 
FY19E/20E/21E. Therefore, EBIT is estimated to be RMB47.9bn/59.2bn/68.3bn in 
FY19E/20E/21E, representing 22.0% from FY18 to FY21.

Net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB12.4bn/15.6bn/18.9bn in FY16/17/18, 
respectively, representing net margin of 8.0%/10.7%/9.7%. We forecast net profit 
attributable to shareholders to be RMB26.0bn/30.8bn/35.3bn in FY19E/20E/21E, 
respectively, representing a CAGR of 23.1% next three years. Net margin, accordingly, is 
expected to be 10.2%/9.7%/9.7% in FY19E/20E/21E.

Net gearing is expected to decrease in FY19 due to cautious move in 
land acquisition 
Total borrowing was RMB204.7bn by FY18, of which 48.7bn was short term debt. Cash on 
hand was RMB113.4bn, which is sufficient to cover the short term debt. Net gearing was 
55.2%/86.4%/80.6% by FY16/17/18. In 5M19, Poly Development achieved contracted 
sales of RMB189.0bn, up 22% YoY. However, Poly Development has slowed down its 
investment in land acquisition. We believe this was mainly because of the Company’s 
cautious view on current land market, as land premium is rising rapidly in 5M19.Thus, we 
expect net gearing ratio to decrease in FY19, as the Company holds a stronger cash 
position due to less investment.

Although Poly Development slows down its land acquisition, the Company has already 
accumulated ample land bank to sustain the growth. Land bank, including GFA under 
construction and for future development, reached 195.44mn sq m by end-FY18, 17.8% or 
29.51mn sq m increase from end-FY17. With significant growth of new start area in FY19, 
we believe current land bank is sufficient for the next 3-4 years.

Valuation 
We estimate EPS of Poly Development to be RMB2.08/2.59/2.98 in FY19E/20E/21E. 
Current share price is trading at 6.5/5.3x FY19E/20E P/E, which is below its 5-year average 
forward P/E of 7.9x. We select 10 A-Share developers as peers. The peers are trading at 
6.2/5.2x FY19E/20E P/E in average. As a leading developer with SOE background and 
ample land bank, we believe Poly Development deserves a valuation premium. 
With 8.0x 19E P/E, which is peers’ mean plus 1 standard deviation and also closed to its 
5-year average forward P/E, our target price is derived at RMB16.64, indicating an upside 
potential of 29.8%. Initiate with BUY.

Industry analysis 
National property sales grew 6.1% in 5M19 but volume declined 1.6%. Although new start 
area grew 10% YoY, land acquisition area and accumulated land auction premium reduced 
33.2% and 35.6% YoY. Construction expenditure is recovering backed by the large new 
start area in 2H18, thus supporting the real estate investment (REI) in the near term.   
Market cooling down after Mar/Apr  
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released China property market data for 5M19. 
National property sales grew 6.1% YoY to RMB5.17tn but shadowed by 2.0ppt MoM growth 
decline (4M19: 8.1%) and 1.6% decline in sales volume. We believe volume decline is 
caused by weakening demand in tier 3/4 property market after its rally in 2017 and 2018. 
However, completed properties for sale continues to drop for 27 consecutive months since 
Feb 2017 to the same level of Feb 2014. Month for digestion has also dropped to 3.7 
months. Thus, we do not expect an extensive policy relaxation or any strong stimulus to 
property market. But we expect local governments in second tier cities to marginally relax 
housing policy in a timely manner to attract population and maintain local market stability.

New start declerates with sluggish land replenishment  
New start area grew 10% YoY, while MoM growth slowed down by 2.6ppt in May. 
Furthermore, land acquisition area and accumulated land auction premium significantly 
reduced 33.2% and 35.6% YoY, respectively. It may reflect the prudent attitude of property 
developers and weakening land market in third/fourth tier cities. Land acquisition area is a 
leading indicator of new start area. We expect new start area to continue to decelerate.

REI supported by construction expenditure  
REI grew 11.2% YoY for 5M19, slightly decelerating from 4M19 (11.9%) but still maintaining 
a double-digit growth. So far there is no data on 5M19 land expenditure and construction 
expenditure. But for 4M19, land expenditure and construction expenditure grew 29.7% and 
5.6% YoY, respectively. For the past 10 months, growth of land expenditure gradually 
decelerated which is consistent with land auction premium. However, construction 
expenditure or construction area, on the other hand, is recovering backed by the large new 
start area in 2H18. Looking forward, we think growth of construction expenditure will offset 
the diminishing new start and support the REI in the near term.

Housing price rose steadily in 5M19 but still controllable   
Several local governments have already marginally relaxed its housing restriction from the 
beginning of 2019 in order to attract population and support local economy. With sufficient 
mortgage supply in the beginning of year and declined mortgage rate, housing price in all 
tiers of cities rose in 5M19, but in a very slow way. Under current regulation framework of 
“One-city-one-policy”, local government would quickly react to any significant change of 
local property market, especially the housing price.

In the long run, we believe housing price in first tier cities can be supported by population 
influx and local industry. Housing price among second tier cities may vary by cities, 
depending on local economy and population growth. With the completion of shanty town 
redevelopment, some third tier cities may be hard to find a support if new demand is weak.

Major risks 
Real estate market downturn  
Poly Development’s business and prospects depend on the performance of the PRC 
property market.  Property markets in where the Company has operation are affected by 
local, regional, national and global factors, including economic and financial condition, 
speculative activities in local markets, demand for and supply of properties, investor 
confidence, availability of alternative investment choices for property buyers, inflation, 
government policies, interest rates and availability of capital. Any market downturn in China 
generally or cities in which Poly Development has or expects to have operations may 
materially and adversely affect the Company’s business, financial condition and results of 
operations. 
Unfavorable housing policy  
China property business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and in particular 
sensitive to policy changes in the PRC property sector. The PRC Government has 
promulgated various control measures in recent years, which aimed at cooling the property 
sector, and the government may adopt further measures to regulate this sector. If local 
governmental authorities adopt stricter regulation on property market in where Poly 
Development has or expects to have operations, it may have an adverse effect on the 
Company’s business, financial position and results of operations. 
Tightened financing condition  
Property development usually requires substantial capital investment throughout the 
process of project development. Poly Development’s property development projects have 
been generally funded through cash generated from operations including proceeds from 
the pre-sale of its properties, bank loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities 
programs and other financing arrangements. We expect the Company to continue to fund 
its projects through these sources. However, it cannot be ensured that such funds will be 
sufficient or any additional financing can be obtained on satisfactory or commercially 
reasonable terms, or at all. Meanwhile, the Company may experience negative net cash 
flow from its operating activities in the future. A negative net cash flow position for operating 
activities could impair the Company’s ability to make necessary capital expenditures, 
constrain operational flexibility and adversely affect its ability to expand business and 
enhance liquidity. 
Intense competition from other real estate developers  
There are a large number of property developers in the PRC and we expect the level of 
competition to increase over time. Intense competition among property developers in China 
for land, financing, construction materials and skilled management and human resources 
may result in increased cost for land acquisition and construction, an oversupply of 
properties available for sale, a decrease in property prices, a slowdown in the rate at which 
new property developments are approved or reviewed by the relevant PRC Government 
authorities and an increase in administrative costs for hiring or retaining qualified 
contractors and personnel. If Poly Development fails to compete effectively, its business 
operations and financial condition will suffer.  
Substantial level of borrowings 
Poly Development maintained a substantial level of borrowings to finance its operations 
during FY17 and FY18. As of FY16/17/18, the Company’s total outstanding interest-bearing

borrowings amounted to about RMB112.2bn/204.7bn/263.7bn, respectively. Accordingly, 
its net gearing ratio, as calculated by dividing total borrowings less cash and bank balances 
and restricted cash by total equity, was approximately 55.2%/86.4%/80.6%, respectively, 
in FY16/17/18. High indebtedness may increase the Company’s vulnerability to adverse 
conditions and limit its flexibility in the planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business. 
Potential failure on completing projects 
The schedules of the Company’s project developments and whether a project can be 
completed within the planned budgets depend on a number of factors, including the 
performance and efficiency of the Company’s third-party contractors and its ability to 
finance construction and the associated financing costs. Construction delays or failure to 
complete the construction of a project according to its planned specifications, schedule and 
budget may harm the Company’s reputation as a property developer, leading to loss of or 
delay in recognizing revenues and lower returns. In addition, if a property project is not 
completed on time, the purchasers of pre-sold units may be entitled to compensation for 
late delivery or may be able to terminate the pre-sale agreements and claim damages.
