SUMMARY. Poly Development announced the preliminary interim results as net profit 
soared by 59.1% to RMB10.4bn in 1H19. The strong results were attributable to the 
margin improvement and less deduction from minority interests. The reported 1H19 net 
profit accounted for about 41.9% and 44.5% of our and market’s full year 2019 forecast. 
We maintain our forecast and TP unchanged. Reiterate BUY recommendation. 
 
Interim results express. Poly Development announced the preliminary interim 
results. Revenue and net profit surged by 19.5% to RMB71.16bn and 59.1% to 
RMB10.4bn in 1H19, respectively. The strong results were attributable to higher 
gross margin and higher attributable ratio that resulted in less deduction from 
minority interest. As a result, operating margin and net margin expanded by 
3.5ppts YoY to 24.6% and 3.6ppts to 14.5% in 1H19, respectively. The reported 
1H19 net profit accounted for about 41.9% of our full year 2019 forecast or 44.5% 
of market consensus forecast. There will be chance of earnings revision later.  
 
Contracted sales grew 17.3% in 1H19. Contracted sales amount and area 
increased by 17.3% to RMB252.6bn and 12.6% to 16.37mn sq m in 1H19, 
respectively. Sales growth slowed down to 5.7% in Jun but the Company climbed 
the ranking from fifth position in 2018 to fourth in 1H19. We expect its full year 
contracted sales to be RMB480bn in 2019. In other words, hit rate was 52.6% as 
at Jun. We believe Poly Development could achieve our sales expectation that 
translates contracted sales growth to 18.6% in 2019, compared with contracted 
sales of RMB404.8bn in 2018. 
 
Prudent in land market. According to CRIC data, Poly Development acquired 
7.16mn sq m land bank in considerations of RMB46.6bn in 1H19. Compared with 
contracted sales in the same period, the Company is conservative to the land 
market because it believed land price was relative high. As at Mar 2019, the 
Company owned land bank of 230mn sq m that is sufficient to its long-term 
development since it plans to have 27.5mn sq m of properties completion in 2019, 
24% higher than 2018 actual completion of 22.17mn sq m. 
 
Maintain target price of RMB16.43. We maintain our earnings forecast 
unchanged as RMB24.7bn in 2019 and RMB30.9bn in 2020. However, we 
believe the market will revise upwards forecast following to the interim results 
announcement. We maintain our target price of RMB16.43, representing 7.9x 
2019E P/E. Reiterate BUY recommendation.
