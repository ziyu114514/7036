SUMMARY. Poly Development announced interim results as net profit soared by 53.3% 
to RMB10.0bn in 1H19. The strong results were attributable to the margin improvement 
and increase of delivery GFA. We maintain our forecast unchanged but raise TP to 
RMB20.72 after rolling over 2020E P/E. Reiterate BUY recommendation. 
 
Interim results jumped 53%. Revenue and net profit surged by 19.5% to 
RMB71.6bn and 53.3% to RMB10.0bn in 1H19, respectively. The strong results 
were driven by increase of delivery GFA and margin improvement. GM for 
property development expanded by 5.7ppts to 41.0% in 1H19. As a result, overall 
GM and NM improved to 39.8% and 18.2% in 1H19, respectively.  
 
Cash collection of RMB216.8bn in 1H19. Contracted sales amount and area 
increased by 17.3% to RMB252.6bn and 12.6% to 16.37mn sq m in 1H19, 
respectively. Cash collection ratio was 86% and cash proceeds from contracted 
sales amounted to RMB216.8bn in 1H19. So net gearing ratio stayed at healthy 
level of 76.6% as at Jun 2019. In Jul, Poly Development achieved contracted 
sales of RMB27bn that resulted in 58.3% of hit rate based on our full year 
contracted sales forecast of RMB480bn in 2019. Although property market 
sentiment becomes cloudy in 2H19, we believe Poly Development would achieve 
our sales forecast. 
 
8.26mn sq m land bank replenishment in 1H19. Poly Development acquired 
44 projects of 8.26mn sq m land bank for considerations of RMB53.3bn in 1H19. 
During the period, new starts and completion were 28.94mn sq m and 11.67mn 
sq m, respectively. As at Jun 2019, GFA under development and for future 
development were 110.7mn sq m and 76.2mn sq m, respectively. These land 
banks were mainly situated at the first and second tier cities or major city clusters. 
We estimate NAV to be RMB25.11 per share.  
 
Spin off property management business in HKEx. The Company is applying 
to spin off its property management business in HKEx. As at Apr 2019, it managed 
549 residential communities and 268 non-residential properties in 136 cities. Total 
contracted GFA reached 371.4mn sq m as at Apr 2019.  
 
Reiterate BUY and raise TP. We maintain our earnings forecast unchanged as 
RMB24.7bn in 2019 and RMB30.9bn in 2020. But we roll over our valuation to 
2020E, based on 8.0x P/E. We raise our target price from RMB16.43 to 
RMB20.72. Reiterate BUY recommendation.
