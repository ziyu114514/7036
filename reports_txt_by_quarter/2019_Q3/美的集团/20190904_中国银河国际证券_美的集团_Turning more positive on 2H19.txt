Midea 
Turning more positive on 2H19 
■ Midea’s 1H19 results surprised to the upside; net profit grew 16.5% YoY, above our 
expectation and consensus of 14% growth.     
■ Midea’s lower AC exposure should help it maintain its current margins in 2H19 in the 
face of possible competitive AC price cuts by competitors in 2H19.   
■ Midea is better positioned for the potential consumption stimulus due to its more 
diversified product offerings. 
■ We upgrade our rating to ADD and increase our TP from Rmb48.0 to Rmb60.0 to 
account for better-than-expected 1H19 earnings growth and improved margins in the 
AC and consumer appliance segments. 
1H19 results surprised to the upside  
Midea’s net profit grew 16% YoY to Rmb16.1b in 1H19, above our expectation and 
consensus of 14% growth. The net margin expanded by 0.8ppt YoY to 10.4%. Net profit
growth was helped mainly by 45.9% growth in interest income from wealth management 
product investment and cash deposits. Revenue grew 7.4% YoY, driven mainly by the
core AC and consumer appliance segments. The gross margin expanded by 2ppt to 
29.7% despite the AC sales promotion Midea started in Q1, thanks to lower raw material 
costs and higher ASPs in other key product categories, such as refrigerators. Operating 
margins grew only 0.5ppt to 10.9% owing to higher selling expense from promotions.  
Lower AC exposure should mean less margin erosion in 2H19 
Because of high channel inventory (4–5 months) and new AC energy-efficiency 
standards coming out at the end of 2019, we expect major AC makers to further cut 
ASPs in 2H19 to chase market share and trim inventory levels. ACs accounted for 46% 
of Midea’s total sales in 1H19, and we estimate refrigerators and washing machines
accounted for 10% of total sales each. In the face possible competitive AC price cuts in 
2H19, we expect Midea’s higher exposure in other key home appliance categories to help 
it minimize potential margin erosion in 2H19.  
Midea better positioned the for upcoming consumption stimulus 
On 27 Aug, the State Council released an Opinion to encourage local governments to 
support the sales promotion of energy efficient ACs, refrigerators and washing machines.
And earlier this year, the NDRC released a guideline to potentially boost home appliance 
sales by ~Rmb700b in 2019–2021. So far only Beijing and Guangxi have rolled out their 
stimulus plans, but we expect other regions to follow in 2H19 and 2020. We expect the 
new round of stimulus to focus more on replacement demand than new demand, as the 
penetration of major appliances is approaching saturation in both urban and rural areas.
We also expect the stimulus to benefit pure AC makers less, considering the current high 
channel inventory. We think Midea is an easily identifiable beneficiary of the stimulus 
because of its higher exposure to the mid- to high-end refrigerator, washing machine and 
key small appliance segments. 
Upgrade to ADD 
We upgrade our rating to ADD and increase our TP from Rmb48.0 to Rmb60.0 to
account for better-than-expected 1H19 earnings growth and improved margins in the AC 
and consumer appliances segments. We now value Midea at 14x 2020 earnings vs. the 
previous 13x, and raise our 2020 earnings projection by 16% to factor in the upcoming 
consumption stimulus. We continue to prefer Midea because of its stronger balance 
sheet, more diversified revenue mix and long-term product upgrade story.
