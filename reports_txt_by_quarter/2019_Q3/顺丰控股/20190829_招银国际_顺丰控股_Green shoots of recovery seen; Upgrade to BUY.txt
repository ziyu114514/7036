SF posted revenue/ adj. net profit increase of 20%/ 25% YoY in 2Q19, driven by 
1) accelerated volume growth backed by new preferential services and 2) 
rigorous cost control. We believe most of negatives have been reflected in current 
price, and expect 1) solid business presence in various new initiatives and 2) 
steady volume growth to boost further growth afterwards. We raised FY19/ 20E 
adj. EPS by 8%/ 7%, and upgraded it to BUY with TP of RMB46.53, representing 
39x/ 33x FY19/ 20E P/E.  
 Bottom-line beat in 2Q19. Since new business progressed robustly and 
volume growth recovered moderately in Jun, revenue increased 19% YoY, 
in line with our est. Adj. net profit reached RMB1,494mn (+25% YoY), 16% 
higher than our est, due to 1) improved loading rate and 2) continued cost 
cuts. Looking into 2H19E, we expect volume growth recovery to continue 
backed by 1) share gain in mid/low-end market and 2) further penetration 
into fresh products and upmarket categories. 
 Bullish on new initiatives. As pioneer in new business initiatives, SF 
progressed significantly through consistent heavy investment and close 
cooperation with global logistics giants (e.g. DHL). Revenue contribution 
from new business (cold chain, heavy cargo, supply chain and etc.) shot up 
from 16% in 1H18 to 24% in 1H19. Going forward, we believe SF’s first-
mover advantages will be better recognized in view of 1) brand recognition 
among enterprise customers, 2) economies of scale and 3) increasing entry 
barriers, against the backdrop of other major peers rushing to expand 
presence in those fields under LT growth pressure.  
 Ample cash reserve to fuel Capex. We expect Capex to be RMB11bn/ 
RMB13bn in FY19/ 20E mainly for warehouses and civil airport. Recently 
CSRC approved SF to issue CB as much as RMB5.8bn, and we believe it 
would help mitigate the Company’s financial pressure in NT. After financing, 
we forecast the cash on hand will be amounted to RMB19bn by End -FY19. 
If fully converted, the bond would dilute common shares by less than 3%, in 
our estimate.   
 Upgraded to BUY with TP of RMB46.53. We lifted our FY19-21E adj. EPS 
by 6-8% to reflect our upbeat outlook on volume recovery and new business. 
Therefore, we upgraded it to BUY and raised TP to RMB46.53, based on 
33x FY20E P/E (roll-over from previous 33x FY19E P/E).

Our FY19-21E EPS are 2-5% above consensus  
Considering better-than-expected volume recovery and margin expansion, we revised up 
FY19-21E adj. EPS by 6-8%. Our FY19-21E adj EPS are slightly above consensus, due to 
our more positive outlook on profitability and new business.

Valuation  
Upgraded to BUY with TP of RMB46.53 (17.5% upside) 
Our new 12-month TP of RMB46.53 is based on rolled-over 33x FY20E P/E. We estimate 
33% EPS FY18-20E CAGR, due to 1) 22% revenue CAGR and 2) upbeat margins as a 
result of better loading rate and solid cost control. We upgrade the Company to BUY due 
to our upward revise on FY19-21E adj. EPS and multiple roll-over. 
Key risks include 1) slower-than-expected e-commerce growth, and 2) greater-than-
expected ASP decline.
