SUMMARY. Driven by the growth of delivery GFA and ASP, net profit advanced by 
29.8% to RMB11.8bn in 1H19. We roll over our valuation to 8x 2020E P/E. As a result, 
we raise TP from RMB31.68 to RMB33.92. Maintain BUY recommendation. 
 
Net profit surged 30% in 1H19. Driven by 20.7% growth in delivery GFA and 
10.7% growth in ASP, revenue increased by 32.9% to RMB139.3bn in 1H19. GM 
improved from 33.7% in 1H18 to 36.2% in 1H19. SG&A expenses to revenue ratio 
stayed flat at 8.0%. So net profit increased by 29.8% to RMB11.8bn in 1H19. As 
at Jun 2019, properties pre-sold and unbooked amounted to RMB621.6bn. 
 
Contracted sales grew by 10% in 1H19. Contracted sales amount and area 
surged by 9.6% to RMB334bn and 5.6% to 21.50mn sq m in 1H19, respectively. 
In terms of geographical breakdown, sales amount in Shanghai Region and 
Central & Western Region accounted for 35.9% and 22.1% of total 
contracted sales in 1H19. Meanwhile, small and medium flats under 144 sq 
m accounted for 91% of residential sold in 1H19. Majority buyers were first 
time buyers or first time upgraders. In 1H19, 10.6mn sq m of properties were 
completed, up 15.6% YoY, and represented about 34.5% of full year plan. 
 
Acquired 13.73mn sq m land bank in 1H19. In 1H19, Vanke acquired 54 plots 
of land with total GFA of 13.73mn sq m (or attributable GFA of 9.42mn sq m) in 
1H19. As at Jun 2019, total and attributable land bank amounted to 153mn sq m 
and 92.93mn sq m, respectively. Moreover, Vanke participated in several urban 
redevelopment projects with aggregate attributable GFA of 3.41mn sq m. Current 
land bank is sufficient for next three years’ development. 
 
Robust growth in rental and property management. Rental income and 
revenue for property management increased by 82.1% to RMB2.09bn and 28.4% 
to RMB5.28bn in 1H19, respectively. As at Jun 2019, 82,000 leasing apartments 
in 35 cities were in operation. Furthermore, more than 13.5mn sq m of retail 
property were under Vanke’s management, of which 9.15mn sq m of retail 
projects (6.43mn sq m in operation) were under SCPG management. 
 
Raise TP to RMB33.92. Net gearing ratio was 35.0% as at Jun 2019. The 
balance sheet was healthy. We fine tune our earnings forecast and adjust 
upwards slightly. In addition, we roll over our valuation to 8x 2020E P/E, instead 
of 9x 2019E P/E. As a result, we raise TP from RMB31.68 to RMB33.92. Upside 
potential is 24.8%. Reiterate BUY recommendation.
