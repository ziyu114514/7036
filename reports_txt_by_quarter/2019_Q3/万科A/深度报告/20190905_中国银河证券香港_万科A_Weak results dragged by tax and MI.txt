China Vanke-A 
Weak results dragged by tax and MI 
■ Vanke A’s 1H19 results came in lower than expected with 11% earnings 
growth on higher-than-expected LAT provision and minority interests.   
■ We think Vanke should spin off its property management unit to unlock its 
huge potential value as the unit could fetch a price of at least 22x FY20 P/E.  
■ Maintain Add with a lower TP of Rmb32.6, based on 9x FY19 P/E. 
Weaker-than-expected results   
Vanke A announced a weaker-than-expected set of results, with 1H19 core net profit 
rising 11% yoy to Rmb11.6bn, 5% below our estimate, on the back of higher-than-
expected LAT provision and minority interests. 1H19 core net profit formed 30% of our 
FY19F. Net gearing was stable at 35% as at end-Jun 19.   
Lower margins ahead  
Its gross margin pre-land appreciation tax (LAT) was 28%, 1% pts above our estimate, 
due to the recognition of property sales in 2017 and 1H18 when the property market was 
very strong. Its high gross margin is unlikely to be sustained considering surging land 
costs, so we expect it to decline by 2% pts p.a. on average over FY19-21F. 
Slow contracted sales growth on its high sales base 
Vanke achieved contracted sales of Rmb382bn in 1H19, up 9% yoy. Contracted sales 
had grown at 29% CAGR in FY13-18. Given the high base, we expect high single-digit 
contracted sales growth in FY19-21F. As of end-Jun, it had sizeable unbooked sales of 
Rmb622bn. We expect most of this to be recognised in 2H19F and FY20F. Thus, we 
estimate that it has locked in over 95% of FY19F earnings and 50% of FY20F earnings. 
Vanke should spin off its property management unit  
Its property management (PM) unit’s revenue rose 27% yoy to Rmb5.3bn in 1H19. We 
expect the unit's revenue to surge to Rmb12bn in FY20F. Assuming a 10% net profit
margin and a target P/E of 22x for large-scale PM companies in FY20F, this unit may be 
worth c.Rmb30bn. In our view, Vanke should consider spinning off the unit due to 
favourable valuations for PM companies.  
Contribution from other businesses remains low 
It also owns a set of non-property development businesses, such as long-term rental 
housing, logistics and warehousing. However, they accounted for only 5% of its total 
revenue in 1H19. We think management should put more effort into improving overall 
earnings contribution in the medium- to long-term. 
Remain Add 
We cut our FY19-21F EPS by 5-9% to reflect higher tax and finance costs as well as its 
latest share placement. Our TP is lowered to Rmb32.6, still based on FY19F P/E of 9x (1 
s.d. above its 5-year avg). Key catalysts include stronger-than-expected contracted sales 
growth. Key downside risks include further tightening policies imposed by the 
government.
