CRSC-A 
Smart rail transportation industry leader, core 
business growth on track  
■ We initiate coverage on CRSC-A with a HOLD rating and a target price (TP) of 
Rmb9.60.  
■ CRSC-A had its total revenue grew 8.5% yoy and net profit grew 14.3% yoy in 1H19. 
The earnings growth in 1H19 was helped only by the core railway business. We 
expect its urban transit business growth to recover as well, which will further drive 
earnings growth acceleration in 2H19.  
■ We are positive on CRSC-A’s earnings growth outlook in medium-to-long term, 
considering its leading position in the smart rail transportation market. The Company 
is the key beneficiary from accelerating rail transportation investment from both 
central and local governments from 2019 onwards. CRSC-A currently traded on 24.5x 
2019F P/E, representing a 123.4% premium to its H-shares. The valuation is 
demanding compared to its H-shares, but we think its listing in SSE STAR Market will 
make its share price more resilient.   
1H19 delivered solid net profit growth of 14%  
Total revenue in 1H19 grew 8.5% yoy, driven only by its core railway business (Fig 1). Its
gross profit margin expanded by 1.3ppt yoy to 23.3% in 1H19, because of an improved
revenue mix. The Company scaled down its lower-margin cash construction business, 
while its higher-margin core railway business growth further accelerated in 1H19. Its 
urban transit business also saw gross profit margin expansion due to the increasing 
adoption of its own CBTC technology in its projects. SG&A costs rose more than revenue 
growth in 1H19. Its net profit margin expanded by 0.7ppt yoy in 1H19. Net profit grew 
14.3% yoy in 1H19 to Rmb2,268m, equivalent to 56% and 53% of our and consensus 
full-year earnings estimates, respectively.  
2H19 earnings growth expected to further accelerate  
We expect its urban transit business growth to recover in 2H19, which will further drive its 
earnings growth acceleration. CRSC remains confident that it can deliver double-digit 
revenue and earnings growth in 2019. CRSC expects its railway business revenue 
growth to continue in 2H19. Railway equipment demand growth will be driven by 
increases in new rail line additions in the 13th FYP and the deepening of railway operation 
reforms. CRSC reported that its railway business contract wins in 1H19 grew 30.1% yoy.
The central government has been promoting the development of urban transit networks 
to support economic growth and facilitate the development a few city clusters; hence,
investment in the urban transit network development started to reaccelerate in 2018. We 
trim our earnings forecast for the Company in 2019–2020 by only 2–4% to reflect 
weakness of the non-railway business. Overall, we expect its 2019F/2020F net profit to
grow 15.0%/23.7%. 
A-share listing to enhance R&D and bring new income streams 
The Company listed its A-shares on the SSE STAR Market in July. Proceeds from its A-
share listing will be used in 1) the R&D of advanced intelligent rail transportation, 2) the 
development of an advanced rail electrification system manufacturing base in Changsha,
3) the development of IT projects, and 4) the replenishment of working capital. These 
investments should produce new income streams for CRSC for its long-term business 
growth. With its strong position in the rail transportation control system market, the 
Company can leverage its technology and expertise to expand its product offerings along 
the smart rail transportation industry value chain. With more income coming from late-
cycle railway operations, CRSC’s earnings growth should become more sustainable.  
Initiate with HOLD 
We initiate coverage on CRSC-A with a HOLD rating and TP of Rmb9.60. Our TP is 
based on a target PER multiple of 21.5x, which is the average 2020 P/E of domestic 
peers. Our A-share TP represents a 55.3% premium to ourH-share TP. We think its A-
share valuation fully reflected its earnings growth potential in 2019-2020, but its listing in 
SSE STAR Market will make its share price more resilient.
