Eve Energy 
Positive outlook for the lithium battery business; 
potential regulatory risk for the e-cigarette segment 
■ We visited EVE Energy last week to discuss with management its business growth 
outlook for 2019–2020.  
■ Management gave positive guidance for its core lithium battery business growth 
outlook in 2019–2020, citing energy storage, power battery and IoT applications as 
the main drivers of business growth.  
■ Its fast-growing e-cigarette business (50% of total profit in 2018) might suffer from 
regulation risks in the near term. 
Leading player in the lithium battery and e-cigarette industry 
EVE Energy, founded in 2001, specializes in the production and sales of lithium battery 
products for use in smart meters, smart transportation, automotive electronics, the 
Internet of Things (IoT), consumer electronics, new energy vehicles (NEVs), and energy 
storage. The Company is also engaged in the production and sales of atomization 
products for e-cigarette companies through its 37.6% shareholding (as at end-1H19) in 
Shenzhen Smoore Technology (Smoore). Smoore is currently in the process of applying 
for an IPO in the Hong Kong market. The e-cigarette business, which has been booked 
under associate income since 2H17, generated about 50% of its earnings in 2018.  
Multiple demand growth drivers for its core battery business   
Management expects its primary lithium battery business revenue to reach Rmb2.1–
2.3bn in 2019, implying >80% yoy growth. This growth will be driven by rising ETC
(electronic toll collection) applications, as the central government intends to implement 
ETC nationwide on highways by the end of 2019. Management guided that its lithium-ion
battery business revenue will grow >50% yoy to Rmb4.9–5.0bn in 2019, led by consumer 
electronics and NEVs. Management remains confident about its primary lithium battery 
business growth outlook, citing China’s plans for large-scale development of its 5G 
network, which will provide demand growth opportunities for its products for IoT and 
energy storage. Its power battery products will also see revenue growth from its sales to 
Daimler and Kia from 2020. Management estimated that total revenue in 2020 would
grow >50% yoy to Rmb10bn. The Company will seek higher-quality earnings growth by 
focusing on larger customers, so we expect stable margins in 2019–2020.   
E-cigarette business growth subject to some regulatory risks  
Its e-cigarette business revenue grew 100% p.a. over the past three years, led by the 
rising popularity of e-cigarettes. Smoore is the market leader in supplying atomization 
products to e-cigarette companies worldwide. E-cigarette demand growth should be 
sustainable because of 1) replacement demand from old smokers, and 2) incremental 
demand from young people who just follow the fashion. But recent industry news 
indicates e-cigarette might be harmful to people’s health, so the US and other countries 
may consider banning e-cigarettes and its business might suffer from regulatory risks. But 
the impact is likely not that substantial according to management, as 1) tougher 
regulations might change industry dynamics, but emerging new market players will still 
have to rely on Smoore to supply the atomization products; and 2) tougher regulations
are likely only for flavored e-cigarettes, which account for only 30% of e-cigarette sales.  
Share price performance recently affected by regulatory concerns 
The Company’s share price more than doubled over the past 2–3 years, led by strong
market expectations for its e-cigarette business. But the share price recently fell c30% 
due to unfavorable industry news. The stock is trading at 19x 2020F P/E based on market 
consensus with a EPS growth of 34%. However, the EPS growth will depend on whether 
there are tighter regulations on e-cigarette..
