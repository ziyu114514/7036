Shanghai Pharmaceuticals-A 
Less attractive than its H shares; initiate with HOLD 
■ Overall, we are positive on Shanghai Pharma’s (SPH) fundamentals.  
■ However, the current AH spread of ~43% is at historical high, making SPH’s A shares 
less attractive than its H shares.  
■ Our Target Price for SPH’s A shares is Rmb20.0 (13x 2019F PER, 1sd below the 
historical average, comparable to our H-share target multiple, which is also 1sd below 
the average). We initiate SPH’s A shares with a HOLD rating. 
Manufacturing expected to continue its growth momentum 
The manufacturing segment delivered 24% YoY revenue growth in 1H2019 to 
RMB11.9bn. Strong revenue growth came from the fast ramp-up of 60 key products, 
whose sales came in at RMB6.77bn, up 31.3% YoY. Despite price pressure, the gross 
margin was 57.76%, up 0.1ppt from 1H2018, due to 1) fast growth of the 60 high-margin 
products; and 2) more stringent cost management on raw material procurement and 
manufacturing centralization. Going forward, we project revenue growth of 20%/17%/15% 
in 2019/20/21F, respectively. We expect the segment margin to be largely stable, as
~40% of the manufacturing segment is Chinese Traditional Medicines, and most of 
SPH’s chemical generics are in the low-cost drug catalogue, which are largely immune 
from Group Purchase Organization (GPO) pressure.  
Distribution margin pressure can be relieved somewhat  
The distribution segment delivered top-line growth of RMB80.19bn in 1H2019, up 21% 
YoY, and the gross margin was 6.49%, down 0.19 ppt from 1H2018. The distribution 
segment’s robust revenue growth was due to the industry’s organic growth (management 
guided ~8% YoY for 1H2019) and SPH’s M&A. The gross margin for the distribution 
segment was down 0.19 ppt in 1H2019. We believe the margin pressure came from drug 
price cuts. Going forward, we expect more margin pressure, considering 1) more 
stringent medical reimbursement standards and more stringent prescription requirements
for physicians; 2) a gradual impact of the GPO on drugs, as the first round of the GPO
was implemented only in late March in a few cities, so it had nearly no impact on the 
gross margin of 1H2019. However, we think 1) better-than-expected synergy with
Cardinal; 2) continuing industry consolidation under the two invoice system; and 3) a 
higher percentage of direct sales and a product mix change will help mitigate gross 
margin pressure.     
Catalysts ahead  
We believe near-term catalysts include 1) a growing stake increase by Shanghai 
Shangshi (SPH’s largest shareholder, holding a 33.6% stake); 2) news flow on its R&D 
pipeline; and 3) updates on collaboration with BIOCAD.      
Large AH premium makes SPH’s A shares less attractive than its H 
shares    
Currently, SPH’s AH spread remains at 43%, which is a historical high (Figure 1), 
making SPH’s A shares less attractive than its H shares. We believe the current large 
AH spread may indicate H-share investors are more conservative than A-share 
investors about the pharmaceutical industry growth slowdown and potential distribution 
segment gross margin pressure from the GPO. The Hang Seng AH Premium Index is 
also near 3-year high, partly because of the social unrest in Hong Kong. A high AH 
premium reduces the attractiveness of the SPH’s A shares. Our target price of Rmb20 
for SPH-A implies a 26.4% premium over our target price for SPH-H, not a big 
difference compared with the average A-H spread of 31% in the past few years.

Solid 1H2019 results highlights   
 1H2019 net profit was RMB2.286bn, up 12.4% YoY, accounting for 52.2% and 53.3% 
respectively of our and the Street’s 2019E full-year estimates (vs. 52.4% for 1H2018), 
in line with our expectations and slightly beating market expectations.      
 The manufacturing segment delivered 24% YoY revenue growth to RMB11.9bn with a 
57.76% gross margin, up 0.1ppt from 1H2018. The strong revenue growth came from 
the fast ramp-up of the 60 key products, whose sales came in at RMB6.77bn, up 31.3% 
YoY.  
 The distribution segment delivered top-line growth of RMB80.19bn, up 21% YoY, and 
the gross margin was 6.49%, down 0.19 ppt from 1H2018. The distribution segment’s 
robust revenue growth was due to the industry’s organic growth (management guided 
~8% YoY for 1H2019) and SPH’s M&A.  
 We note that SPH enhanced its cash collections in 1H2019. Operating cash inflow in 
1H2019 was RMB2.02bn, up 87% YoY from RMB1.08bn in 1H2018. Its major balance 
sheet items remained healthy.
