On 28 Aug, CCB reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 154.2bn, up 4.9% YoY and 
accounting for 57.0%/58.4% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. 1H19 
PPoP had a decent growth of 6.7% YoY. Net interest income rose moderately 
by 4.6% YoY as margin narrowed, yet non-interest income (incl. fees, trading 
gains, and investment return) picked up 12.8% YoY. Thanks to slower 
expansion in opex and impairment charges, bottom-line earnings grew faster at 
5.5%% YoY in 2Q19 (vs 4.2% YoY in 1Q19). 1H19 annualized ROE declined 
1ppt YoY to 15.9%, still the highest of the Big-4 banks.  We initiate coverage 
on CCB A-share with BUY rating. 
 Results positive: 1) 1H19 net fee income was up 11.1% YoY, driven by 
bank card, wealth management, and electronic banking services. As a result, 
CCB’s non-interest income as of total revenue increased 1.5ppt YoY to 
27.2%; 2) Asset quality continued to improve, as NPL ratio fell 3bp QoQ 
to 1.43% and provision coverage climbed 3.8ppt to 218%. However, we note 
that overdue loans rebounded 18.2% HoH, and we would seek for 
management’s explanation during results briefing. 3) Credit growth was 
prudent. The Bank maintained a stable growth in mortgage (+5.3% HoH) 
while reduced personal consumption loan (-17.1% HoH). Lending to utility 
and construction segments, and discounted bills accounted for near 50% of 
new corporate loans. 4) Capital position remained strongest in the 
sector, as CET 1/total CAR only slid 13bp/8bp QoQ to 13.7%/17.1% due to 
appropriation of cash dividend in 2Q19.  
 Results negative: 1) 2Q19 NIM contracted 4bp QoQ to 2.25%, as liability 
cost went up faster than asset yield. Given higher proportion of deposit 
funding, CCB may not benefit as much as most joint-stock peers during 
monetary loosening, but we believe the weaker margin trend was within 
expectation. 2) Proportion of demand deposit fell 0.5% HoH to 53.1%, 
leading to rising deposit cost thereby smaller net interest spread. 3) Asset 
growth slowed to 0.8% in 2Q19 from 4.2% in 1Q19, as interbank assets 
pulled back 17% QoQ. 
 Initiate CCB-A with BUY rating and RMB 8.8 TP. We expect a positive 
share price reaction to 1H19 results. CCB-A currently trades at 0.83x FY19E 
P/B, in line with its past 5-year mean. Our TP of RMB 8.8 is based on GGM-
derived target P/B of 1.05x and FY19E BPS of RMB 8.3.

Valuation  
We use Gordon Growth Model to derive the TP for CCB-A. Our key assumptions include: 
1) Cost of equity of 12.5%, 2) Sustainable ROE of 13.0%; 3) Long-term growth rate of 
3.0%. Our TP of RMB 8.8 is based on a target P/B of 1.05 x and FY19E BVPS of RMB 
8.3.
