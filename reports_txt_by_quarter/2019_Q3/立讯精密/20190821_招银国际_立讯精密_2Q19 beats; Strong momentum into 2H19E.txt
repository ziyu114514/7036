Summary. Luxshare reported 2Q19 revenue/net profit growth of 88%/80% YoY, 
beating consensus and mid-point of guidance of 60-93% YoY, mainly due to 
stronger communication and consumer electronics, despite slightly lower GPM. 
Luxshare also guided a strong 9M19 NP with 50-60% YoY, implying 18-38% YoY 
for 3Q19 NP, in-line with our/consensus estimates. Luxshare is our A-share top 
pick given its share gain in iPhone/Airpod in 2H19E and major 5G beneficiary into 
2020. Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB32.1 based on 25x FY20E P/E.  
 
Strong 2Q19 revenue across all segment. Luxshare’s 2Q19 revenue 
growth accelerated to 88% YoY, vs 67% YoY in 1Q. By segment, consumer 
electronics segment was the key driver with 99% YoY (78% of 1H19 sales), 
thanks to share gain in AirPod/acoustics/haptics and expanding offerings 
into LCP antenna and wireless charging modules. In addition, 
communications/automotive/other connectors also delivered robust growth 
with 52%/46%/164% YoY in 1H19E. GPM was flattish at 19.5% given higher 
mix of consumer electronics, while better operating leverage was partly 
offset by higher effective tax rate of 15.8% in 2Q19 (vs 9.3% in 2Q18). 
 
New projects on track to boost growth. We believe Luxshare will continue 
to broaden penetration into Apple supply chain in 2H19E ranging from 
Macbook/ iPad to iPhone and wearables (Watch/ AirPods). Despite iPhone 
weakness in 2019, we expect share gain, content growth to boost earnings 
growth in 2H19E. We also expect Luxshare to benefit from strong Airpod 
shipment and upgrade with 55mn/ 80mn/90mn units in FY19/20/21E.  
 Outlook: major 5G beneficiary and limited trade war impact. Looking 
ahead, we believe Luxshare is well placed to capture 5G opportunities in 
2020-21E given its solid product roadmap, including 1) massive MIMO and 
new compact filter-antenna and 2) optical solutions in datacenter/telecom 
equipment. In addition, Luxshare is aggressively expanding capacity in 
Vietnam in order to mitigate tariff impact in 2H19E/2020E. 
 Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB32.1. We fine-tuned our FY19-21E EPS 
estimates, to factor in stronger revenue growth and higher tax rate. We 
maintained our TP RMB32.1, based on 25x FY20E P/E, 11% discount to 5-
year average of 28x. Upcoming catalysts include launch of new Airpod and 
China 5G service launch.

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY with TP of Rmb32.1 (26% upside) 
We derived our 12m TP of RMB32.0 based on 25x FY20E P/E, 11% discount to its 5-year 
historical average of 28.2x. We believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver 
strong earnings growth, market share gain and product expansion to capture 5G and 
wireless opportunities in next 3-5 years.   
Upcoming catalysts include launch of new-gen Airpod and iPhone in 2H19E and China 5G 
commercial service launch. Major risks include weaker Airpod demand, weaker yield 
improvement for acoustics/haptics and slower integration of acquired businesses.
