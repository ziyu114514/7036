On 27 Aug, CITICB reported 1H19 net profit of RMB 28.3bn, up 10.1% YoY and 
accounting for 60.5%/61.8% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. For 2Q19, 
PPoP maintained a double-digit growth of 10.1% YoY (vs 23.4% YoY in 1Q19), 
on the back of strong net interest income (+13.7% YoY) and net fee income 
(+12.8% YoY), despite lower trading and investment return (-17.8% YoY). With 
modest growth in provision charge (+9.9% YoY), bottom-line earnings picked up 
faster at 11.3% YoY (vs 8.6% YoY in 1Q19). 1H19 annualized ROE slid 0.1ppt 
YoY to 13.8%. We initiate coverage on CITICB’s A-share with BUY rating.  
 Results positives: 1) Loan growth accelerated to 6.3% in 1H19 (vs 5.7% 
in 1H18), primarily boosted by retail segment (+11.0% HoH), esp. mortgage 
and credit card. That said, asset quality of retail loans was well controlled, as 
retail NPL ratio edged down 10bp HoH to 0.9%. We believe higher retail 
exposure (+1.8ppt HoH to 43%) would underpin a better-than-peers margin 
trend amid LPR implementation process. 2) Deposit growth was robust at 
10.5% HoH, despite lower proportion of demand deposits As a result, LDR 
declined 3.8ppt to 95.1%. 3) 1H19 CIR fell 1.3ppt YoY to 26.5%, 
suggesting improving operating efficiency.  
 Results negatives: 1) Provision coverage dropped 4.7ppt QoQ to 
165.2%, lower than JSBs’ average of 193%. NPL balance rose 3% QoQ on 
faster formation, yet NPL ratio was unchanged at 1.72%. There might be 
limited room to further lower credit cost until the Bank builds a more 
comfortable provision buffer. 2) 2Q19 NIM stayed flat at 1.96%, as lower 
interbank funding cost was offset by higher deposit cost amid deposit 
competition. Loan yield retreated 6bp HoH, due to lower yield for retail loans 
and discounted bills. 3) CET-1 and total CAR fell 19bp/36bp QoQ to 
8.58%/12.27%. The Bank has issued RMB 40bn CB in Mar 2019, but 
conversion may take time given its below-book valuation.   
 Initiate CITICB-A with BUY rating and RMB 6.7 TP. CITICB-A currently 
trades at 0.62x FY19E P/B, 21% below its past 5-year mean of 0.78x. Our 
TP of RMB 6.7 is based on GGM-derived target P/B of 0.75x and FY19E 
BPS of RMB 8.9.
