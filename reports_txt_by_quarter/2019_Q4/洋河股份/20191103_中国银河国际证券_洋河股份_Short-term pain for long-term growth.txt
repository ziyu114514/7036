Jiangsu Yanghe Brewery 
Short-term pain for long-term growth  
■ Yanghe’s 3Q19 sales declined 21% yoy to Rmb5bn, and its net profit dropped 23% 
yoy to Rmb1.6bn, weaker than the market and our expectations.  
■ Yanghe’s distribution network has faced challenges since 2Q19, but we expect the 
company to overcome these issues and return to normal growth in 2H20F.   
■ Downgrade to Hold with a DCF-based TP of Rmb108. 
High channel inventory negatively impacted 3Q19 sales   
Yanghe reported lackluster 9M19 sales growth of 0.6% yoy to Rmb21bn, with net profit 
up 2% yoy to Rmb7bn, below our expectations. In 3Q19, sales declined by 21% yoy, and
net profit dropped by 23% yoy, mainly because Yanghe partially stopped shipments to
distributors to digest high channel inventory in 3Q19. According to Yanghe management, 
channel inventory gradually fell to about 2.5 months at the end of 3Q19 from a peak of 
four months in 2Q19. Management expects this to revert to the normal level of 1.5
months by the year end. Advance payment from customers decreased 29% yoy to 
Rm2bn at the end of 3Q19.  
Still in recovery mode  
Yanghe reduced its sales rebate to distributors earlier this year, which made its 
distributors’ profit margins lower than those of its peers, such as King’s Luck and 
Wuliangye, and reduced distributors’ motivation. Yanghe took action to overcome the
current challenges with its distribution network in 3Q19. It reduced shipments to
distributors to clean up channel inventory and improved its relationship with its 
distributors. Yanghe also started strengthening management of its sales team of over 
7,000. In July 2019, Yanghe recruited Mr Liu Hua Xiang to return as Vice President. Mr 
Liu was in charge of Yanghe’s sales and marketing department for many years, so he 
has plenty of experience dealing with distributors. In 3Q19, the Company’s S&D
expenses ratio increased by 5.1%pts yoy to 17.6% from 12.6%. We expect Yanghe to
make further efforts to increase the retail price of its core brand Blue Dream and forecast 
that the S&D expenses ratio will expand by 1.6%pts yoy to 12.2% in FY20F from 11.5% 
in FY19F. We expect Yanghe to overcome the distribution network concerns in 2H20F. 
Share repurchase expected to increase management motivation  
Yanghe announced that it would spend Rmb1–Rmb1.5bn on a share buy-back plan 
during the next 12 months, with a cap repurchase price of Rmb135 per share. Based on 
this price, Yanghe will buy back 0.7% of the total issued shares in the next 12 months.
These shares will be used for a share option program for key employees in the future. 
The current management team’s equity interest was less than 1% of total shares as at 
the end of 1H19. We expect share option plan for key employees to benefit Yanghe’s 
long-term development.  
Downgrade to Hold with a DCF-based TP of Rmb108   
We revised down our FY19F–21F EPS by 10%/6%/1%, reflecting Yanghe’s weaker-than-
expected sales performance, because if the short-term challenges with its distribution 
network. In the longer term, we think Yanghe’s diversified premium product portfolio and 
well-built distribution network will help the company back to healthy growth as it regains
market confidence in the brand. Downside risks include 1) a longer-than-expected time to 
improve its relationship with its distributors; and 2) more intense market competition, 
particular in Yanghe’s home market – Jiangsu province. Positive catalysts include 1) 
stronger growth in the new markets, and 2) a quicker-than-expected solution to
distribution problem.
