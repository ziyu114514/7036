ABC reported 9M19 net profit of RMB 180.7bn, up 5.3% YoY and accounting for 
85.5%/86.0% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. In 3Q19, PPOP declined 
by 2.3%% YoY, due to lower non-interest income (-4.9% YoY) and higher opex 
(+4.5% YoY). However, the stronger-than-peers provision buffer enabled the 
Bank to set aside less impairment charges (-14.9% YoY) and ensure a pick-up 
in bottom-line earnings growth to 6.1% YoY (vs 4.9% YoY in 1H19). 9M19 
annualized ROE fell 1.2ppts YoY to 14.6%.   
 Results positives: 1) NIM widened 1bp QoQ by our estimate, likely on 
decent management in funding cost and adjustment in liability structure. 
ABC’s market-based funding (incl. interbank, debt, NCD) was up 5.5% in 
3Q19. 2) Loan growth remained healthy at 2.8% QoQ, stronger than other 
SOE banks that disclosed 3Q19 results so far. Loans extended to county 
area saw faster growth (3.1% QoQ) than that of total loans. 3) Solid asset 
quality trend. The overall NPL ratio slid 1bp QoQ to 1.42%, the 13th 
consecutive quarterly decline. In particular, NPL ratio of county area banking 
business fell 7bps QoQ to 1.75%. Provision coverage climbed 2.9ppt QoQ to 
281.3%, the highest among Big-4 banks, offering greater room to reduce 
credit cost. 4) Capital adequacy improved. CET1/tier-1/total CAR edged up 
by 6bps/83bps/62bps QoQ to 11.19%/12.50%/16.10%, following the RMB 
120bn perpetual bonds issuance. 
 Results negatives: 1) 3Q19 revenue declined 0.2% YoY, as trading and 
investment return dropped 40% YoY due to decrease in net gain on principal 
guaranteed WMPs, while net interest income and net fee income were 
largely stable. 3) 3Q19 opex rose 4.5% YoY, leading to a higher CIR of 
32.7%. 3) Deposits growth was soft at 1.0% QoQ, slower than loan growth, 
thus LDR rose 1.2ppts to 71.2%.   
 Maintain BUY and raise TP to RMB 5.1. ABC-A currently trades at 0.74x 
FY19E P/B, similar to its past 5-year mean of 0.75x. We kept our earnings 
forecast unchanged and rolled forward the valuation basis to FY20. Our new 
RMB 5.1 TP is derived from 0.94x target P/B and FY20E BVPS of RMB 5.4.
