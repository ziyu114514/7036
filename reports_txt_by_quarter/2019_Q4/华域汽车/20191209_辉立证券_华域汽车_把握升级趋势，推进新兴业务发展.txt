投資概要 
第三季度淨利下降幅度收窄 
華域汽車2019 年前三季度公司累計實現營業收入1055.96 億元，同比下降11.11%，歸
母淨利潤49.27 億元，同比减少22.58%。如剔除去年同期收購小糸車燈帶來的一次性
投資收益等因素影響，前三季度歸屬于股東的扣除非經常性損益的淨利潤同比下降
13.90%，至41.8 億元。  
第三季度營業收入爲350.33 億，同比下降5.75%，歸母淨利潤15.63 億元，基本持
平，同比小幅减少1.7%，對應每股收益0.4956 元。第三季度的營收和淨利的下降幅度
大幅收窄。 
 
結構優化，毛利率逆勢保持穩定 
公司第一大客戶上汽集團前三季産量下滑16.0%，但受益于客戶結構調整（上汽大衆
占比提高）和海外業務（延峰內飾海外）拉動，華域汽車收入下降情况好于主要客
戶，基本與行業持平。第三季業務構成來看，內外飾件/功能件/金屬成型與模具/電子
電器件的收入分別錄得253/71/27/10.6 億元（-3.1%/-6.2%/-8.8%/+2%），淨利潤分別
貢獻7.8/5.1/0.9/0.7 億元（+5.4%/-21.5%/-18.2%/-22%）。另外，主要原材料價格有所
回落，前三季度毛利率爲14.5%，同比增加0.7 個百分點。第三季度毛利率爲14.2%，
環比下降0.8 個百分點，主要因國慶放假、生産綫維修及部分客戶國六産品切換等因
素。 
 
費用管控加强，加大研發投入提升競爭力 
前三季度銷售、管理和研發費用率分別爲1.37%/5.6%/3.63%，同比分別-0.07/-0.06/+1.0
個點。管理和銷售費用率的下降反映公司繼續降本控費。研發費用率提升體現公司在
行業下行階段依然不斷加强研發力度，以保障長期競爭力。 
 
經營現金流大幅改善，經營效率提升 
受益于車市降幅收窄、整車廠回款較好與公司控制支出，前三季度公司現金流顯著好
轉，淨流入10.9 億。經營活動現金流淨額爲66.25 億元，同比增長49.9%。存貨從期
初的114.1 億元下降到95.4 億元，經營效率提升。 
 
把握升級趨勢，推進新興業務發展 
背靠實力雄厚的上汽集團，華域汽車在客戶/研發/網絡布局/資金等方面競爭優勢明
顯，在汽車行業“電動化、網聯化、智能化、共享化”的發展賽道上開始取得成績。
子公司延鋒汽車內飾獲得寶馬X5、奔馳206 等平臺的全套內飾全球業務定點；華域視
覺、博世華域分別獲得廣汽豐田車燈、廣汽本田轉向系統等業務定點；旗下汽車模
具、座椅、車外飾産品分別獲得特斯拉上海國産車型電池盒及車身分拼總成件，側
圍、後蓋模具，座椅整椅，保險杠等業務定點。
