Inner Mongolia Yili Indus-A 
Better margin expansion in 3Q19  
■ Yili reported net profit growth of 15.5% in 3Q19 and 11.6% yoy in 9M19, slightly better 
than we expected, mainly because of stronger margin expansion.  
■ We expect Yili to continue to upgrade its product mix to drive up its margins in 4Q19F 
and FY20F.   
■ Management expects the raw milk price to increase 5–6% yoy in FY20F, which should 
lead to a reduction in promotion levels.   
■ Maintain Add with new DCF-based TP of Rmb34.5. 
Stronger-than-expected 3Q19 results  
Yili’s revenue grew 10.8% and 12.6% yoy in 3Q19 and 9M19. We estimate that sales 
volume grew 6–7% yoy in 9M19, and a mix upgrade drove up the ASP by 4%. Yili also 
reduced its pricing promotion in 9M19, which led to ASP improvement of c.2%. Its gross 
margin expanded 0.3ppt yoy to 35.5% in 3Q19, since the mix upgrade and promotion 
reduction fully offset the raw milk price increase. Yili said the raw milk price was up 8.5% 
yoy in 3Q19 and 7% yoy in 9M19, due to strong downstream dairy demand. Yili 
continued to gain market share in 9M19, gaining a 2ppt yoy market share for liquid milk to 
38.8% by end-3Q19. According to ACNielsen data, the industry volume growth of liquid 
milk was 2% in 9M19, with normal temperature milk up 3% and low temperature products 
down 2.5%. We now expect Yili’s revenue to grow 12.8%/11.4% yoy in FY19F/FY20F.      
Mix upgrade to continue  
Yili continued product premiumization in 3Q19, and sales of high-end products continued
to grow faster. Sales of its high-end UHT milk, Santine, and room temperature yoghurt, 
Ambrosial, grew 17% and 17.8% yoy in 9M19 (3Q19: high-teens and 15% yoy growth). 
Sales of high-end infant milk powder increased 28.6% yoy in 8M19. Yili launched dream 
cover organic Santine milk with protein content of 3.8g in Sep, and will launch fat free 
dream cover soon. It will also launch new low-temperature products in 4Q19F. We expect 
low temperature sales growth to return to positive yoy in FY20F, from -1% yoy in 9M19, 
and Yili to continue to upgrade its product mix to drive up margins in 4Q19F and FY20F. 
Exploring new business opportunities  
Yili set up healthy drinks and cheese business units in 2H18, and launched a soy milk 
drink last year. Management expects soy milk sales to grow in the mid-teens yoy in 
FY19F to Rmb500m–600m. Children’s cheese launched early this year received positive 
market feedback. This month, Yili launched mineral water products and will expand its 
water capacity in FY20–21F. Currently, Yili has c.2,000 distributors for its healthy drinks, 
half of them existing dairy distributors and the remaining half new.  
Promotion levels to fall gradually  
Because of a reduction in promotion and good operating leverage, its distribution 
expenses ratio was down by 2.4%pts yoy in 3Q19, which completely offset the increase 
in the G&A expenses ratio of 1.3%pts, leading to OPM improvement of 0.8%ppt yoy to 
9.6% in 3Q19. Management expects the raw milk price to increase 5–6% yoy in FY20F, 
which should lead to a reduction in promotion levels. We expect Yili to maintain stable 
OPM yoy in FY20F. 
Maintain Add with new DCF-based TP of Rmb34.5   
We fine tuned our FY19–21F earnings forecasts by 1.5%/0.9%/-2.7% to reflect better 
margin assumptions and expenses related to Yili’s restricted share plan. We maintain our 
Add rating, since we like Yili’s product premiumization and lower promotion level. A
positive catalyst is stronger margin expansion owing to better control of expenses. And 
the main risk is higher-than-expected raw milk prices.
