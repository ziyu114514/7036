China Life announced 9M19 set of result on 29 Oct 2019, which is highlighted by 
1) net profit surge, mainly coming from investment gains and also from tax benefit; 
2) satisfactory progress of underwriting business transition; and accordingly, 3) 
outstanding NBV growth. We stay bullish on the Company’s near-term financial 
performance for the whole year and its long-term outlook as well since business 
reform initiatives have been reviving the largest lifer in China profoundly. 
 
Net profit surged 190% YoY to RMB 57.7bn (~88% of our revised FY19E 
net profit), thanks to 1) investment gains. Investment income increased 
88.2% YoY in 9M19 to ~RMB125.6bn according to our calculation. Realized 
gains and fair value gains from equity investment have contributed to the 
majority of improvement. 2) One-off tax benefit of RMB 5.2bn, deducting 
which net profit would increase164% YoY in 9M19. 
 
Life transition underwent satisfactory progress. 1) Premium structure 
continued to optimize, with longer payment durations and more protection-
oriented products. FYRP with 10y+ payment duration accounted for 51.06% 
of FYRP in 9M19, up 15.7ppt YoY. The share of designated protection-
oriented products increased 8.79ppt YoY. 2) Agent headcount maintained 
steady growth. As of 30 Sep 2019, individual agents amounted to 1.663 
million, up 15.6% from YE18 and 5.7% from 2Q19. Monthly average 
productive agents increased 37.4% YoY. 
 
Solid NBV growth. New business value achieved 20.4% YoY growth in 
9M19, outperforming major peers.  The figure was largely in line with our 
annual NBV growth estimate at 16.4% (1Q/1H NBV growth was 
28.3%/26.2%, respectively). Our growth forecast is slightly lower than 9M19 
number due to a higher base in 2H18. 
 
Risks. 1) Capital market volatilities in 4Q; 2) Challenges with respect to 
agent team management and quality improvement. 
 
Raise TP to RMB 38.04. We roll over valuation basis to FY20E. We raise 
TP to RMB 38.04 based on H-share TP plus historical average A/H premium 
of 50%. The A-share stock is now trading at 0.84x FY20E P/EV, close to 
historical average minus 1 STD. We remain bullish on the Company’s near-
term financial performance as well as long-term business prospect. 
Reiterate BUY.
