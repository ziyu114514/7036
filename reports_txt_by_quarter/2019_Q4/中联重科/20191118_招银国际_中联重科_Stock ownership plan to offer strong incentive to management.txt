What’s new? We believe the stock ownership plan that announced last Friday 
will offer strong motivation to the management and key employees to deliver 
sustainable earnings growth over the next three years, which should more than 
offset the share incentive expense arising from this. We maintain our TP of 
RMB7.28 (based on 1.4x 2019E P/B, on the back of 12%-13% ROE in 2019E-
21E). Reiterate BUY.      
 Details of the stock ownership plan. The participants include the core 
management and key employees in the Company, with a maximum of 1,200 
employees. The purchase price is set at RMB2.75 per share. The lock-up 
period is divided into three stages, with 40%, 30% and 30% of the shares to 
be unlocked in 2020E, 2021E and 2022E respectively, subject to Zoomlion’s 
net profit targets during the period. Either of the following two criteria has to 
be satisfied for each of the year: (1) In 2020/ 21/ 22, the net profit growth to 
be no less than 80%/90%/100%, compared with the Benchmark (Benchmark 
= average net profit in 2017-19); (2) the total net profit in 2020-21 to grow 170% 
from the Benchmark, and the total net profit in 2020-22 to grow 270% from the 
Benchmark (Figure 1). The stock ownership plan is subject to the approval by 
shareholders in EGM.    
 Higher expense but higher employee incentive. Given that the underlying 
shares of the stock ownership plan are the 390mn A shares (4.96% of total 
o/s shares) the Company repurchased in 2Q19 (average price: RMB5.49), we 
calculate that the total share incentive expense to Zoomlion to be RMB1bn in 
2020E-22E. That’s said, we believe the discount on purchase price (RMB2.75) 
is attractive to the participants, offering strong incentive.      
 Investment in agricultural machinery segment. Zoomlion plans to invest 
RMB2.05bn in 2020-25 (annual capex: RMB342mn) in the intelligent 
agriculture machinery business in Wuhu. While the industry has been on a 
downcycle, Zoomlion expects the favourable government policy to support the 
upgrade of agriculture machinery will offer new opportunities. In 2018/1H19, 
revenue from agricultural machinery accounted for only 5%/4% of the total 
revenue. Zoomlion targets to achieve breakeven this year versus a loss in 
2018. We fine-tuned our 2020E-21E earnings forecast by -0.5%/-0.5% after 
incorporating the capex but have not modelled growth in this segment. Any 
improvement will offer upside to our existing forecast.

Key catalysts: Rising infrastructure spending, resilient growth of property area under 
construction, replacement of national emission standard (NES) III trucks, and market share 
gain on tower crane and concrete machinery will all serve as share price catalysts. 
Risk factors: (1) Unexpected weakness on property construction activities; (2) Slow 
recovery of infrastructure spending; (3) High earnings volatility.
