Kweichow Moutai 
Direct sales continue to increase  
■ Moutai’s distribution channel changes are on track; the direct sales contribution 
improved to 7% in 3Q19 from 4.1% in 1H19. 
■ We expect the direct sales contribution to further increase in 4Q19F. We also forecast 
that FY19F net profit will grow 23% yoy. 
■ We expect Moutai to supply 1Q20 volume to the market ahead of schedule to 
maintain no further hikes in the current first-layer wholesaler price.    
■ Maintain Add with an unchanged DCF-based TP of Rmb1,328 (WACC:10%)  
Modest sales growth in 3Q19, but net profit growth in line  
Moutai’s baijiu sales grew 14% yoy in 3Q19, a bit slower than the 18% yoy in 1H19. But
net profit grew 17% yoy in 3Q19, driven by a continuous mix upgrade, an increase in 
direct sales, and better control of expenses. Moutai’s 9M19 baijiu sales grew by 17% yoy
to Rmb61bn, and its net profit was up by 23% yoy to Rmb30.5bn, in line with our 
expectations. Moutai’s distribution network changes are still ongoing; for the domestic 
distributors channel, Moutai has cut 616 Moutai brand distributors year to date to 2,401
distributors; and the direct sales channel build-up is on track. The direct sales 
contribution improved to 7% in 3Q19 from 4.1% in 1H19. We expect Moutai to accelerate 
its supply volume to direct sales channels in 4Q19 and forecast that its FY19F net profit 
will grow 23% yoy. 
Continually improving margin owing to a product structure upgrade 
Moutai’s 9M19 gross profit margin was 91.5%, up by 0.4%pt, due to a product structure 
upgrade. Its sales tax was down by 2%pts to 13%. The S&D expenses ratio fell by 
1.2%pts to 4.3%, because of a decrease in the promotion of the Series brand. Moutai’s 
net profit margin improved by 2.6%pts to 50% in 9M19. With direct sales improving and 
continuous upgrading of its product structure, we expect Moutai’s profitability to further 
improve in FY20F.   
Controlled price hikes to stimulate consumption  
Moutai had direct sales of Rmb3.1bn in 9M19; its sales contribution improved to 5.1% in
9M19, from 4.1% in 1H19. In Sep 2019, Moutai increased its direct sales collaboration
with hypermarket and ecommerce channels, supplying 600t of Moutai liquor to three 
hypermarkets – Wumart, Sun Art and China Resources – and 400t to two online 
platforms – Suning and Tmall. Moutai also announced the advance supply of 4Q19
volume to its distributors. These actions have had a positive impact in bringing down 
Moutai’s first-tier wholesaler price in the distributors channel from a peak of Rmb2,700 
per bottle to Rmb2200–2300 per bottle now. In 2020, Chinese New Year will be in Jan, 
slightly earlier than last year. To satisfy high customer demand and stabilize its wholesale 
price, we expect Moutai to execute its 1Q20 supply volume ahead of schedule, possibly 
in 4Q19, which will benefit its Q419F sales growth.  
Maintain Add with an unchanged DCF-based TP of Rmb1,328  
We maintain our Add rating, because of strong earnings growth, driven by Moutai’s
channel reforms and a product mix upgrade. Moutai is currently trading at 34x FY19F, 1.7
s.d. above its historical average P/E of 19x since listing. Potential positive catalysts
including a potential ex-factory price hike in 2020, and margin improvement from the 
increase in direct sales. Downside risks include a reduction in high-end baijiu 
consumption because of the worsening economic environment.
