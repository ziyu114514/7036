SF delivered solid 3Q19 results backed by improved OPM, while adj net profit 
increased 62% YoY (55% higher than our forecast). We believe e-commerce 
parcels will continue to boost volume growth, but the accelerated ASP downward 
trend make us prudent about revenue outlook in FY19/20E. That said, we expect 
rigorous cost control to secure margins amid the heightened price war. Maintain 
BUY. We lifted FY19/20E adj EPS by 9%/2% respectively, and raised TP to 
RMB47.52 based on 36x/33x FY19/20E P/E.  
 Strong beat in 3Q19 due to Opex improvement. Adj net profit grew 62% 
YoY, 55% higher than our forecast backed by tight cost control, while 
revenue increased 26% YoY, 11% below our forecast, mainly due to larger-
than-expected ASP plump in Sep (i.e. -14% YoY). As SF will maintain 
aggressive pricing tactics in the coming “Double 11” amid intensified price 
war, we are cautious about ASP trend, but expect continued rigorous cost 
control will significantly benefit EPS growth despite GPM pressure. Hence, 
we lifted FY19/20E EPS by 9%/3%. 
 E-commerce parcels to weigh on growth outlook. In sharp contrast to 
lackluster business parcels and start-up new business, we believe share 
gains in e-commerce parcel market will continue to act as SF’s growth pillar 
in near term. We expect robust volume growth to continue in FY19/20E, but 
are concerned about ASP accelerated downward trend as ASP was down 
by 3%/7%/11% YoY in Jul/Aug/Sep respectively. Considering heated price 
war during the e-commerce carnival and afterwards, we anticipate 8% YoY 
ASP in 4Q19E, and thus lower FY19/20E revenue estimates by 2%/5%.   
 Tight cost control to secure margins. In 3Q19, the Company’s Opex 
margin ratcheted up by 1ppt QoQ/YoY thanks to strict cost management. 
Mgmt guided that SF would carry out RMB3bn cost saving plan in 2H19E, 
and we believe the continued cost cut will secure margins, given foreseeable 
GPM pressure brought by further exposure in e-commerce parcel market.    
 Maintain BUY with TP RMB47.52. In view of 1) strong volume growth, 2) 
ASP downward trend, and 3) improved operating leverage, we revised up 
our FY19-21E adj. EPS by 2-9%. Therefore, we maintained BUY rating and 
raised TP to RMB47.52, based on same 33x FY20E P/E. Key risks include 
greater-than expected ASP decline and large restricted share circulation.

Our FY19-21E EPS are 1-9% above consensus  
Considering margin expansion driven by tight cost control, we revised up FY19-21E adj 
EPS by 2-9%. Our FY19-21E adj EPS are slightly above consensus, due to our more 
positive outlook on OPM improvement.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with TP of RMB47.52 (16.1% upside) 
Our new 12-month TP of RMB47.52 is based on 33x FY20E P/E unchanged. We estimate 
35% EPS FY18-20E CAGR, due to 1) 21% revenue FY18-20E CAGR and 2) improving 
margins as a result of solid cost control.  
Key risks include 1) greater-than-expected ASP decline, and 2) large restricted share 
circulation.
