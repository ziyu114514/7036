投資概要 
前三季度業績大幅下滑 
天齊鋰業2019 年第三季度實現營收12 億元,同降18.3%，歸屬股東淨虧損5392 萬元，
扣非後淨虧損9309 萬元。前三季度累計實現營業收入37.97 億元，同比减少20.2%，
實現歸母淨利潤1.39 億元，同比减少91.7%；扣非後的歸母淨利潤1550 萬元，同比减
少99%。同時公司公布了2019 年度的業績指引，全年歸屬股東淨利潤的區間爲0.8-1.2
億元，同比减少96%-94.6%，意味著第四季度仍將錄得0.19-0.59 億元的淨虧損。 
 
鋰價下跌和資産收購帶來的財務費用重挫公司財報 
公司主要産品電池級碳酸鋰/氫氧化鋰的市場價格自2018 年以來一路下行，今年三季
度均價約爲6.6/7.5 萬元每噸，相比去年同期9.7/13.5 萬元的均價，大幅下跌了33-
44%。受此拖累，公司産品毛利率自2018 年首季創下73.7%的歷史新高後一路走低，
今年前三個季度公司毛利率水平分別爲61%/61%/53%，同比下滑12.6/10.3/11.5 個百
分點。 
 
公司斥巨資40.7 億美元收購SQM 股權産生了35 億美元的債務，長期借款由去年同期
的18.8 億飈升至282 億人民幣，淨負債率達到266%。前三個季度的財務費用高達
5.1/5/6.4 億元，單季財務費用高于2018 年全年的4.7 億元。資産收購帶來的財務費用
飈漲是公司業績重挫的主要原因。 
 
此外，收購後SQM 業績表現未達預期，令公司的投資收益逐季减少，前三季分別爲
1.39/0.94/0.77 億元。 
 
配股獲批有望减輕財務壓力 
公司配股已獲得證監會核准通過，將按照每10 股配售3 股比例向全體股東配售，計劃
募集不超過70 億元，擬全部用于償還購買SQM 股權的幷購貸款。此外公司還計劃運
用包括中短期票據、美元債和可轉債在內的多種融資方式緩解償還幷購貸款本息的壓
力，降低財務費用。若成功募集，公司的財務壓力將得到有效緩解。 
 
鋰價有望受益于供需結構好轉，觸底回升 
碳酸鋰價格目前跌破6 萬每噸，低于許多企業的成本綫，行業位于高成本産能出清的
前夜。需求方面，短期內動力電池將迎來開工旺季，中長期來看歐洲新的排放標準和
電動車補貼政策將爲原材料鋰的需求帶來支撑。總體來說，未來鋰價下行空間有限，
而上行彈性將逐漸顯現。 
作爲擁有優質資源的龍頭企業，天齊鋰業有望憑藉技術叠加規模優勢，持續受益于全
球電動化進程提速帶來的量價修復。公司奎納納一期2.4 萬噸氫氧化鋰項目預計年底
前進入連續生産和産能爬坡狀態；泰利森二期擴産已完成調試，全面啓動運營。 
 
投資建議&估值 
天齊鋰業控股了全球在産規模最大最好的鋰礦石資源，擁有目前全球規模最大的礦石
提鋰加工産能，是新能源車産業鏈上游板塊的最佳標的。我們預計公司2019/2020 年
的每股盈利分別爲0.08，0.64 元人民幣，每股淨資産爲9.73，10.67 元，目標價32 人
民幣元對應2019/2020 年3.3/3.0 倍預計市淨率，給予增持評級。(現價截至11 月7 日)
