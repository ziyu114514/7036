Hikvision | 002415 CH 
U.S. Blacklist just a short term bump 
 On the U.S. Blacklist now, but markets were warned of this a 
year ago 
 Company has actively prepared for this in order to lower the 
damage to its supply chain  
 Short term bump will not deter the rise of the world’s No.1 player 
in this field, maintain Outperform  
On the U.S. Blacklist now, but markets were warned of this a year ago. On 
Monday this week, Hikvision, together with Dahua and six other Chinese 
tech companies, were added to a US blacklist which restricts them from 
buying 
American 
products/components/software/technologies. 
We 
believe this event is not surprising to the company, its investors nor 
customers, as since the very beginning of the US-China trade dispute 
over a year ago, various political voices from the US had already said 
that tech companies including Hikvision would be added to the blacklist.  
The company has actively prepared for this in order to lower the damage 
to its supply chain. Hikvision has halted trading in the last two days and 
the company held an open conference call this afternoon to comment 
on this issue. Over the past year, the company has worked actively to 
lower their component dependence on US companies. For many 
specific components like lenses, modules and chips, they have switched 
to using domestic suppliers, while for certain generic components like 
FPGA and storage memory, they have tried their best to shift to non-US 
suppliers or developing in-house solutions. The company is also actively 
diversifying its client base into developing markets like India, Vietnam 
and the Philippines, and has lowered US client contribution to Hikvision’s 
overall revenue to a very low percentage (1-2% YTD). 
No damage to its global No.1 position, maintain Outperform. As the 
world’s No.1 player in the video surveillance camera field with a market 
share of c.30% in 2018, we believe Hikvision has the experience and 
ability to continue serving their clients and will thus continue to enjoy 
steady growth. The restriction from the US side will not knock Hikvision out 
of the field, and we believe it will instead motivate it to enhance R&D 
development and sharpen its technology, as well as enhance efforts to 
maintain its supply chain security. We believe the company’s 
fundamentals remain intact and maintain our forecast for a revenue/net 
profit CAGR of 17%/12% for 2018-2021F. We maintain our Outperform 
rating and target price of RMB36.00, still based on 25x 2020 P/E, in-line 
with its five-year average. We see any large share price correction 
following this incident to be a good entry point.
