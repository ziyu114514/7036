On 17 Oct, CITICB reported 9M19 net profit of RMB 40.8bn, up 10.7% YoY and 
accounting for 86.5%/87.4% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. In 3Q19, 
revenue saw an impressive gain of 21.3% YoY (vs 14.5% YoY in 1H19), mainly 
driven by strong net interest income (+11.2% YoY), net fee income (+37.5% 
YoY), and trading and investment gain (+55.6% YoY). Despite a 38.9% YoY 
surge in provision charges, bottom-line earnings still picked up by 12.3% YoY 
(vs 10.1% YoY in 1H19). 3Q19 annualized ROE expanded 0.11ppt YoY to 
11.7%.   
 Results positives: 1) CITICB’s loan growth remained healthy at 3.1% 
QoQ, faster than system loan growth of 2.6% QoQ and total asset growth of 
1.0% QoQ. We believe it was primarily driven by retail loans, as the Bank 
targets to lift its retail loan proportion to near 60% by 2021 (43% as of 2Q19); 
2) Asset quality was well managed. NPL formation declined 38bps QoQ to 
1.34%, and NPL ratio stayed flat at 1.72%. Provision coverage climbed 
9.7ppts QoQ to 174.8%; 3) NIM widened 2bps QoQ to 1.98%, given a 
better mix of interest-earning assets and strict control in funding cost; 4) Net 
fee income rose 37.5% YoY, likely on strong bank card and agency service 
fees; 5) Capital position improved, as CET1 CAR was up 18bps QoQ to 
8.76%. The outstanding RMB 40bn A-share CB has entered into conversion 
period since 11 Sep, and it could potentially boost CAR by 80bps with 10.2% 
EPS dilution.            
 Results negatives: 1) Deposit growth slowed to 0.4% QoQ, pushing up 
LDR by 2.6ppts to 97.7%. This was likely due to less deposit absorption 
effort under CBIRC’s clampdown on irregular structured deposits; 2) 3Q19 
opex went up 14.9% YoY, possibly on rising expenses in technology 
development.     
 Maintain BUY and RMB 6.7 TP. CITICB-A currently trades at 0.68x FY19E 
P/B, 13% below its past 5-year mean of 0.78x and 22% lower than A-share 
JSBs’ average of 0.87x. We anticipate a positive share price reaction to the 
overall solid 3Q19 results. Furthermore, we see rising incentives for 
management to accomplish a decent earnings track record in order to 
facilitate CB conversion.
