3Q19 results beat expectations; still less attractive 
than its H shares; maintain HOLD 
■ The 3Q19 results were higher than market expectations, and we are overall positive 
on the Company’s fundamentals.      
■ We fine-tuned our forecast numbers. We raised our 2019/20/21F net profit forecast by 
1.4%/1%/0.7%, respectively, and keep our Target Price of Rmb20.0 (13x 2019F P/E, 
1sd below its historical average, comparable to our H-share target multiple, which is 
also 1sd below the average). 
■ The current AH spread of ~45% is at a historical high (Figure 1), making SPH’s A 
shares less attractive than its H shares. Maintain HOLD. 
Better-than-expected 3Q recurring bottom line; good SG&A control 
and cash flow management; pressure on gross margin  
 Reported 9M19 net profit was Rmb3.399bn, up 0.8% yoy, accounting for 
77.6%/79% of our and the Street’s 2019F full-year estimates. If non-recurring items
are excluded, net profit increased by 19.6% yoy to Rmb3.07bn. On a quarterly 
basis, 3Q19 net profit (excluding non-recurring items such as fair value changes 
and impairments) was Rmb975m, up 44.8% yoy, better than expectations.     
 Overall, we note robust revenue growth for each segment, while the gross margin 
saw some slight pressure. Control of SG&A expenses was good, and finance cost 
fell 5.5% yoy in 9M19. Cash collection was also well managed, with operating cash 
flow amounting to Rmb2.93bn, up 69% yoy. Days receivable remained stable at 90 
in 9M19 (vs. 89.6 in 9M18).  
Manufacturing segment continued to show solid growth  
The manufacturing segment delivered 24.05% yoy revenue growth in 9M19 to
Rmb17.7bn; the gross margin was 57.54%, down 0.1ppt from 9M18. Strong revenue 
growth came from the fast ramp-up of 60 key products, whose sales came in at 
Rmb10.15bn, up 31.2% yoy. We believe the Company’s more stringent cost 
management of raw material procurement and manufacturing centralization largely 
mitigated gross margin pressure from drug price cuts. Going forward, we expect the 
manufacturing gross margin to gradually decline by 0.2 ppt each year (previously we 
projected a flat gross margin).  
Distribution gross margin pressure can be largely mitigated in the 
future 
The distribution segment delivered sales of Rmb122.2bn, up 18.6% yoy, and the gross 
margin was 6.4%, down 0.27 ppt from 9M18. The 3Q19 topline growth rate was 14.1% 
yoy, which was lower than 1H19’s 21% because of the consolidation of Cardinal China 
and Liaoning Pharmaceutical Foreign Trade in 1H18. We think the distribution segment’s
organic revenue growth, which came from the industry’s organic growth (high single 
digits) and SPH’s M&A (i.e. market consolidation driven by the “two-invoice system”)
remained solid. Looking ahead, despite foreseeable margin pressure from the 1) more 
stringent industry-wide medical reimbursement standards and more stringent prescription
requirements for physicians; and 2) the Group Purchase Organization (GPO), we think 
gross margin pressure can be mitigated by 1) better-than-expected Cardinal China 
synergy; 2) continuing industry consolidation under the “two-invoice system”; and 3) 
increased direct sales percentage and product mix changes.
