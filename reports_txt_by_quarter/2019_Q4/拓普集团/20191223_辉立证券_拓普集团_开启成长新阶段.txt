投資概要 
第三季度降幅收窄 
拓普集團前三季度實現營收37.66 億元人民幣，同比下降15.50%。其中，Q3 營收
13.28 億元，同比下降3.90%，環比增長11.30%，相比第二季度的下滑25%，降幅明顯
收窄。 
歸屬母公司淨利潤方面，前三季度爲3.4 億，同比下滑45%。其中第三季度1.3 億，同
比下滑30%，環比增長30%。同比去年同期，毛利率和淨利潤率分別同比下降1.55 和
3.5 個百分點，行業景氣度下行、折舊增加是主要原因。 
 
主要客戶銷量回暖帶動産能利用率環比改善 
第三季度業績好轉的主要原因在于下游客戶需求好轉。公司主要客戶吉利汽車/上汽通
用第三季度産量環比增加9.3%/3.8%，上汽自主和長安福特産量也環比改善，帶動公司
産能利用率回升，毛利率環比第二季度提高0.6 個百分點至26.4%，淨利潤率也環比提
高1.4 個百分點至9.55%。我們預計，隨著四季度主要客戶銷量進一步改善，公司盈利
能力將繼續回升，淨利潤增速有望轉正。 
 
公司在逆境繼續降本增效，第三季度銷售+管理+研發費用合計占收入比重爲14.76%，
環比第二季度减少0.92 個百分點。公司現金流良好，經營活動淨流入2.26 億。存貨同
比下降12.9%至11.4 億元。 
 
輕量化和汽車電子業務迎來發展機遇 
特斯拉的上海工廠投建進度快于預期，10 月開始試生産，年底前將完成接近2 萬輛的
産量。隨著産能逐漸爬坡，2020 年産量將達到15 萬輛，2021 年有望超過25 萬輛。拓
普爲特斯拉供貨的單車配套金額超過5000 元，預估未來兩年Model3 車型將分別爲公
司帶來9300，1.8 億元的淨利增量，約占公司2018 年淨利的12%和24%。在汽車電子
EVP 和IBS 領域，公司的前瞻布局令其在國內廠商中處于領先地位，未來有望突破國外
巨頭的技術壟斷，實現國産替代。 
公司的輕量化底盤和汽車電子業務符合行業升級趨勢，將爲公司新一輪發展注入動
能。 
 
估值與投資建議 
我們預計公司 2019/2020/2021 年淨利潤爲 5.13/7.14/9.69 億元，對應EPS 爲
0.49/0.68/0.92 元，雖然2019 年業績受壓，但特斯拉國産化加速下公司業績將迎來拐
點，幷且我們看好公司輕量化業務和汽車電子的發展前景，上調公司目標價至19 元，
對應2019 /2020/2021 年39/28/21 倍PE 估值，維持 “增持”評級。(現價截至12 月
19 日)
