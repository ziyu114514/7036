Successful channel reforms  
■ We like Luzhou Laojiao for its successful distribution channel reforms, strong 
profitability improvement and potential ASP hike for its star brand – Cellar 1573.   
■ We forecast a 27% EPS CAGR in FY18–21F, driven by a 23%/24% sales CAGR from 
its high-end and mid-range product segments, respectively.  
■ We initiate with an Add rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122 (WACC:9.6%) 
New distribution network starting to reap benefits  
Since 2015, Laojiao has taken four years to restructure its distribution network, providing 
stronger market support for its distributors and restoring its high-end brand image. Now 
Laojiao has around 3,000 distributors with over 8,000 of its own salespeople. Its brand 
value rose by 40% yoy to US$5.3bn in 2019, according to Brand Finance. Backed with 
this strong distribution network, we expect Laojiao’s channel reforms to start to bear fruit 
and its sales to grow at a 19% CAGR in FY18–21F. We also expect its high S&D
expenses ratio of 26% in 2018 to gradually fall back by 5%pts to 21% in 2021F, leading 
to OPM expansion of 8.4%pts from 34.2% in FY18 to 42.4% in FY21F.  
Product portfolio premiumization to capture consumption upgrade  
Laojiao’s product structure has been continually been upgraded. Its high-end baijiu (i.e.
Cellar 1573) sales grew rapidly by 37% yoy to Rmb6.4bn,  accounting for 50% of baijiu 
sales in FY18; while its middle-range baijiu was up by 28% yoy to Rmb3.7bn, contributing
22% of sales. Laojiao has gradually lifted its retail selling price (RSP) YTD because of
strong market demand and low channel inventory. According to JD.com, its RSP for
major products has risen by 7% to 38% YTD, and Laojiao has successfully captured the 
consumption upgrade trend.  
ASP hike could be a near-term catalyst   
Laojiao’s price strategy is closely pegged with that of Wuliangye, which successfully 
increased its ex-factory price by 12.6% through launching the 8th generation of Wuliangye 
in June 2019. We expect Laojiao to follow Wuliangye, increasing its ex-factory price of 
Cellar 1573 in the near future. Meanwhile, due to a supply shortage of premium baijiu in
the RSP range of Rmb1,000–2,000/bottle, we expect Cellar 1573 to ramp up by 7% 
volume CAGR and 15% ASP CAGR in FY18–21F.  
Initiate coverage with an Add rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122  
We initiate coverage on Laojiao with an ADD rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122
(WACC: 9.6%), implying 38x/31x FY19F/20F P/E. Laojiao is currently trading at 27x
FY19F P/E, 2.0 s.d. above its historical average of 19x since its listing in 2009. In the 
past, Laojiao’s valuation was largely in line with, or slightly below, the industry average. 
We believe that Laojiao deserves to trade at premium vs. its peers owing to a potential 
ASP hike for its super-premium Cellar 1573 products and strong sales growth 
momentum, boosted by its profit-sharing distribution model. Downside risks are as 
follows: 1) over 67% of its sales are derived from its top five customers, which indicates 
the key distributors have strong bargaining power and influence on Laojiao’s distribution 
channels, which might be a tail risk in the long term; and 2) a macroeconomic slowdown 
may affect super-premium baijiu consumption.

Successful channel reforms 
Investment summary   
Laojiao expects to be the next baiju company to tap RSP 
above Rmb1,000 per bottle after Wuliangye   
In the current new growth cycle of the China baijiu sector, starting from 2018, 
with the consumption upgrade trend, top tier brand Moutai increased its retail 
selling price (RSP) of 53°Feitian MT to Rmb2,700 per bottle from Rmb1,499 
per bottle. This has triggered strong customer demand for other baijiu products 
with a strong brand name but a more reasonable RSP in the range of 
Rmb1,000–2,000 per bottle in the super premium baijiu market. In Jun 2018, 
another top-tier baijiu brand, Wuliangye, successfully launched its new 52°
Wuliangye on the market with an RSP of Rmb1,000–1,300 per bottle, from the 
previous Rmb920–950 per bottle. Wuliangye has partially filled in the price gap 
for the RSP range of Rmb1,000–2,000 per bottle through this product upgrade. 
Wuliangye increased its ex-factory price from Rmb789/bottle to Rmb889/bottle, 
up 13%. We expect total sales volume of  52°Wuliangye to reach 18,000 
tonnes in 2019F, up 15% YoY.  
We believe Luzhou Laojiao (Laojiao) can raise its ex-factory price after 
Wuliangye’s price increase, supported by its strong brand name and sufficient 
production capacity for Cellar 1573. Currently, the ex-factory price for Laojiao 
Cellar 1573 is Rmb780/bottle, with a first-layer wholesale price of Rmb820/bottle 
and an RSP of Rmb919/bottle. We expect Laojiao’s sales to grow at a 19% 
CAGR from Rmb13bn in 2018 to Rmb22bn in 2021F, driven mainly by ASP 
improvement through product upgrades and volume growth.

Laojiao Cellar 1573 brand with strong revenue resilience  
The intrinsic value of Laojiao’s baijiu comes from its wholly-owned 10,086 aged 
cellars, 1,619 of which are more than 100 years old. The oldest ones can be 
traced back to the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty in 1573 A.D.   
To promote Luzhou’s intrinsic value in the baiju market, the company launched a 
high-end Cellar 1573 (国窖1573) product in Jan 2001. This was followed by a 
large marketing campaign to promote and strengthen its Laojiao brand among 
consumers as one of the top high-end brands.  
The strategy was quite successful, as Laojiao achieved a 23% sales CAGR in 
2000–2012, 5.8%pts higher than Wuliangye’s 17% CAGR. Laojiao also 
gradually raised its ex-factory price of Cellar 1573 from Rmb268 per bottle in 
2002 to Rmb889 per bottle in 2012; and in 2012, the RSP of Cellar 1573 
reached Rmb1,389 per bottle in the end consumer market, 25% higher than 52°
Wuliangye’s RSP of Rmb1,109 per bottle at the time. In the last baijiu growth 
cycle, we think Laojiao successfully built up its high-end brand image nationwide 
and established a solid customer base for long-term market development.  
However, in the 2013–15 baijiu sector restructuring period, Laojiao management 
misjudged the negative impact on high-end baijiu consumption of the 
government’s anti-corruption measures and implemented an inappropriate 
marketing strategy to cope with oversupply in the baijiu market; eventually 
Laojiao’s sales declined at a 16% CAGR in 2012–15; and sales volume of the 
high-end Cellar 1573 brand slumped from a peak of over 4,000 tonnes in 2012 
to a trough of about 900 tonnes in 2014.  
Since it is a popular high-end baijiu brand, Laojiao exhibited strong earnings 
recovery during the 2016–17 baijiu recovery period. After consistently adjusting 
its pricing strategy to cope with market demand and stabilizing its first-tier 
wholesale price and retail selling price, Laojiao recovered with a 23% sales 
CAGR in 2015–17, much faster than its peers; Wuliangye had a sales CAGR of 
18% and Yanghe 11%. In the new baijiu growth cycle since 2018, Laojiao 
continued its strong sales growth of 26% yoy in 2018 and 25% yoy in 1H19, 
while Wuliangye grew by 33% yoy in 2018 and 27% in 1H19; and Yanghe 
achieved sales growth of 21% yoy in 2018 and 10% yoy in 1H19.

Now the RSP of Laojiao’s high-end brand – Cellar 1573 – is about Rmb919 per 
bottle according to JD.com, much lower than its previous RSP of Rmb1,389 per 
bottle in last baijiu growth cycle in 2012. After reviewing Laojiao’s ex-factory 
price increase on Cellar 1573 since 2014, we found its pricing strategy closely 
followed that of Wuliangye. In Jun 2019, Wuliangye raised its ex-factory price of 
52°Wuliangye from Rmb789 to Rmb889 per bottle through product upgrades, 
and eventually its RSP stabilized at Rmb1,000–1,300 per bottle. We think it is 
likely for Laojiao to increase its ex-factory price by upgrading Cellar 1573 and 
closely monitoring its channel inventory, supported by its high brand recognition 
and reasonable sales volume.

Successful distribution channel reforms  
Laojiao restructured its distribution model and strengthened 
channel control  
The disadvantage of Laojiao’s region-oriented model emerged during the baijiu 
adjustment cycle in 2013–2014 because of the lack of immediate market 
information on consumer demand. Laojiao also had less power to control 
channel inventory and could not react quickly to market  demand changes. So 
when market demand fell, Laojiao unexpectedly increased the ex-factory price of 
its star product – Cellar 1573 – from Rmb889 to Rmb999 per bottle in Aug 2013 
and increased supply to its distributors. As a result, Laojiao’s products flooded 
its distribution channels and its first-tier wholesaler price and retail price fell off 
the cliff in the 2013–14 baijiu adjustment period, seriously impacting Laojiao’s 
distribution network.  
In this severe environment, the company took several measures to destock its 
high channel inventory and renew distributors’ faith in Laojiao. First, Laojiao cut 
its ex-factory price from Rmb999 to Rmb560 per bottle in Jul 2014. Second, in 
Sep 2014, Laojiao suspended supply to its distributors to give them more time to 
clear out inventory. To accelerate destocking and help channel inventory revert 
to a normal level, in Feb 2015, Laojiao implemented a cash buy-back scheme to 
buy back Cellar 1573 inventory in distributors’ hands at Rmb550 per bottle, with 
an Rmb20 incentive to further clear channel inventory and strengthen its 
distributor relationship. These moves were considered to be quite effective and 
helped build a solid foundation for Laojiao’s later rapid recovery.  
In June 2015, Laojiao formed a new management team led by Liu Miao, the 
chairman, and Lin Feng, the CEO. Both came from a marketing background with 
over two decades working experience in Laojiao’s sales team. They gradually 
restructured Laojiao’s distribution network and transformed it to a brand-oriented 
model. The layout structure looks similar to the previous region-oriented model. 
But a detailed analysis of the brand-oriented model shows that Laojiao has 
better channel control through individual brand management, and distributors 
have less autonomy, because since 2014 Laojiao has continually expanded its 
sales team from c.1,400 sales persons in 2014 to over 8,000 now, concentrating 
on product promotion and new market development.

… potential tail risk in the long term  
Laojiao helped a couple of large distributors set up three sales companies in 
charge of three different brand products: Cellar 1573, Cellar Age and Tequ. The 
shareholders of these three sales companies are large-scale distributors. 
Laojiao recruited sales people for these three sales companies to help carry out 
its sales strategies and policies. We expect these three sales companies to be 
among Liaojiao’s top five distributors.

According to Laojiao's different brands, each brand sales 
company such as Cellar1573 brand sales co. has set up. 
These companies are wholly owned by key distributors on 
the corresponding brand franchised companies, new 
distributors who can invest cash in these companies as well 
based on their previous sales revenue.
According to Laojiao's different regional markets, regional 
Qiquan sales companies were established such as Sichuan 
Qiquan sales co; Shandong Qiquan sales co. These 
companies were wholly owned by key distributors whose 
equity interest was determined based on the sales revenue 
in the previous year and sales persons who can participate

Laojiao provides operation guidance regarding on each 
brand management such as first-tier wholesaler price, retail 
selling price, supply volume etc. In some area, the 
subsidiaries of Laojiao directly take charge of individual 
products' marketing and distribution.
Laojiao standardised and supervised the operation of 
Qiquan sales companies through all kinds of contracts and 
profit allocation. Qiquan sales companies then managed 
lower-tier distributors in their individual regional markets
Deliver routes
Laojiao's wholly owned sales company delivers products to 
each brand sales company, then brand sales companies 
delivered to distributors, subsidiaries of these brand sales 
companies, then to retailers
Laojiao's wholly owned sales company delivered products 
to Qiquan sales companies, then Qiquan sales companies 
delivered to all level of distributors, then to retailers
Marketing
Laojiao self takes charge of product promotion and new 
market development. 
Qiquan sales companies were in charge of product 
promotion and market penetration . So Laojiao was less 
sensitive on market demand changes in customer ends.

Compared with Moutai and Wuliangye’s general wholesale model, and Yanghe’s 
go-to-market model, Laojiao’s model may have some potential tail risks in the 
long term. The revenue contribution from its top five customers is considerably 
higher than that of its peers, about 67% in 2018, whereas Wuliangye’s was 11%, 
and Moutai and Yanghe were both about 5%. So the bargaining power of 
Laojiao’s top five distributors is relatively strong. This might not be a big issue 
when the baijiu industry is in a growth period, since the interests of Laojiao and 
its distributors will be well aligned to seek maximum sales growth through a 
stronger brand image, market development, etc. Distributors will consistently 
follow Laojiao’s guidance on marketing strategies. However, if there is a 
downturn in the baijiu industry, the disadvantage of top five distributors’ strong 
bargaining power may become noticeable, such as unfair profit allocation 
between large and small distributors; and steps taken by large distributors in 
reaction to a sector downturn that are not in line with Laojiao’s interests.

Distributors supported Laojiao’s fast growth in the last baijiu 
growth cycle  
From 2006 to 2014, Laojiao applied a region-oriented model to encourage its 
key regional distributors and sales people to set up in their respective operating 
territories. At the time, Laojiao acted as a pure baijiu manufacturer, and all 
product promotion and market expansion responsibilities were delegated to its 
distributors. The distributors received a wide range of incentives and helped 
Laojiao grow rapidly at a 35% sales CAGR in 2006–12, the last baijiu growth 
cycle. Its high-end baijiu products were well promoted to consumers by its 
distributors, and the revenue contribution from baijiu sales improved by 12%, to 
67% in 2012 from 55% in 2006.  
 
Currently, Laojiao’s channel profit is lower than Wuliangye’s  
The retail price of Laojiao’s star product – 52°Cellar 1573 – has rebounded back 
to Rmb919 per bottle, according to JD.com, and its total channel profit is 
estimated at Rmb140 per bottle, with around a 5.1% distributor GP margin, 1.8% 
lower than Wuliangye’s 6.9%, mainly because Wuliangye successfully increased 
its ex-factory price and the overall pricing system through product upgrades.  
 
Profit-share model with distributors 
General wholesale model of China's baijiu 
industry
Go-to market model
Description
*Baijiu distributors set up their own sales companies 
based on Laojiao's guidance.
*Laojiao builds sales teams in these sales 
companies and takes charge of developing new 
markets, brand promotion, product display and 
product distribution to the end-consumer. 
* Distributor network is flattened.
* Use of wholesalers network comprising multiple 
tiers of third parties to reach target customer 
segments. 
* Wholesalers are entirely resposible for 
marketing, promotion and distribtution in their 
respective territories.
*first implemented by Yanghe.
* Yanghe develops new markets for distributors 
and takes charge of brand promotion, product 
display and other services. 
* Distributors are responsible for basic functions 
such as market management, logistics, warehouse 
and cash flow in their respective territories. 
* Front-line salespeople are managed and 
evaluated by Yanghe using the Amoeba operating 
model. 
Distributors' 
margin
* Laojiao earn fairly low margins, as it need take 
charge of marketing related expenses and sales 
team build-up in the early stage.
* Wholesalers have strong bargaining power and 
earn high channel distribution margins.
* As each party in the wholesaler pyramid model 
wants a piece of the profits, baijiu companies 
frequently offer discounts and promotions to 
retailers and consumers.
* Distributors have small bargaining power and 
earn fairly low channel distribution margins.
Advantage
* Laojiao has strong control of channel inventory 
through controlling the supply volume in each sales 
company.
* Laojiao has the ability to coordinate its sales 
interactions via production and marketing strategies. 
* Laojiao gets direct feedback from its end-
customers, enabling it to evaluate the effectiveness 
of its marketing strategy and tailor its development of 
new products to consumer interests.
* Wholesalers have sufficient cash flow and 
established local distribution networks to achieve 
rapid and extensive coverage in many cities at low 
expense. 
* The baijiu manufacturer (e.g. Yanghe) has 
access to valuable and targeted point-of-sale 
information that enables it to make intelligent 
decisions about pricing,  promotions and shelf 
space. 
*  Yanghe can easily to promote a new and small-
volume SKUs in Yanghe's own distribution 
network. 
Disadvantage
* Requires huge investment to build the distribution 
network, which can only be justified for brands with 
large scale and high profit margins. 
* Lack of assistance from local distributors at the 
early stage makes it difficult to penetrate the regional 
market, given the high barriers to entry built by local 
brands. 
* Baijiu manufacturing companies have minimal 
information about product sales, pricing and 
distribution, as it is difficult to track wholesalers' 
sales to products to retailers. Such information (on 
consumer purchasing behaviour, demographics) 
could help the baijiu manufacturers to better 
compete.  
* Baijiu companies focus on pushing products 
through the channels, which could easily cause 
wholesalers to hold too much inventory. 
* The wholesalers tend to focus on high-volume 
products and neglect new, small -volume SKUs. 
* Baijiu manufacturer must invest significant 
human resources and capital to build its own 
distribution network to reach target customers.

Margin expansion as a catalyst    
Laojiao reclassified its baijiu categories based on its brand name in 2013; all 
products under Cellar 1573 are in the premium segment, the Cellar Age and 
Tequ brands are in the mid-range segment, and the Touqu and Er Qu brands 
are in the low-end segment.     
Gross profit margin expansion driven by product portfolio 
upgrading 
We expect Laojiao’s margin expansion to come from two areas. First, we can 
see a clear product structure upgrading trend in Laojiao’s baijiu sales. Its 
premium baijiu grew at a 17% sales CAGR in 2013–18, and its sales attribution 
improved by 21%, from 28% in 2013 to 50% in 2018. Mid-range sales grew 
relative slowly at a 3% sales CAGR in 2013–18, with sales attribution declining 
from 32% in 2013 to 29% in 2018. Low-end sales fell by a 7% CAGR, with its 
contribution reduced from 40% in 2013 to 22% in 2018. We expect Laojiao’s 
product portfolio to continue its premiumization trend and for its premium baijiu 
contribution to reach 70% in 2023F, when Laojiao completes its scheduled 
capacity expansion. In 2019F–21F, we expect Laojiao’s GPM to improve by 2%, 
from 78% in 2018 to 80% in 2021F.  
Second, Laojiao started to expand its capacity in 2016. Phase One involves the 
construction of about 7,000 new cellars (around 35kt capacity) for base liquor 
and is scheduled to be completed in 2020. Phase Two is expected to be 
completed by 2025, with 100kt capacity of base liquor. According to Laojiao 
management, the new capacity will free some of the older cellars, which are 
currently used for low-end products, to produce liquor for the Cellar 1573 brand 
and Cellar Age brand. Laojiao estimates that the production capacity of Cellar 
1573 will grow to 15,000 tonnes in 2020F and 25,000t in FY25F (2018: 7,000 
tonnes).

EBITDA margin improvement driven by better control of 
expenses 
Compared with Wuliangye and Yanghe’s EBITDA margin breakdown analysis,  
Laojiao’s EBITDA margin was 35% in 2018, 11% and 12% lower than 
Wuliangye’s and Yanghe’s, respectively, mainly because Laojiao’s S&D 
expenses ratio was 26%, 17% and 15% higher than Wuliangye’s and Yanghe’s.  
In 2001, Laojiao launched its star brand – Cellar 1573 – and put a large effort 
into establishing brand awareness among consumers; therefore, its S&D 
expenses ratio immediately jumped by 6% to 23% in 2001 from 17% in 2000. 
This high S&D expenses ratio remained until Laojiao adopted its profit-sharing 
model with its distributors in 2006. Its S&D expenses ratio gradually declined to 
6% in 2012. In the baijiu adjustment period (2013–14) and baijiu recovery period 
(2015–17), Laojiao continued to dedicate a large investment to its distribution 
network reconstruction. We think Laojiao’s large-scale input in the distribution 
network reconstruction stage is largely completed. Laojiao achieved 36% 
earnings growth in 2018 and 40% earnings growth in 1H19, despite the fact that 
its S&D expenses ratio remained at relatively high level. Its distribution channel 
cost input has entered the optimization stage, as cost effectiveness and 
efficiency will gradually improve, and its S&D expenses ratio should steadily 
decline, thus improving its net profit margin. We estimate that Laojiao’s net profit 
margin will improve by 6%pts from 27% in FY18 to 33% in FY21F.

Initiate with Add rating and DCF-based TP of Rmb122   
We initiate coverage on Laojiao with an ADD rating and DCF-based TP of 
Rmb122 (WACC: 9.6%), implying 38x/31x FY19F/20F P/E. Laojiao is currently 
trading at 27x FY19F P/E, 2.0 s.d. above its historical average of 19x since its 
listing in 2009.  
We think Laojiao deserves trading at premium supported by its potential ex-
factory price hike on its super-premium Cellar1573 products, continuous mix 
upgrade and margin expansion. Since early 2019, Moutai’s retail selling price 
has remained at Rmb2000–2900 per bottle. This has led to strong customer 
demand for premium baijiu products with a strong brand name and an RSP 
range of Rmb1000–2000 per bottle. We believe Laojiao is the most suitable 
name to fit in this price range, together with Wuliangye. We expect Laojiao and 
its distributors to seize this chance to rapidly expand into the super-premium 
baijiu market.  
Meanwhile, we expect Laojiao’s profitability to significantly improve owing to 1) 
its continuous product mix premiumization; and 2) the completion of its 
distribution channel reconstruction, so there will be no need to incur large 
channel expenses for its key distributors anymore, and its brand-oriented 
distribution model will start to bear fruit. Its cost effectiveness and efficiency are 
expected to improve, reducing its S&D expenses ratio to a normal level.

Company Profile  
Oldest cellars in China   
Luzhou Laojiao (泸州老窖)positioned itself as cellar age baijiu specialist in the 
China baijiu market from the beginning. According to Laojiao’s company website, 
the older the cellar, the more the microbes multiply, the more fragrant the baijiu, 
and the higher the conversion rate of quality base liquor. According to sina.com, 
Laojiao has over 10,086 cellars, 1,619 of which are more than 100 years old. 
The oldest ones can be traced back to the Wanli Period of the Ming Dynasty in 
1573 A.D.  
Figure 23: Laojiao’s cellars with over 600 kinds of microbes

Besides its star brand – Cellar 1573 – targeting the super-premium baijiu market 
(RSP >Rmb600/bottle), in 2010, Laojiao launched another brand – Cellar Age – 
with an RSP of Rmb250–600 per bottle, depending on its production cellar age, 
which is aimed at the premium baijiu market (RSP of Rmb300–600/bottle). Sales 
of Cellar Age products reached Rmb2bn in 2018, accounting for 15% of total 
sales. 
As Figure 25 shows, there is a certain market overlap between the Cellar Age 
brand and the Tequ brand. For the mid-range baijiu consumption market (RSP 
of Rmb100–300/bottle), Laojiao does not have a distinctive brand. Its Touqu and 
Er Qu brands are obviously aimed at the low-end baijiu market (RSP 
<Rmb100/bottle). 
Sales of Laojiao’s low-end product segments declined by a 7% CAGR in 2013–
18. We think Laojiao’s current brand management strategy is to underpin its 
premium and super-premium brand recognition in less penetrated markets, such 
as eastern and southern China. Sales volume for the low-end product segment 
is expected to fall moderately with an ASP hike.

Consumption upgrades in home market with outstanding 
sales growth in the central market   
Laojiao is a famous Sichuan baijiu producer, so the southwestern market is 
considered its home market, where the Company has established a solid market 
position with wide brand recognition, contributing 38% of overall sales for 
Laojiao in 2017. Despite the southwestern market retaining flattish growth of 
Rmb4bn in sales in 2017, its gross profit margin increased by 8%pts to 79% in 
2017, higher than Laojiao’s blended gross profit margin of 72% in 2017.

Luzhou Laojiao│October 17, 2019 
Central and northern China are relatively competitive baijiu markets, with all 
kinds of high-end baijiu brands chasing market share. In 2017, Laojiao achieved 
prominent sales growth of 186% yoy in the central market to Rmb2.8bn, with a 
GPM of 72%, accounting for 27% of total sales. Northern China sales grew 
rapidly as well, at 48% yoy in 2017 to Rmb2bn, with a GPM of 71%, contributing 
19% of overall sales. With Laojiao’s continuous improvement in its distribution 
channels, we expect its sales in the central and northern markets to 
progressively expand and its profitability to improve as well.

Industry overview and outlook   
Rising sales volume to drive growth of premium baijiu market  
  
We expect sales volume of low-end baijiu to continue to decline, but sales 
volume of the premium and super premium segments to grow rapidly, driven by 
consumption upgrades and premiumization. For the premium baijiu segments, 
the first-tier wholesale price for key premium products, such as Moutai, 
Wuliangye and Cellar 1573, have risen since 2016 through either product mix 
upgrades or ex-factory price hikes. We expect rising sales volume and an ASP 
increase to be the key drivers for premium baijiu market growth in 2019F.    
Figure 30: First-tier wholesale price growth on an upward trend  
 
SOURCES: CGIS RESEARCH, COMPANY DATA, BLOOMBERG  
According to Euromonitor, the premium and super premium baijiu segments will 
expand by a sales CAGR of 7% and 11%, respectively, in 2017–21F, while the 
low-end segment will see sales contract by an 11% CAGR over the same period.

segments: 1) low-end (RSP per 500ml unit <Rmb100), 2) mid-range (Rmb100–
300), 3) premium (Rmb300–600), and 4) super premium (>Rmb600), as shown 
in Figure 33.

Premium baijiu market expected to consolidate further  
The super premium baijiu market in China is highly concentrated, dominated by 
Moutai, Wuliangye, Luzhou Laojiao and Yanghe. We estimate that Moutai had a 
market share of over 60% of the super premium baijiu segment in 2017, based 
on the revenue of these four companies. We do not believe any competitor has 
the capability to challenge Moutai’s dominant market position in the near term.  
But the premium baijiu market is more fragmented. Apart from national brands, 
certain regional brands are also popular. According to Euromonitor, sales value 
of the top five premium brands accounted for 57% of total premium baijiu sales 
in 2017. We expect the premium baijiu market to consolidate further, with 
leading players with high brand recognition, flat and wide distribution networks, 
and strong management execution ability (such as Yanghe) to gain market 
share.

share of over 60%

Three drivers for Baijiu’s long-term sales growth  
We expect the three major growth drivers of baijiu consumption in China to be: 1) 
continuous urbanization and a rising middle class; 2) an increasing proportion of 
younger consumers between 18 and 35; and 3) the expansion of online and 
offline combined channels, which will provide impetus for private consumption. 
We expect consumption upgrades and premiumization to remain dominant 
themes in the China market in the long run.

Consumption structure for baijiu has changed 
The consumption structure of China’s baijiu market has changed significantly 
since 2014, with individuals and private companies becoming more dominant, 
accounting for 45% and 50%, respectively of total baijiu sales since 2014 (2012: 
private companies comprised 28% and individuals constituted 22%), while 
government-led consumption shrank to 5% (2012: >50%). We expect individual

consumption in the premium baijiu segment to continue to rise in the long run, 
mainly because of the following: 
High net worth households driving consumption upgrades: The number of 
high net worth households with investable assets above US$1m in China 
continues to expand, and the number is expected to rise by an estimated 2016–
21F CAGR of 13% to 4m by 2021F, in tandem with investable assets growth of 
15% CAGR to Rmb111tr by 2021F, based on the Boston Consulting Group 
(BCG) research report titled “China private banking 2017”. These households 
are expected to contribute significantly to the premium and super premium baijiu 
markets, as the philosophy of “drinking less, but drinking better” has continued to 
influence the behaviour of Chinese consumers, particularly upper-middle and 
high-income consumers.  
Young consumers becoming a new driver in the consumption sector: 
Based on BCG’s estimates, the new generation of consumers aged 18 to 35 will 
contribute consumption expenditure of US$2.6tr in 2021F from US$1.5tr in 2016, 
likely surpassing the consumer group aged over 35, and will account for 
US$2.4tr in 2021F vs. US$1.9tr in 2016. We conducted a market survey of 
China’s baijiu sector in Nov 2018 with 532 participants. According to our market 
survey, the primary consumers of baijiu are between 30 and 50. However, our 
survey found that baijiu is becoming more popular with the younger generation, 
with consumers aged 20 to 30 years and those below 20 starting to drink baijiu. 
About 45% of respondents between 20 and 30 said they drink baijiu.  
Premiumisation upside from lower-tier cities: Based on McKinsey & 
Company’s estimates, by 2022F, the middle class in lower-tier cities will account 
for over 30% of China’s middle-class population, compared with 15% in 2002. 
Thus, we see high potential for upgrades in the baijiu product mix in lower-tier 
cities over the next 3–5 years.

largest baijiu consumers by sales since 2014

Luzhou Laojiao│October 17, 2019 
 
Financial review and outlook   
Ongoing product premiumization to boost margins  
In 1H19, Laojiao recorded 25% yoy sales growth to Rmb8.0bn, with net profit up 
by 40% yoy to Rmb2.8bn. These result were attributed mainly to strong sales 
growth of its premium and mid-range baijiu segments, which grew by 30% and 
35%, respectively, on a yoy basis. Its low-end baijiu segment maintained flattish  
0.7% yoy sales growth. As a result, the revenue contribution from the premium 
and mid-range segments grew 2%pts to 54%, and 2%pts to 28%, respectively; 
while the low-end segment shrank by 4%pts to 17% in 1H19.   
Because Laojiao’s product structure focused on premiumization, its GPM, 
excluding sales tax, improved by 4.8%pts to 80% in 1H19. The G&A expenses 
ratio declined by 1%, which was wholly offset the impact of S&D expenses rising 
by 0.6%pt. The net profit margin was up by 3.7%pts to 34% in 1H19.  
Figure 49: Financial review of Laojiao in 1H19  
SOURCES: CGIS RESEARCH, COMPANY DATA 
Earnings expected to grow at a 27% CAGR in 2018–21F 
We forecast that Laojiao’s sales will grow at a CAGR of 19% in 2018–21F, 
driven mainly by Laojiao’s baijiu product structure upgrading. We expect sales of  
its high-end brand – Cellar 1573 – to grow at a 23% CAGR in 2018–21F, driven 
by a 15% ASP hike and 7% volume growth. We expect sales of its mid-range 
brands – Cellar Age and Tequ – to rise by a 24% CAGR in 2018–21F, driven by 
18% volume growth and a 5% ASP hike. For its low-end brands, we expect 
sales volume to continue to shrink by a 4% CAGR and its ASP to rise by a 5% 
CAGR in 2018–21F; sales of low-end brands should retain flattish at a 1% sales 
CAGR in 2018–21F. We expect Laojiao’s gross profit margin to improve by 
2.3%pts to 79.8% in 2021F from 77.5% in 2018. 
In our view, Laojiao should have completed its distribution channel 
reconstruction over the past few years, and costs related to channel changes 
should fall accordingly. We estimate that Laojiao’s S&D expenses ratio will 
gradually decline by 5%pts from 26% in 2018 to 21% in 2021F and the operating 
leverage increase to bring down the G&A expense ratio by 1.3%pts to 4.7% in 
2021F, from 6% in 2018. We forecast that Laojiao’s net profit will go up by a 
27% CAGR in 2018–21F and that its net profit margin will increase by 6.0%pts 
to 32.7% in 2021F, from 26.7% in 2018.

SOURCES: CGIS RESEARCH, COMPANY DATA, BLOOMBERG  
 
 
Risks  
Macroeconomic slowdown: China’s baijiu consumption structure has changed 
and is now led by private companies and individuals. If the Purchasing 
Managers’ Index (PMI) deteriorates, consumer confidence could be hit, 
dampening consumption of baijiu products. Cellar 1573 is targeting the super-
premium baijiu consumption market, with an RSP above Rmb600 per 500ml unit. 
Weaker economic conditions could have a negative impact on demand.  
Government policy changes: In 2001, the Chinese government adjusted the 
consumption tax for the baijiu industry, resulting in a higher tax burden for baijiu 
companies. If the government raises the baijiu consumption tax further, demand 
for the liquor could be adversely affected. 
Board of Directors’ stability: The key members of the company’s Board of 
Directors are appointed by the government. Board stability may be shaken by 
political risk.

Strengths
Weakness
1. Strong brand recognition in nationwide. 
2. have over 6% market share in the super- premium 
baijiu market, based on our estimates.
3. The strong cash position will give Laojiao's strong 
ability to perform any large M&As and consolidate its 
market position in the baijiu industry.
1. Laojiao is controlled by government; and exposure by political 
policy such as the price hike which needs to be proved by 
government firstly. 
2. Laojiao has over 67% sales revenue derived from top five 
customers. These distributors have strong bargain power on the 
distribution channel. If the economic environment get worsen, it 
may not have sufficient incentive for distributors to follow 
Laojiao's operation guidance'
Opportunities
Threats
1. China baijiu industry are in the progress of 
consolidation on the premium segment. The market size 
of premium segment will grow at a 12% CAGR of FY17-
20F based on Euromonitor estimates. 
2. Under the strong Cellar1573 brand umbrella, we 
expect the sales growth in its Cellar Age products would 
accelerate.
1. In the consumption upgrade trend, Wuliangye has successfully 
upgraded its star product and received strong feedback from 
customer ends. Laojiao's Cellar1573 has not upgraded since it 
launched to market in 2001. Cellar1573 sales might slow down 
and  lose some market shares in the super-premium market. 
2.  China low-end baijiu market has been declining in term of 
sales volume,  we expect Laojiao's low end baijiu sales would 
shrink in volume as well.
