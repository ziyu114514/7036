Wuliangye Yibin 
Strong execution ability to drive long-term growth  
■ 3Q19 sales grew 27% yoy, with net profit up 35% yoy, both stronger than we 
expected, driven mainly by ASP and volume growth from new Wuliangye launches. 
■ Wuliangye has proven to the market that its brand image and distribution network 
have consistently improved this year.  
■ We forecast that Wuliangye will continue to deliver 18% yoy sales growth in FY20F. 
■ Maintain Add with new DCF-based TP of Rmb165. 
Successful launch of new Wuliangye led to strong 3Q19 results 
Wuliangye achieved 27% yoy sales growth to Rmb37bn in 9M19 and its net profit was up 
by 31% yoy to Rmb12bn. Of which, 3Q19 sales grew by 27% yoy to Rmb10bn with net 
profit up by 35% yoy to Rmb3.2bn, both stronger than market and our estimates. We 
believe the strong growth was mainly due to successful launch of 8th generation
Wuliangye in June 2019 which drove up both ASP and volume growth in 3Q19. We 
estimate that 20,300t of the high-end Wuliangye brand were sold 20,300t in 9M19, and 
c.5,000t of the new generation Wuliangye sold in 3Q19, 78% of our estimate for FY19F. 
As at the end of 3Q19, advance payments from customers had risen 140% yoy and 35%
qoq to Rmb 5.9bn, reflecting strong advance stocking demand from distributors to
prepare for Chinese New Year. The first-tier wholesaler price of 52°Wuliangye currently 
remains at Rmb930–940 per bottle, higher than Rmb840-850 per bottle in the beginning 
of 2019.  
Margin improvement through product structure premiumization  
The 3Q19 GPM was up by 2.7%pts to 60.4%, mainly because of product structure 
premiumization. We expect the GPM to improve by 1.5%pts yoy in FY19F. As Wuliangye 
launched a large marketing campaign for new Wuliangye products in 3Q19, the S&D
expenses ratio increased by 2.2%pts, but was partially offset by good control of G&A 
expenses. Its 3Q19 net profit margin improved by 1.8%pts to 32.2%. We forecast that 
FY19F net profit will grow by 30% yoy to Rmb17.4bn with net profit margin expansion of
1.4%pts to 34.8%.  
Sales growth expected to remain strong in FY20F  
Since 2019, Wuliangye has made clear marketing strategy to strengthen Wuliangye 
brand image and concentrate on its high-end Wuliangye brand, particular on its star 
product -52°Wuliangye.  On the other hand, Wuliangye has been outspoken to stabilize 
their distribution network and protect its distributors with a reasonable channel profit
margin to reinforce distributors’ confidence in the Wuliangye brand and the company. 
Driven by a continuous product mix upgrade and channel reform, we expect Wuliangye 
will achieve 17.8% and 16.5% yoy sales growth in FY20F and FY21F, respectively.  
Maintain Add with a higher DCF-based TP of Rmb165  
We revised up FY19F–21F EPS by 1.1%–1.7%, reflecting Wuliangye’s stronger-than-
expected sales growth and successful product structure premiumization. We maintain our 
ADD rating for Wuliangye, as the current management team has a clear strategy to
further improve the Wuliangye brand image and strong execution ability in reforming its 
distribution network. Downside risks include 1) a significant fall in Moutai’s average retail 
price, capping Wuliangye’s price increase potential; and 2) a macroeconomic slowdown,
which would have a heavy negative impact on super-premium baijiu consumption. 
Positive catalysts include 1) stronger-than-expected volume growth, and 2) better 
expense ratio control.
