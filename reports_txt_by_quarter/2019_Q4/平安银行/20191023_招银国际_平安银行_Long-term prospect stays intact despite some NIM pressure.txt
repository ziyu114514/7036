PAB reported 9M19 earnings of RMB 23.6bn, up 15.5% YoY and accounting for 
82.8%/84.0% of CMBIS/consensus full-year estimates. 3Q19 net profit picked 
up 16.0% YoY, accelerating from 15.2% YoY in 1H19. Revenue growth stayed 
robust at 19.4% YoY, driven by strong net interest income (+32.4% YoY) and 
net fee income (+63.7% YoY), while offset by lower investment gain due to 
high-base effect. The Bank boosted impairment charges (+21.8% YoY) for more 
stringent NPL recognition. As such, 9M19 annualized ROE edged up 4bps YoY 
to 12.64% despite a dilution impact from CB conversion. 
 Results positives: 1) Loan growth was healthy at 3.3% QoQ, on the back 
of faster expansion of retail loans (+4.0% QoQ) vs corporate loans (+2.4% 
QoQ). The proportion of retail loans reached 59.2% as of 3Q19. Meanwhile, 
number of retail and private banking client grew steadily by 3.8% QoQ and 
6.5% QoQ, respectively; 2) Net fee income surged 63.7% YoY, likely on 
strong fees from settlement and agency service businesses; 3) Asset 
quality remained stable. NPL ratio was flat at 1.68%, while above 90day 
overdue loan ratio fell 12bps QoQ to 1.46%, implying stricter NPL 
recognition. Credit cost rebounded to 3.2%, and provision coverage climbed 
3.7ppts to 186.2%; 4) Capital position was strengthened post CB 
conversion. CET 1 and total CAR rose 87bps/74bps QoQ to 9.75%/ 
13.36%. The Bank has proposed to issue RMB 50bn perpetual bonds, which 
could further boost Tier 1 CAR by 196bps.  
 Results negatives: 1) NIM narrowed 9bps QoQ to 2.62%, as loan yields 
retreated 19bps QoQ on possibly more prudent credit allocation, while 
funding cost was largely stable. 2) Deposit balance shrank 2.3% QoQ, 
after a decent 10.2% HoH growth in 1H19. CBIRC’s tightened regulation on 
structured deposits may restrain PAB’s deposit growth, as its proportion of 
structured deposit was 18.5% as of 2Q19.   
 Maintain BUY and raise TP to RMB 21.2. We see muted share price 
reaction after the mixed 3Q19 results. However, we remain upbeat on PAB’s 
long-term outlook given the Bank’s in-depth retail transformation and market-
oriented business strategy. We lifted our FY19-21 earnings forecast by 3-10% 
and rolled forward the valuation basis to FY20. Our new RMB 21.2 TP is 
derived from 1.35x target P/B and FY20E BVPS of RMB 15.7.
