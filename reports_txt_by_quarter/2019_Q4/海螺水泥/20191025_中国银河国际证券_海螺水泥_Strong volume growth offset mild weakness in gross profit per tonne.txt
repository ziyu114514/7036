Strong volume growth offset mild weakness in gross 
profit per tonne 
■ 3Q2019 recurring net profit grew 8% yoy, slightly better than expectations. 
■ Sales volume (ex-trading) rose about 10% yoy in 3Q, offsetting a moderate yoy 
decline in gross profit per tonne.  
■ We raise our FY19F/20F EPS by 3%/4% to reflect the stronger volume growth.  
■ We maintain our ADD rating and target price of Rmb45.40 (1.76x 2019F P/Bv).  
■ A cement price hike during the peak season in 4Q should be a major catalyst in the 
near term.  
3Q2019 results slightly exceeded market expectations   
3Q2019 recurring net profit was Rmb8,349m, up 8% yoy. Reported net profit for 9M2019 
was Rmb23.8bn (up 15% yoy), equivalent to 76% of the full-year market consensus 
forecast. As 4Q is usually the peak season of the year, the Street may revise up its
projections moderately after the results announcement.    
Overall performance remained solid  
Revenue grew 22.3% yoy in 3Q2019 to Rmb38.8bn, while gross profit rose 6.1% yoy to 
Rmb12.3bn. Revenue growth was much faster than gross profit growth because of the 
rapid growth in the trading business, which had an insignificant profit contribution. Gross 
profit per tonne for cement and clinker was about Rmb148 in 3Q2019, down Rmb7 yoy. 
The mild weakness was largely offset by sales volume growth of about 10% yoy for 
cement and clinker. This suggests the Company gained market share, as growth in the 
whole country was in the mid to high single digits.   
Cement price hike in 4Q expected to support share price  
Figures 2 and 3 show that cement prices in east China and south central China have 
picked up recently thanks to more construction activity during the peak season in 4Q. We 
are likely to see another round of price hikes in the next few weeks. The low cement 
inventory level (Figure 4 and 5)  should also offer support to cement prices in east China 
and south central China. 
Reiterate ADD  
We lift our FY19F/20F EPS by 3%/4% after making a minor upward adjustment in our 
sales volume projection and a slight increase in the gross profit per tonne forecast 
(Figure 8). We maintain our ADD rating, and our target price is unchanged at Rmb45.40 
(1.76x 2019F P/Bv). We set the target price based on a 6% discount to our H-share 
target price (the average discount in the past few years).
