Tsingtao Brewery-A 
Successful mix upgrade  
■ Tsingtao reported net profit growth of 19.8% yoy in 3Q19, in line with our expectation.  
■ We expect Tsingtao to continue its mix upgrade in FY20F to drive up its ASP and 
margins.   
■ Falling barley and paper prices will also support Tsingtao’s GPM in FY20F.  
■ We initiate coverage on Tsingtao-A with an ADD rating with a DCF-based TP of 
Rmb54. For comments on previous results, please refer to our research notes on 
Tsingtao-H. 
Strong 3Q19 earnings growth   
Tsingtao’s 9M19 sales grew 5.3% yoy to Rmb24.9bn (87% of our full-year FY19F sales 
forecast), and net profit was up by 23% yoy to Rmb2.6bn, in line with our expectations. In 
3Q19, total sales slightly declined by 1.7% yoy. The 5.9% volume decrease was partially 
offset by a 4.5% ASP increase. The volume of its core brand, Tsingtao, fell by 2.4% yoy 
in 3Q19, and the volume of its sub-brands declined by 8.9% yoy. We believe the volume 
decline in 3Q19 was mainly due to 1) clearing the channel inventory that had 
accumulated by the end of June, 2) weak sales in nightlife channels, and 3) relatively 
cooler weather the past summer, which reduced beer consumption. We expect 
Tsingtao’s channel inventory to return to the normal level in 4Q19F and forecast sales 
growth of 6.2% in FY20F.    
Successful mix upgrade expected to drive up margins 
Tsingtao’s overall ASP in 9M19 was up by 5.2%, with flattish volume growth of 0.7%, 
which was in line with China’s 9M19 beer industry output volume growth. Tsingtao 
continued its premiumization, and the volume contribution of Tsingtao, its core brand, 
was up by 1.5%pts to 49.1% in 9M19. In 3Q19, Tsingtao’s gross margin improved by 
1.8%pts yoy to 32.2% mainly due to a product mix upgrade and a VAT cut. The S&D 
expenses ratio was 16.1% in 3Q19, up by 0.8%pts, but partially offset by better control of 
G&A expenses. Its OPM improved by 2.1%pts to 14.1% in 3Q19.  
Lower raw material prices to support margins in FY20F   
The international barley price has been falling since Aug, dropping by 26% yoy in Aug–
Oct, which should benefit Tsingtao’s gross margin for 4Q19F and FY20F. The paper 
price also fell by 16% yoy in 9M19, which should reduce Tsingtao’s packaging material 
costs. We now expect Tsingtao’s gross margin to expand by 0.8%ppt and 1.1%pts yoy to 
29.7% and 30.8% in FY19F and FY20F, respectively, because of a mix upgrade and 
lower raw material prices.   
Continuing to shut down underperforming plants    
Last year, Tsingtao closed two plants: the Yangpu plant in Shanghai and the Wuhu plant 
in Anhui province. We expect Tsingtao to continue to close 1–2 plants in 4Q19F. In FY18, 
Tsingtao incurred one-off plant closure expenses of Rmb195m, and we expect similar 
plant closure expenses for FY19F. We believe the shut-down of underperforming plants 
will improve Tsingtao’s utilization rate and margins in the medium to long term. 
Initiate with Add with DCF-based TP of Rmb54   
We initiate coverage on Tsingtao-A with an Add rating and a DCF-based TP of Rmb54.
Our TP is derived by applying a 5% premium (historical average A-share premium) on 
our TP for Tsingtao-H. We like Tsingtao because of its successful product mix upgrade 
and falling raw material costs. Positive catalysts include 1) stronger volume growth in 
4Q19F and 2) better margin expansion. The risks include 1) weaker-than-expected beer 
consumption, and 2) stronger competition.
