Midea 
Signs of Improvement in 1H19 
■ Midea management is guiding high single-digit growth for 1Q19, higher than our 
previous expectation of flat to low single-digit growth. 
■ KUKA’s revenue (~10% sales) outlook is improving after a disappointing 2018. 
■ High inventory levels in the AC category (~40% sales) remain a concern for 2019.  
■ In spite of Midea’s improving near-term outlook, Midea’s shares are currently sitting 
near historical highs on a PER basis. We expect EPS growth to decelerate in 2019–
2020, and think the current valuations look stretched. We value Midea at 13x 2020 
PER and upgrade our TP from RMB46 to RMB48 after adjusting our forecast. 
2018 results in line; 2H18 gross margins a surprise to the upside 
In 2018, Midea recorded revenue of RMB261.8b, representing 8.2% YoY growth. Net 
profit grew ~17.1% YoY to RMB20.2b, in line with consensus. Revenue growth was 
substantially weighted toward H1, with H2 growth flat YoY (see Figure 1). In spite of 
slowing revenue growth, gross margins firmed in 2H18. In particular, gross margins in the 
consumer appliances segment improved 345bps HoH, driving the majority of profit 
growth in H2.  
Management upbeat on 1Q19 growth 
Management is confident that the Company outperformed its peers in sales growth for 
1Q19. Management guided high single-digit top-line growth in 1Q19 and mid-to-high top-
line growth for full-year 2019. Bottom-line growth is expected to outpace revenue 
performance. An improving growth story in 1Q19 is consistent with data from China 
Market Monitor, which shows an uptick in home appliances sales in March (see Figures
2–7) 
KUKA (~10% sales) a potential bright spot for 2019  
KUKA’s revenue declined 5% YoY in RMB terms (-6.8% in euros), mainly due to a 
slowdown in global auto sales. KUKA management cut revenue guidance twice in 2018. 
Management is more upbeat about KUKA’s 2019 outlook, with 1H19 orders expected to
be comparable with those of full-year 2018. Revenue growth for KUKA should also be 
supported by new capacity coming online at the Shunde plant. 
AC inventory levels (~40% of sales) remain a concern    
Midea’s AC inventory levels remain a healthy 4m units (down from 5m units in 3Q18).
However, total channel inventory for the sector across all brands may be approaching 
levels last seen in 2014 prior to the previous market downturn in ACs. Considering high 
channel AC inventory and a high base effect in 1H19, we remain cautious on the 
category’s 2019 growth outlook.  
Target price updated to RMB48  
We adjust our forecast to account for better-than-expected 1H19 revenue growth and 
improving margins in the Consumer Appliances segment (see Figure 10) and continue to 
value Midea at 13x 2020 PER. We increase our TP from RMB46 to RMB48 on account of 
these changes. In a scenario where new consumption policy rolls out nationally, 
increasing appliance sales by ~RMB700bn in 2019-2021, we think Midea is potentially 
worth RMB 52 per share, in line with current price level. While we continue to like Midea 
for its long-term product upgrade story and exposure to international markets, we feel 
that the recent market rally has run ahead of slowing fundamentals. Midea currently 
trades at ~14.7x consensus figures on a 1-year rolling forward basis, near the top of its 
historical range (see Figure 8). However, we forecast an EPS CAGR of ~10% through 
2020, slower than Midea’s historical high-teens EPS growth.

Key Performance Observations 
 
Midea’s revenue growth decelerated in 2H18, but management expects revenue to return to positive territory in 
2019. 
 
While KUKA is expected return to double-digit growth in 2019, the robotics segment comprises only ~10% of sales, 
limiting its impact. 
 
In 2018, AC accounted for ~50% of growth in Midea’s gross profit. With a high base in 1H19 and high reported 
channel inventory levels across the sector, we think the AC segment is unlikely to repeat this performance in 2019. 
 
Midea’s gross margins improved in every major category in 2018. Notably, gross margins for Consumer Appliances 
improved ~345bps in 2H18; we expect them to settle at ~29% in 2019–2020

Home Appliances Retail Sales by Category (2019 vs. 2018) 
 
China Market Monitor (CMM) tracks online retail sales on JD.com, Alibaba, and Suning. According to CMM, AC 
sales grew 48% YoY for the month of March 2019. YTD, online AC sales are now up nearly 30% YoY. While still 
slower than 2018’s growth of over 60%, the March data bodes well for 1Q19 and marks a shift from the slow 
January and February data. 
 
Apart from ACs, refrigerator and washing machine growth showed improvement in March, but sales remained 
relatively lacklustre.

Figure 10: Key Assumptions  
 
SOURCES: CGIS RESEARCH, COMPANY DATA
2018 results briefing takeaways 
2019 Outlook  
Management is confident that the Company outperformed its peers in sales 
growth in 1Q19. Management guided high single-digit top-line growth for 1Q19 
and mid-to-high top-line growth for full year 2019, with bottom-line growth 
expected to outpace revenue performance. 
Midea is currently executing some sales promotions before summer, but not on 
a broad strategic level. Management asserts that consumption upgrading is still 
the main trend, so profit growth should exceed revenue growth in 2019. While 
commodity prices have been increasing YTD, Midea has not been significantly 
affected by these changes. 
KUKA's results and management reshuffle 
As a result of the broad economic slowdown, especially the slowdown in auto 
sales in 2018, KUKA adjusted its revenue guidance twice last year. However, 
KUKA targets high growth in 1H19, with more than EUR 2bn worth of orders on 
hand YTD. Therefore, Midea estimates that KUKA’s 1H19 order amount will be 
comparable with that of full-year 2018, which could help KUKA achieve strong 
revenue growth in 2019, driven mainly by new available capacity in Shunde. 
Management believes the logistics, healthcare and automation business will 
make a further contribution to KUKA’s revenue growth in China. 
KUKA’s China team is now fully responsible for its operations in China. 
Previously, German headquarters made all the strategic decisions for China, but 
now operations have been optimized by delegating decision-making authority to

the China team. Midea has reportedly sent some its own managers to KUKA’s 
China team. 
Consumer appliance segment performance 
With the exception of AC/Refrigerator/WM, Consumer Appliance revenue 
declined ~1% in 2018. Kitchen hoods experienced the steepest decline (~30% 
decline) due to high inventory in the distribution channel. Microwave growth also 
declined slightly. Water heaters, water purifiers, rice cookers and induction 
cookers all maintained positive growth. Refrigerator/WM revenue increased 11–
12% in 2018. The ASP of refrigerators increased significantly, exceeding volume 
growth. 
Cash management 
Midea has a financial management company that manages its current assets, 
especially its operational cash. Structural and swap deposits, and cash and 
equivalents currently add up to ~RMB 90bn. Midea’s financial management 
company’s focus is on the safety and efficiency of Midea’s cash. The entity 
invests in bank money management products or just holds cash deposits. 
Midea’s cash normally generates a ~4% return. Midea also takes advantage of 
excess cash by acquiring companies in the supply chain, providing suppliers 
with financing, and investing in projects with KUKA. 
New product offerings  
Midea is focusing on providing a full product line and marketing it to property 
management companies. Midea’s new COLMO and BUGU brands penetrate the 
high and low tiers of the market, respectively. 
Little Swan acquisition 
The acquisition of Little Swan should be completed this June.  
Quantification of the benefits of new subsidies 
Subsidies targeting high efficiency products will definitely benefit Midea.
