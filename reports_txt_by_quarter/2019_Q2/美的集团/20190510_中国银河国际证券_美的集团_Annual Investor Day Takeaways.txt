Midea
Annual Investor Day Takeaways
■ We maintain our TP of 48 and HOLD rating on Midea 
 
Midea’s annual investor conference was, as usual, well attended, 
with over 400 attendees. The major takeaways are: 
 
Margins likely to remain stable 
Midea’s gross margin expanded by 2.4ppt YoY in 1Q19, half of which came from forex 
translation gains and half of which came from lower raw material prices. Domestic market 
gross margin increased less than 1%, suggesting its upgrade strategy has yet to yield 
meaningful results. Without meaningful margin improvement, Midea’s earnings growth in 
2019-2020E earnings growth remain lackluster. 
 
New brands 
In October 2018, Midea added the COLMO brand to its higher end product portfolio, 
joining Beverly, Toshiba and Little Swan. In April 2019, Midea launched lower end BUGU 
brand to tap into lower end market, and solidify their younger customer base. However,
we estimate limited earnings impact in 2-3 years, as Midea’s new premium brand will 
likely need time to gain market traction (i.e. Haier Casarte). 
 
No major M&A indicated in the foreseeable future 
Although Midea held ~RMB 98Bn cash as of year-end 2018 (RMB 28Bn cash + RMB 
70Bn Structured Products), Midea is not looking to take on any major acquisitions within 
the next 2-3 years. Management is focused on managing its recent KUKA and Toshiba 
acquisitions and remains cautious about taking on new ventures. Midea earns an 
estimated ~4% return on its structured deposits.  
 
Maintain HOLD until near term catalysts emerge 
We still like Midea’s long term consumption upgrade story. However, in absence of any 
near term catalyst, we retain our TP and Hold rating.
