China Merchants Shekou 
Industrial Zone 
High gross margin looks sustainable  
■ China Merchant Shekou’s (CMSK) payout ratio of 40% for FY18 was one of 
the highest among state-owned developers.  
■ Its ample low-cost land reserves in Shenzhen would enable it to sustain its 
high gross margin.  
■ We believe CMSK is a key beneficiary of the upcoming increase in weighting 
of A shares in MSCI indexes. Maintain Add with a higher TP of Rmb24.90.  
FY18 core profit a slight miss; payout ratio stood high   
CMSK’s core profit of Rmb15bn was up 23% yoy but 5% below our forecast, due to lower 
property sales booking, higher interest expense and higher minority interests (MIs). It
declared FY18 DPS of Rmb0.78, up 26% yoy. The 40% payout ratio was one of the 
highest among the state-owned developers listed in HK and China. 
Contracted sales to reach Rmb200bn in FY19F 
Following its active landbanking since FY17, CMSK’s contracted sales grew 51% in FY18 
to Rmb170bn. Management has set a sales target of Rmb200bn for FY19F (implying 
18% yoy growth), based on Rmb350bn saleable resources. We think it will have no 
problem meeting the sales target given a reasonable sell-through rate of 57%. 
Gross margin to stay high thanks to land reserve in Shenzhen 
Its gross margin (pre-LAT) stood high at 38% in FY18. Given the low cost for its ample 
land reserves in Shenzhen (in particular for its non-residential development in Qianhai, 
Shekou and Prince Bay) which we think could yield lucrative gross margins of 50% or 
more, properties sold there would lift overall gross margin. We therefore project FY19-
21F gross margin (pre-LAT) of no less than 35%. 
Huge land bank in Shenzhen to be a multi-year growth driver 
It acquired 13.6m sq m of land bank in FY18 at an average cost of Rmb7.5k psm. As of 
end-2018, CMSK had a total land bank GFA of over 53m sq m (including investment 
properties under construction), 28% of which is located in the Greater Bay Area (GBA). 
We think its huge land bank in Shenzhen, which makes CMSK stand out among its 
peers, will be a multi-year earnings growth driver. 
A key beneficiary of weight increase of A shares in MSCI indexes  
As a large-cap A-share developer, CMSK will be a key beneficiary of the upcoming 
weight increase of A shares in the MSCI indexes. We cut FY19-20F EPS by 5% to factor 
in a smoother booking schedule and higher MIs, but lift target FY19F P/E from 9.4x to 
10.8x (1 s.d. above average 12M forward P/E) on the back of improved property market 
sentiment and lift our TP accordingly to Rmb24.90. Maintain Add. Potential re-rating 
catalysts are higher-than-expected contracted sales and easing of property market 
tightening policies. Key downside risk: economic slowdown in China.
