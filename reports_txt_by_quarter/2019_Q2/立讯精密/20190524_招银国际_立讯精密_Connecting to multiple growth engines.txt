SUMMARY. We have met with Luxshare’s management recently to discuss the 
Company outlook for FY19/20E and potential opportunities for 5G era. Overall, 
we are optimistic on Luxshare’s growth strategy backed by 1) rapid product 
expansion and solid execution via strategic M&A/alliances (acoustics/haptics, 
wireless charging, optics), 2) “component-module-system” business model 
(Airpods, Apple Watch, smart speaker, BTS antenna), and 3) accelerated 
penetration into Apple supply chain (Airpod, acoustics/haptics) in FY19-20E. 
 Consumer electronics with robust growth momentum. Evolving from 
pure component supplier to module/system providers, Luxshare now offers a 
diversified product portfolio across various segments, ranging from traditional 
components (e.g. cable, connector) to more comprehensive and integrated 
modules (e.g. LCP antenna, LRA, wireless charging Rx/Tx). Meanwhile, 
Luxshare strives to broaden penetration into different Apple products (from 
Macbook/iPad, iPhone to wearables), and expand share allocation in each 
product category (e.g. acoustics, haptics, Airpods), at the expense of AAC 
(acoustics/haptics) and Goertek (acoustics/Airpods). We expect near-term 
growth drivers will come from wearables (Airpods, Apple Watch) and 
haptics/acoustics in 2019-20E. 
 Capturing 5G opportunities in 2H19E. Mgmt. believed that Luxshare is 
well-positioned to capture growing 5G opportunities with an established 
product offerings, including 1) high-speed copper and optical cables/ 
connectors for 5G network, 2) massive MIMO-compatible RF/antenna on 
small-cell base stations, and 3) LCP antenna modules in upcoming iPhones. 
Additionally, in longer term, Luxshare is eyeing on fixed wireless unleashing 
a wider scope of IoT products and routers. 
 
Valuation/Key risks. The stock now trades at 23.6x/18.1x FY19/20E P/E, 
compared to 44%/31% FY19/20E EPS growth. We believe there is further 
earnings upside for FY19-20E, on back of 1) strong growth momentum in 
consumer electronics, 2) communication interconnects benefiting from 5G 
network construction, and 3) healthy organic growth of automotive 
interconnects and potential opportunities with NEV.
