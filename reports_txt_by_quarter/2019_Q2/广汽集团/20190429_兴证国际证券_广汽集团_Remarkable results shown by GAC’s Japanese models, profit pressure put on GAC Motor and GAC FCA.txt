Comments 
Guangzhou Automobile (the company) announced its financial reports for 2018, showing a 1.13% YoY 
growth in its operating revenue at CNY 72.38 bn; its net profit attributable to shareholders (NPAS) was 
CNY 10.90 bn (+1.08% YoY); net profit without impacts of non-recurring items was CNY 9.8 bn (-4.7% 
YoY); it planned to pay a cash dividend of CNY 2.8 (pre-tax) for every 10 shares.  
For Q418, operating revenue was CNY 18.87 bn (-5.4% YoY); NPAS was CNY 1.04 bn (-42.9% YoY); net 
profit after non-recurring items was CNY 580 mn (-58.7% YoY); gross margin was 11.7% (-10.8 pcts 
YoY). 
GAC’s revenue and profit basically remained flat on YoY basis; GAC’s Japanese models delivered decent 
performance, while GAC Motor and GAC FCA operated under pressure.  
In 2018, the company sold a total of 2.15 mn units of vehicles (+7.3% YoY), of which sales volume of 
GAC Honda/ GAC Toyota/ GAC MITSUBISHI MOTORS/GAC Motor/ GAC FCA was 741,000 (+5.2% 
YoY)/580,000 (+31.1% YoY)/144,000 (+22.7% YoY)/535,000 (+5.2% YoY)/125,000 (-39.0% YoY). The 
company’s 2018 NPAS basically stayed the same on YoY basis, coming in at CNY 10.9 bn. Among that, 
1) investment income settled at CNY 9.0 bn (+8.1% YoY), which we estimate was mainly contributed 
by GAC Honda and GAC Toyota and slightly driven by GAC MITSUBISHI MOTORS but dragged down by 
GAC FCA; 2) GAC’s results of “NPAS minus investment income” declined by 22.8% YoY to CNY 1.9 bn, 
mainly due to a YoY decrease in earnings caused by strengthening promotion of GAC Motor’s models. 
The company incurred a sharp decline in its NPAS of Q418, resulting from more pressure on GAC Motor 
and a larger YoY decrease in GAC FCA.  
In Q418, operating revenue declined by 5.4% YoY to CNY 18.87 bn and gross margin fell by 10.9 pcts 
to 11.7%, mainly due to: 1) intensified promotion of major models such (as GS4 and GS8); 2) rebates 
recorded into costs instead of sales expenses according to new accounting standards. Net investment 
income in Q418 dropped by 9.6% YoY to CNY 1.33 bn, which was triggered by large losses on GAC 
FCA. GAC FCA sold a total of 15,000 units of vehicles, down by 43% YoY. 
Earnings forecast and investment recommendation: we expect GCA’s Japanese models to remain strong

sales and expect GAC Motor and GAC FCA to achieve marginal improvement.  
The company plans to realize a sales growth of 8% for 2019, which we estimate the incremental sales 
shall be driven by GAC Motor and the joint ventures with Japan’s auto manufacturers.  
The company’s Japanese models are expected to continue showing outstanding results, such as 
brand-new HR-V and Odyssey Hybrid of GCA Honda, a new generation of GAC Toyota Levin and Levin 
PHEV.  
GAC Motor may embrace a marginal improvement through the launch of new model GM6, a new 
generation of GA6, the brand-new GS8 and a new generation of GS4.  
GAC FCA may rely on the brand-new Cherokee and Grand Commander launched in H118 to 
contribute to the company’s growth for 2019.  
Based on the latest situation, we revised the estimated NPAS to CNY 10.93/12.84 bn for year 19/20 
and expect the NPAS to be CNY 14.78 bn for 2021. We maintain “Buy” rating for the company. 
Potential risks: a sharp decline in the industry’s growth rate; a further decrease in GAC Motor; more 
losses on GAC FCA
