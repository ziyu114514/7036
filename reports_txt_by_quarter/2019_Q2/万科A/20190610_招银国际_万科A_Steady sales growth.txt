SUMMARY. We initiate coverage with a BUY recommendation on Vanke – A share. 
Vanke is a pioneer in China property market, in terms of leasing apartment, 
prefabricated construction and etc. We set TP as RMB31.68, which is equivalent to 
past five years average forward P/E of 9.0x. Upside potential is 16.8%. 
 
Share placement strengthened balance sheet. Vanke underwent shares 
placement and completed in Apr 2019. The Company issued and sold 263mn 
new H shares at price of HK$29.68 per share. The newly issued H shares 
represented 16.67% and 2.33% of the enlarged total issued H shares and total 
issued share capital, respectively. Net proceeds of this H shares placement was 
HK$7.78bn and used for debt repayment. New capital can flourish the balance 
sheet although net gearing of Vanke was low at 30.9% as at Dec 2018. 
 
Bottom line surged 25% in 1Q19. In 1Q19, revenue and net profit surged by 
59.4% to RMB48.4bn and 25.2% to RMB1.12bn, respectively. The slower growth 
in bottom line was due to the scale effect. Delivered GFA climbed 88.2% to 
3.11mn sq m in 1Q19 but only represented 10.5% of our forecast full year 
delivered GFA. On the other hand, other fixed cost including SG&A expenses and 
interest expenses would not change following to the scale of delivered GFA. As 
at May 2019, pre-sold but unbooked properties amounted to RMB704.6bn or 
47.79mn sq m that provided good earnings visibility in the coming year. 
 
Contracted sales grew by 12% in 5M19. Contracted sales amount and area 
surged by 12.0% to RMB267.6bn and 4.7% to 16.61mn sq m in 5M19, 
respectively. It seems Vanke’s growth was slower than most peers but it 
was still the fastest among BIG 3, followed by Country Garden (2007 HK) 
and Evergrande (3333 HK). 
 
Attributable land bank amounted to 92.45mn sq m. Vanke acquired 19 new 
projects with attributable land bank of 5.99mn sq m in 1Q19. As at Mar 2019, total 
and attributable land bank amounted to 153mn sq m and 92.45mn sq m, 
respectively. Moreover, Vanke participated in several urban redevelopment 
projects with aggregate attributable GFA of 3.48mn sq m. Current land bank is 
sufficient for next three years’ development. 
 
Initiate with BUY recommendation. Vanke is a pioneer in China property market, 
in terms of leasing apartment, prefabricated construction and etc. We set TP as 
RMB31.68, which is equivalent to past five years average forward P/E of 9.0x. 
Upside potential is 16.8%.
