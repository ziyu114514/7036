Gree 
Inventory Overhang Weighs on 1Q19 Results 
■ 1Q19 revenue slowed to 2.5% YoY vs. 32% growth in 4Q18. The slowdown was due 
to high channel inventory levels and seasonality.  
■ Investments in new ventures are beginning to impact Gree’s OPEX line and may 
weigh on the Company’s earnings growth. 
■ The payout ratio reduction indicates Gree is preserving cash, possibly for M&A. 
■ Its valuation remains at a historical high on expectations of a Zhuhai government sell-
down, but visibility on the end buyer(s) remains unclear. 
■ Gree’s high channel inventory, slower EPS growth and historically high valuation 
make us cautious on the stock. We roll forward our forecast to 2020 and update our 
TP from RMB40 to RMB44, downgrading to SELL on valuation grounds. We continue 
to value Gree at 9.5x 2020 PER. 
2018 results in line, revenue growth stalls in 1Q19  
While Gree’s 2018 results were in line with street expectations, we think 1Q19 revenue 
growth was a surprise to the downside. Gree’s revenue slowed to 2.5% YoY in 1Q19 vs. 
32% growth in 4Q18. We think the slowdown was mostly on account of high channel 
inventory levels following channel stuffing during 2H18, though seasonality may have 
also played a role. CMM data (Figures 2-7) shows retail sales for air conditioning picking 
up in March, so we expect 2Q19 to show some improvement moving into the peak 
season. For 2019, Gree believes low double-digit growth is achievable. However, we 
think the high base in 2018 and high channel inventory levels are likely to continue 
weighing on Gree’s sales, and think mid-single digit growth is more likely. 
R&D and selling expenses to weigh on earnings growth 
Gree is aware that its single market, single product focus limits the Company’s growth 
potential. Therefore, the company is trying to diversify into new business areas in small 
appliances, smart equipment, and semi-conductors. Gree’s R&D spending, for example, 
increased from 2.4% to 3.5% of sales between 2017 and 2018. As Gree continues to 
invest in new product lines, we think increased selling expense may also pressure the 
Company’s bottom line. Selling expenses have fallen in recent years from ~15% of sales 
in 2015-16 to just 9.4% of sales in 2018. But with Gree investing in new product 
development and diversifying its revenue mix, we think increasing sales and R&D 
expenses may pressure its bottom line. 
Payout ratio reduced to ~48%  
Historically, Gree has maintained a ~70% payout ratio. This year’s reduction to ~50% 
suggests the Company is withholding cash for M&A activity, despite cash reserves of
~RMB113Bn.  
Stretched valuation  
Gree has been re-rated in recent weeks on news that the Zhuhai government is looking 
to dispose of its 18% stake in the Company, which would lead to improved corporate 
decision making and better management incentives. However, visibility on the buyer(s)
remains low, and we think that current valuation at ~12x rolling forward consensus is
unlikely to continue (Figures 8-9). We remain cautious about Gree’s future growth in light 
of high channel inventory, the lack of new discernible long-term growth drivers, and an 
inconsistent corporate strategy. Gree derives ~88% of its revenue from China, making its 
earnings almost wholly reliant on the domestic China market. On this basis, we believe 
Gree warrants a discount relative to its peers Haier and Midea. We raise our 2019-2020
EPS estimates by 3% and 4% on a slightly improving revenue outlook and roll forward 
our TP to 2020. We value the Company at 9.5x 2020E PER, implying a target price of 
RMB44, or ~21% downside. In the event of a home appliance stimulus roll-out in 2H19, 
we think Gree’s shares are potentially worth RMB47 per share, or 15% downside.
