Guoxuan High-Tech 
2018 results delayed – Management cut earlier profit 
estimates by more than 30% 
■ Guoxuan High-Tech made two announcements on 24 April, indicating 1) a >30% cut 
in previous 2018 earnings guidance, and 2) a delay in its 2018 and Q1 2019 results 
release from 26 to 30 April.  
■ The earnings guidance cut and the delay in the results release reinforces our cautious 
view on Guoxuan High-Tech’s earnings growth recovery outlook for 2019–2020.   
■ We will revise our numbers after it releases more detailed results on 30 April. We 
currently have a SELL rating on Guoxuan High-Tech. As a smaller player, the 
Company should have more difficulty surviving under future competition with domestic 
leaders like CATL, as well as foreign competitors. We think a poor earnings growth 
recovery outlook will put its share price under pressure in 2019.   
Surprising cut to 2018 earnings 
Guoxuan High-Tech made two announcements on 24 April, indicating 1) a >30% cut in
previous 2018 earnings guidance, and 2) a delay in its 2018 and Q1 2019 results release
from 26 to 30 April. The downward revision in its 2018 earnings guidance reflects 1) its
more conservative recognition of revenue and costs incurred with counterparties like
Ankai Bus, and 2) additional asset impairment made on doubtful accounts receivable.
The revised guidance includes a 16.8% cut in its 2018 revenue guidance and a 31.9%
cut in its 2018 net profit guidance (Fig 1). The downward revision in its 2018 earnings
guidance suggests there will be downside revision to consensus earnings estimates for
the Company in 2018–2020E. We will adjust our earnings forecast for the Company for
2019–2020E after it releases its 2018 and Q1 2019 results on 30 April. 
Disappointing results confirmed our negative view 
The earnings guidance cut reinforces our cautious view on Guoxuan High-Tech’s
earnings growth recovery outlook for 2019–2020. Even with additional capacity
increases, the Company had difficulty achieving its earnings growth recovery in 2018
against market expectations. With further subsidy cuts, we expect China’s NEV demand
growth visibility to remain low in 2019–2020. Even with a positive demand growth, the
subsidy cuts will put further pressure on ASP and margins. Guoxuan High-Tech doesn’t
have the same technology and cost competitiveness as domestic leader CATL, which
puts it in a dangerous position when facing more intensified competition resulting from
the massive government subsidy cut. With a downward revision in its 2018 earnings, we
think its 2019 earnings growth visibility will also worsen.  
Smaller players to face more competitive difficulties 
As we highlighted in our initiation report published on 17 April, Guoxuan High-Tech is a
smaller player compared to industry leaders like CATL and other Japanese and Korean
companies. Its products are concentrated in the lower end of the NEV battery industry.
As a 2nd tier industry player, the Company should face more challenges meeting
demand from major OEMs for technology development and cost reductions. Without any
firm bonds with major OEMs, we expect Guoxuan High-Tech to lose market share in
China and to have greater difficulty growing into a global player in the long term.  
Maintain SELL 
We have a SELL rating on Guoxuan High-Tech with a target price (TP) of Rmb11.00. Our
TP is based on a target 2019E PER multiple of 13x (1.3x PEG). The poor earnings
growth recovery outlook should put its share price under pressure in 2019. We will adjust
our TP after we revise our numbers after the release of its 2018 and Q1 2019 results.
