Guoxuan High-Tech 
Remain cautious  
■ We update our earnings forecast for Guoxuan High-Tech in 2019–2020.  
■ Guoxuan High-Tech’s earnings miss in 2018 was in line with our cautious view on the 
Company’s core power battery business growth outlook. Earnings growth recovered in 
Q1 2019, but margin contraction remained a major concern for its earnings growth 
recovery potential in 2019–2020E.  
■ We think further government subsidy cuts will put more pressure on China’s power 
battery demand growth in 2019–2020. In addition, as a smaller player, it should face 
more pressure on its ASP and margins. Accordingly, we cut our earnings forecast for 
the Company for 2019–2020E by 20–30%.  
■ We maintain our SELL rating on Guoxuan High-Tech and cut our target price (TP) by 
29% to Rmb7.80 (13x 2019E PER). Our TP is derived from our lower earnings 
forecast for the Company in 2019–2020E.   
2018 results a big miss; Q1 2019 earnings growth recovered but 
margin contraction remains a big concern 
Guoxuan’s total revenue in 2018 grew only 6.0% YoY, 16.6% below its revenue
guidance. With bigger margin contraction and additional asset impairment for doubtful
accounts receivable, its net profit continued to fall 30.8% YoY in 2018 to
RMB580m, >30% below its 2018 earnings guidance. Its revenue growth in Q1 2019
accelerated to 65.3% YoY,  driven mainly by its core NEV battery segment, as OEMs are
pushing NEV sales before the new subsidy policy takes effect on 26 June. But its gross
profit margin contracted by 2.8ppt YoY to 30.0% in Q1 2019. There were some SG&A
cost savings. But rising financing costs and a higher effective tax rate led to net profit
growth of only 25.2% YoY in Q1 2019.   
Low earnings growth visibility due to NEV demand growth 
uncertainty and margin pressure from further ASP cuts 
With further subsidy cuts, we expect China’s NEV demand growth visibility to remain low
in 2019–2020. Although NEV battery sales volume in Q1 2019 grew 182.6% YoY in
China, this was mainly due to OEMs boosting sales before the new subsidy policy takes
effect. In addition, the subsidy cuts will put further pressure on ASP and margins for
power battery producers. Guoxuan High-Tech doesn’t have the same technology and
cost competitiveness as domestic leader CATL, which puts it in a more dangerous 
position when facing intensified competition resulting from the massive government
subsidy cut. Therefore, we cut our revenue forecast for the Company in 2019E by 14.2% 
and maintain our revenue forecast for the Company in 2020E. Considering further 
downward pressure on margins, we cut our earnings forecast for the Company in 2019
and 2020E by 33.7% and 24.4%, respectively. Overall, we expect its earnings to grow
6.9% and 23.8% YoY in 2019 and 2020E, respectively.  
Rising accounts receivable a red flag 
Accounts receivables at the end of 2018 represented 123% of its total revenue in 2018 
vs. 91% at the end of 2017 and 57% at the end of 2016. Accounts receivable turnover
days also lengthened to 382 days in 2018 from 268 days in 2017 and 175 days in 2016.
Operating cash flow remained negative in 2016 and 2017. Operating cash outflow rose
from Rmb100m in 2017 to Rmb1,559m in 2018. Although operating cash flow in Q1 2019
showed signs of improvement, the full-year operating cash flow situation still remains
wait-and-see.  
Maintain SELL  
We maintain SELL on Guoxuan High-Tech, and cut our target price (TP) from Rmb11.00
to Rmb7.80, based on the same target 2019E PER multiple of 13x. The TP cut is derived
mainly from our lower earnings estimates for 2019–2020.
