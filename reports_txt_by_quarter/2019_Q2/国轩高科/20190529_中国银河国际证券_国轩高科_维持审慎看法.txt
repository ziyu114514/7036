国轩高科 
维持审慎看法  
■ 我们更新了公司2019 - 2020 年的盈利预测。 
■ 国轩高科2018 年盈利逊于公司最初指引，和我们对公司核心动力电池业务增长前景的
谨慎看法一致。公司盈利增长在2019 年一季度有所回升，但毛利率下滑仍是2019 - 2020
年盈利增长复苏的主要担忧。 
■ 我们认为，政府进一步削减补贴将对2019 - 2020 年中国动力电池需求增长构成更大压
力。此外，相比宁德时代公司业务规模教小，国轩高科应会面临更大的产品售价和利润
率下滑压力。因此，我们将公司2019-2020 年的盈利预测下调20-30％。 
■ 我们维持「沽出」评级，并将目标价下调29％至人民币7.80 元（13 倍2019 年市盈率）。
新的目标价是基于我们下调了2019 - 2020 年盈利预测所得出。 
2018 年业绩大逊预期；2019 年一季度盈利增长复苏，但毛利率收缩仍构
成大问题 
国轩高科2018 年收入同比仅增长6.0％，较收入指引低16.6％。由于利润率跌幅扩大，加
上应收账款额外追加的资产减值，公司2018 年净利同比继续下降30.8％至人民币5.8 亿元，
较原先2018 年盈利指引低超过30％。由于OEM 厂商于6 月26 日新补贴政策生效前加快
新能源汽车销售，这推动了国轩高科核心新能源汽车电池业务一季度的快速增长，一季度公
司收入同比增长加快至65.3％。但公司一季度毛利率同比下降2.8 个百分点至30.0％。公
司节省了部分行政及销售成本。但是，由于融资成本不断增加和有效税率上升，公司一季度
净利同比仅增长25.2％。 
新能源汽车需求增长具不确定性 迭加进一步降价带来利润压力，盈利增
长可见度仍然低 
随着政府进一步削减补贴，我们预计2019 - 2020 年中国的新能源汽车需求增长可见度将偏
低。虽然一季度新能源汽车电池销量同比增长182.6％，但这主要是由于OEM 厂商在新补
贴政策生效前加快销售所致。此外，补贴削减将对动力电池生产商的平均售价和毛利率构成
进一步压力。国轩高科与国内领先的宁德时代相比不具备相同的技术和成本竞争力，当面临
政府大规模削减补贴及竞争变得激烈时，国轩高科将处于较危险的境地。因此，我们将公司
2019 年收入预测下调14.2％，只维持公司2020 年收入预测。考虑到利润率承受更大压力，
我们将2019 年和2020 年公司盈利预测分别下调33.7％和24.4％。总体而言，我们预计
2019 年和2020 年的盈利分别同比增长6.9％和23.8％。 
应收账款上涨也需格外注意 
2018 年底，公司应收账款占2018 年总收入123％，2017 年底这个比重为91％，2016 年
底这个比重为57％。应收账款周转天数也从2017 年的268 天增加至2018 年的382 天，
2016 年为175 天。2016 年和2017 年的经营现金流量仍然为负。经营现金流出从2017 年
的人民币1 亿元增加至2018 年的人民币15.59 亿元。虽然2019 年一季度经营现金流显示
出改善迹象，但对于全年经营现金流量情况，我们仍需观望。 
维持沽出评级 
我们维持对国轩高科技的沽出评级，并将目标价从人民币11.00 元下调至人民币7.80 元， 
2019 年目标市盈率维持13 倍不变。降低目标价主要是由于下调了2019 - 2020 年的盈利预
测所致。
