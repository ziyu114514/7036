SUMMARY. We attended CEB’s reverse road show in Shanghai, with recent 
operating results, wealth management business, and technology development 
strategy as main themes. Cloud Payment, the Bank’s key digitalization initiative, 
offers a great boost to client base growth and potential earnings, in our view. 
 The largest open-ended payment platform in China. Retail business and 
technology utilization are crucial for CEB’s strategic goal of “building a first-
class wealth management bank”. Cloud Payment (云缴费) is one of the Bank’s 
initiatives to carry out inclusive finance and explore the utilization of financial 
technology. The number of user and transaction amount saw an explosive 
growth in the past years, reaching 253mn and RMB 206bn, respectively, in 
2018, making it the largest open-ended payment platform in China. 
 Contribution to fee/deposit/customer base. Cloud Payment’s major 
contribution to CEB are threefold: 1) Fee income, including agency and 
platform access fee, was RMB 160mn (up 159% YoY) in 2018 and expected 
to reach RMB 300mn in 2019; 2) Deposit inflow from payment receiving 
institutions, as they have to set up account in CEB for settlement and clearing 
purpose; 3) Collection of massive user data and conversion of users into 
customers of the Bank. 
 Other questions/concerns from investors. 1) CEB’s wealth management 
business transformation is ahead of peers, in terms of product design and 
brand building. It targets to be the first JSB to get approval for operation of 
WM subsidiary; 2) Credit card business remains a strategic focus, but growth 
will moderate due to proactive risk control, e.g. restricting the usage of credit 
card overdraft and adjusting client mix; 3) Despite stricter NPL recognition and 
faster disposal in 2018, management was cautious on 2019 outlook. 
Classifying >60-day overdue loans to NPLs may result in some asset quality 
pressure; 4) NIM trend should be largely stable in 2019. Asset yields may 
further decline, and deposit cost hike will be eased by scrutiny on irregular 
deposit absorption; 5) Management was confident that the RMB 30bn CB 
issued in 2017 would be converted to equity in foreseeable future.    
 Initiate CEB-A with BUY rating and RMB 4.50 TP. CEB-A trades at 0.65x 
FY19E P/B, 11% below historical mean of 0.73x and 14% below A-share 
banks’ average of 0.76x. Our TP of RMB 4.50 is based on GGM-derived target 
P/B of 0.75x and 2019E BPS of RMB 5.98.

Key points of concern from investors 
Wealth management business  
CEB started to implement the strategy of “building a first-class wealth management bank” 
in 2018. Wealth management is also one of the six E-SBU (Ecosphere Strategic Business 
Unit) of China Everbright Group. It is difficult for JSBs to beat large SOE banks in product 
scale, therefore they tend to stay on the forefront of product innovation. In early-2018, CEB 
launched its net-value product series “Sunshine” (七彩阳光净值型产品), which complies 
with PBoC’s new asset management rule. CEB was one of the first two JSBs to receive 
CBIRC’s approval on establishing wealth management subsidiary, and the Bank targets to 
be the first JSB to get regulatory permission on business operation.     
Credit card business  
Credit card business has been CEB’s strategic focus and contributed to over 30% of the 
Bank’s revenue in the past years. After rapid expansion in 2016-2018, credit card business 
will moderate and maintain a steady growth pace. Looking forward, the Bank will carry out 
following measures: 1) restricting the purpose of credit card overdraft to consumption 
instead of cash loans; 2) adjusting client mix to 80s and 90s and improving product design 
correspondingly; 3) strengthening cooperation with technology companies, such as Xiaomi 
and JD finance.  
Asset qualty outlook  
Although CEB had proactively improved recognition and disposal of NPLs in 2018, 
management remained cautious on asset quality outlook in 2019. They see new NPLs 
mainly from overcapacity corporate sectors, such as manufacturing and wholesale & retail, 
which together contributed to 27% of total corporate loans, but 57% of corporate NPLs. 
Classifying above 60-day overdue loans to NPLs may add some pressure. That said, 
management was confident to keep overall asset quality risk under control.  
NIM outlook  
NIM trend is likely to remain largely stable on quarterly basis in 2019. Asset yields may 
further decline, but would be mitigated by optimized loan mix, i.e. higher proportion of retail 
loans. On the flip side, there is limited downside in funding cost, but deposit cost will be 
controlled with regulatory scrutiny on issuance of structured deposit and certificate of 
deposit.     
Convertible bond  
CB is favored by capital market and encouraged by CSRC. It is also cost efficient for banks, 
as average coupon rate was only 0.5% for CEB’s RMB 30bn CB issued in 2017. 
Management was confident that the CB would convert to equity, as stellar financial 
performance would gradually boost the Bank’s valuation. Management also mentioned to 
improve market recognition through more frequent investor communications.
