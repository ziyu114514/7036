SUMMARY. We have met with LONGi’s management recently to discuss the 
Company and solar sector outlook in FY19/20E. Overall, we are optimistic on 
LONGi’s expansion strategy backed by 1) stably increasing mono-PERC product 
demand from the overseas market, 2) cost leadership led by advanced mono-Si 
growing and diamond wire saw technology combo, and 3) demand recovery in 
China market which will likely boost ASP in 2H19E.  
 World’s largest mono-crystalline product manufacturer. LONGi has more 
than 19 years’ experience specialized in producing mono-Si solar wafer, cells 
and high-efficient modules. The Company is now the largest mono-crystalline 
product supplier in the world. Mgmt. believed mono-PERC product is the most 
suitable high-efficient PV product offering high photoelectric conversion 
potential in the grid-parity era. By 1Q19, LONGi mono-cell products offered 
up to 22%+ efficiency during mass production, leading PV peers in China.  
 Technology advancement and cost leadership build the key edges. 
LONGi was the first to achieve a breakthrough adopting diamond wire saw 
cutting for mono-Si rod. Together with unique mono-Si growing technologies 
supported by localized equipment, LONGi had successfully built up cost 
leadership in mono-wafer production, which kicked off a trend in replacing 
multi-wafer and meeting high-efficient PV module demand since 2017. LONGi 
recorded 1Q19 GPM of 23.5%, and mgmt. expected GPM to further improve 
with lower Poly-Si costs and cost reduction measures in 2Q19E.   
 Market potential and expansion strategies. LONGi placed key module sales 
focus on the overseas market, in view of short-term policy uncertainties in 
China. Mgmt. expected global PV installation to reach 120GW in 2019, and 
shared optimistic market outlook in Europe, after EU ends anti-dumping and 
anti-subsidy measures. To capture future growth, LONGi targets to expand 
mono-wafer capacity to 65GW by end-2021, representing FY18-21E capacity 
CAGR of 32.4%. 
 Valuation is still attractive on long term growth prospects. Trading at 
21.1x/16.6x FY19/20E P/E, LONGi has no significant valuation premium 
comparing to peers. Given its leading market position as well as rapid capacity 
expansion with profitable margin, we believe there is still upside on both 
earnings and valuation.
