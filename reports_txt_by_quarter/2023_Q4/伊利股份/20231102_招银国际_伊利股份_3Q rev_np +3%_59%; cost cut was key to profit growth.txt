Yili Industrial (600887 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q rev/np +3%/59%; cost cut was key to profit growth  
 
Yili’s 3Q revenue/net profit stood at RMB31.2/3.1bn, up +2.7%/59.5%, and both 
came in in line with our estimates. The former was largely driven by a sequential 
acceleration in liquid milk sales to +8.5% YoY (from -2.6%/+0.5% in 1Q/2Q) that 
offset a rather disappointing momentum in low-temp/IMF sales (-35.7%/-3.9% 
YoY). Meanwhile, the latter grew off a low comps with a 1.6pp expansion in 
GPM, along with a notable 1.6pp decline in opex ratio which we previously 
asserted it to be a major earnings growth driver. Management has guided down 
full-year sales growth target to MSD% (from low-teen), and we believe this 
would not come in as a total surprise to the market, given consensus growth has 
already trimmed down to HSD% since 1H results. Separately, management also 
sounded realistically positive on 4Q and even on 2024E outlook with an 
actionable roadmap to gain market share in each segment. We remain Buyer of 
Yili.  
 Outlook by segment. Management expects single-digit growth in liquid-
milk for 2023, considering the timing difference between 2023 and 2024 
CNY that impacts the timing of restocking among distributors. The premium 
Satine brand should keep its double-digit sales growth and further 
accelerate in 2024. IMF should deliver QoQ improvement as new products 
introduced since August were well-received. Considering also the exit of 
small players amid industry consolidation, October sales have already 
returned to positive growth. The adult milk formula has fared well. Low-
temp business dipped in 3Q due to seasonality and a lower-than-expected 
temperature nationwide. That said, given the segment’s insignificant 
contribution over 2H, management still sees double-digit growth potential 
for the full year.  
 Earnings change. We slightly trim our 2023E revenue by 2.9%, driven by 
a 7.8% cut in IMF sales, followed by a 6.7%/0.5% cut in low-temp dairy and 
liquid milk sales. Separately, we raise our GPM by 0.2pp to reflect an easing 
input cost pressure, and this should partially offset the impact of a slower 
top-line growth. Our net profit estimate is 1.5% lower. 
 Valuation. Our revise TP to RMB34.5 (from previously RMB36.5) based on 
an updated 20.5x (from previously 21.0x) roll-forwarded mid-24E P/E, which 
still benchmarks to -1sd below average. We value both Mengniu (2319 HK, 
BUY), Yili (600887 CH, BUY) and Feihe (6186 HK, HOLD) at -1sd below 
average, in view of lukewarm dairy demand, especially that for IMF, amid a 
faltering consumption recovery.
