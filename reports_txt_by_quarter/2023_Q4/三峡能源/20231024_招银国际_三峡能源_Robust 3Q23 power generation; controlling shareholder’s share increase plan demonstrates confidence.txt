CTGR Group (600905 CH) 
 
 
 
Robust 3Q23 power generation; controlling shareholder’s 
share increase plan demonstrates confidence 
 
CTGR reported a 10.31% YoY increase in 3Q23 electricity generation, with 
wind and solar power showing robust growth. Cumulatively, from 1Q23 to 
3Q23, the company’s electricity generation grew by 13.36% YoY to 40.03bn 
kWh. We remain optimistic about CTGR’s full-year power generation. 
Additionally, CTG, the controlling shareholder of CTGR, plans to increase its 
stake in next 12 months, demonstrating confidence in CTGR's future business 
extension. For 2023, CTGR aims to achieve no less than renewable energy 
capacity installed, and we believe CTGR can achieve its target supported by 
abundant project resources and lower upstream cost. We maintain our BUY 
rating and target price of HK$6.24. 
 CTGR announced resilient 3Q electricity generation growth and we 
maintain our full-year generation estimates unchanged. CTGR's 3Q 
electricity generation reached 11.94bn kWh, a 10.31% YoY increase. Wind 
power generation rose by 10.04%YoY (onshore/offshore wind power by 
9.47%/11.41% YoY) to 7.40bn kWh, while solar power increased by 
11.82% YoY to 4.16bn kWh. Hydropower declined by 1.63% YoY, but 
independent energy storage rose by 46.67% YoY. Cumulatively, in 1Q-
3Q23, electricity generation grew by 13.36% YoY to 40.03bn kWh, with 
wind/solar/hydro/energy 
storage 
generation 
up 
by 
16.27%/8.92%/21.15%/56.67% 
YoY. 
Given 
the 
robust 
electricity 
generation growth in 3Q and Jan-Sep 2023, our full-year generation 
estimate of 55.82bn kWh remains unchanged. 
 CTGR announced its controlling shareholder China Three Gorges 
Group’s (CTG) shareholding increase plan, showing strong 
confidence in CTGR's business expansion. CTG plans to increase its 
stake in CTGR over the next 12 months, with an amount no less than 
RMB300mn and not exceeding RMB500mn at a price of no higher than 
RMB6/share. This move demonstrates that CTG has strong confidence in 
CTGR’s future renewable energy business development. 
 CTGR aims for a significant extension of new energy capacity 
installed for FY23E with abundant project resources. CTGR targets to 
add no less than 5GW of on-grid installed capacity for renewable energy. 
As at end-1H23, the company added 1.8GW, and had 13.2GW of capacity 
under construction. We believe CTGR will speed up its capacity installation 
process in 2H23E. Moreover, CTGR acquired new project resources with 
clear locations of 24.8GW, and acquired new approval and registered new 
energy projects of 14.2GW in Jan-Aug 2023. We believe CTGR’s 
abundant project resources and lower upstream cost will further support 
its long-term business expansion. 
 We keep our TP unchanged at HK$6.24, and maintained BUY. Thanks 
to robust power generation in 1Q-3Q23, we maintain our key assumptions 
largely unchanged and stay optimistic about CTGR’s future installed 
capacity. Thus, we keep our TP unchanged at HK$6.24, and maintain BUY 
rating.
