BUY (Upgrade)
 
Sinceourdowngradereporton
14 
Aug
 ( link
), 
we have 
sen a 
continuous 
decline 
on 
Innolight‘s share price by more than 23
increasingly
favourable
, driven by: 1) continuous strong momentum observed in 
building
up 
AI infrastructure globaly; 
and 
2) quick uptake sen in downstream 
aplicationmar
ket (e.g.,
 AI
- powered 
Ads
 adopted by Meta, Gogle and Amazon,
 
GitHubcopilot
 by Microsoft
) . In adition, companies within the AI hardware value 
chainstart to report strong earnings. 
On 
Thursday
 night
 (19 October)
, TFC (30394
 
CH
, NA
) ,  a 
leading integrated
 solution provider for optical sub
- asemblies
,  released 
impresive
 3Q23 earnings, 
delivering
 revenue/NP
 growth of 73.6% and 95.0% YoY, 
respectively
. As w
e believe Inolight 
is one of the true AI beneficiaries
, we expect AI
-
relatedrevenueto
contribute mor
e in
 Innolight‘
s revenue starting from 
the 
upcoming 
3Q
earnings
 and acelerate in 2024
, we 
upgrade to BUY with 
adjusted
 TP of
 
RMB
109.30
.  
¢ 
Share price is geting atractive again. 
We downgrade
 the share price in August 
as the stock has gone far ahead its earnings fueled by generative AI frenzy. 
Valuation was 
apealing 
and production ramp
- up of 80G
 transceivers
 should 
take 
time. We believe lots of negative 
news 
have ben baked into the price, e.
g., profit 
taking, chalenging macro, updated US restriction on advanced chip exports. 
Curent share price is geting atractive considering
:  1) 
transceiver is one of the 
critical components that 
is 
widely used in AI datacenters and the 
global demand on 
bu
ilding AI infrastructure remains strong
 with visibility into 2024
; 2) newly 
anounced US restriction should have non
- material impact
s  on the co
near
-  to
 mid
- term revenue; 
and 
3) continuous progres 
on
 monetization of 
generative AI should 
yield 
stabl
e investment
s  in the field.
 
¢ 
True AI beneficiaries 
apart from 
Nvidia start 
riding the tailwind. 
TFC just 
released 
strong 
3Q
 re
sults. 
Positioned upstream in Inolight's suply chain
 and
 
TFC's strong earnings further substantiate the ongoing capacity expansio
n among 
the beneficiaries in the AI sector. This also underscores our observation in our 
recent AI sector report (
link
) that the players in the AI 
value
 chain are gradualy 
experiencing positive 
outcome
 in 2023
.  
¢ 
Upgrade to BUY with 
TP of
 RMB109.30
.  Considering recent aditional orders 
reported 
by 
U DN
 ( link
)  regarding hy
perscalers and beter
- than
- expected ramp
- up 
of TSMC‘s CoWoS capacity, we expect 
to 
come in beter than 
our previous estimates. We revised up revenue forecasts by 
12
%, 
13
% and 
4 % 
and
 slightly
 lifted GPM 
for 
2023
E /24E
/25E
. We maintain the
 same multiple
 of 35x 
2025E P/E.
 
¢ 
Upside catalysts:
 1) faster
- than
- expected ramp
- up of 80G, 
and 
2) slower
- than
-
expected decline of non
- AI revenue. 
Downside risks
: 1) 
continuous 
rise in 
interest 
rates, 2) intensified geopolitical tensions
, and 
3) lower
- than
- expected production.
