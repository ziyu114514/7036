Luxshare (002475 CH) 
 
 
 
Resilient 3Q23 despite macro headwinds; 
Positive outlook for auto and comm. business 
 
Luxshare posted 3Q23 revenue/NP growth of -8.5%/+15.4% YoY, and pre-
announced FY23E earnings growth of 17.5-22.5% YoY, implying 31% YoY in 
4Q23E. 3Q23 earnings was largely in-line with the profit alert earlier, while 
weaker 3Q revenue was mainly due to 1) structural changes of communications 
product portfolio, 2) lack of wearables product launches, 3) SiP products delivery 
changes, 4) weaker Mini-LED sales, and 5) customer inventory corrections. 
Looking forward, despite ongoing macro headwinds, we believe that Luxshare 
is well-positioned to benefit from gain share in iPhone/MacBook/iPad/Watch 
OEM/components, and capture opportunities in automobile tier-1 and comm. 
businesses. We adjusted FY23-24E EPS by -4/-2% to factor in 3Q23 results 
and better margin. The stock now trades at 20.4/16.2x FY23/24E P/E, close to 
1-SD below 5-yr average P/E. Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB46.96 based 
on rollover 24x FY24E P/E.  
 3Q23 mostly in-line; Weaker topline due to inventory correction, SiP 
delivery changes, and slower wearables/Mini-LED. Despite weak 
smartphone/CE demand, Luxshare delivered a solid 3Q23 with NP growth 
of 15.4% YoY. Mgmt. attributed 3Q revenue decline to inventory correction, 
SiP delivery changes, and product portfolio optimization in comm. segment 
and weaker wearables/mini-LED sales. Backed by better revenue mix, GPM 
improved YoY/QoQ to 13.8% in 3Q23 (vs. 10.0%/11.3% in 1Q/2Q23).  
 FY23 Outlook: multiple product share gain and accelerated auto/comm 
segments. Luxshare pre-announced FY23E net income growth at 17.5-
22.5% YoY, implying 31% YoY in 4Q23 (vs 15% in 3Q). We believe stronger 
earnings in 4Q23 was a result of Luxshare’s share gain in top module 
/smartphone OEM biz and higher share allocation of high-end models. In 
addition, comm./auto tier-1 business are poised to deliver solid growth and 
better margins with order wins and product portfolio expansion in FY24/25E. 
 Attractive risk/reward; Reiterate BUY. We believe Luxshare’s operating 
efficiency will continue to improve with economies of scale in iPhone/ 
MacBook/iPad OEM/components, and growth momentum in auto tier-1 
business and communications segment will boost revenue upside in 
FY24/25E. We slightly adjusted FY23-25E EPS to reflect 3Q23 results and 
better profitability. The stock now trades at 20.4/16.2x FY23/24E P/E, close 
to 1-SD below 5-year hist. avg P/E. Reiterate BUY with new TP of RMB 
46.96 based on rollover 24x FY24E P/E. Catalysts include top module/ 
iPhone share gain and comm./auto tier-1 business progress.

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY with new TP of RMB 46.96  
We derived our new 12M TP of RMB 46.96 based on rollovered 24x FY24E P/E (vs prior 28x FY23E P/E for softer 
consumer electronics market). We believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver strong earnings growth, 
market share gain and product expansion to capture Apple and NEV opportunities in the next 3-5 years.   
Upcoming catalysts include share gain in Apple products, MR device ramp up and auto tier-1 progress. Major risks 
include weaker iPhone/AirPods demand, weaker yield improvement and slower integration of acquired businesses.
