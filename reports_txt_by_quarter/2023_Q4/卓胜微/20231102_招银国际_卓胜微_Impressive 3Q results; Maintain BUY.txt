Maxscend (300782 CH) 
 
 
 
Impressive 3Q results; Maintain BUY 
 
Maxscend announced its 3Q earnings. Revenue surged 80.2% YoY and 47.7% 
QoQ to RMB1.4bn, the highest quarterly revenue in the Company’s history. Net 
profit was RMB452mn with 94.3% YoY and 80.9% QoQ growth. The Company’s 
GPM slid from 49.2% in 2Q23 to 46.6% in 3Q23, as new factory is ramping up 
capacity. The Company’s NPM recovered from 26.2% in 2Q23 to 32.1% in 3Q23 
since the Company’s sales growth was back on track. Maintain BUY rating 
with TP adjusted to RMB174. 
 3Q revenue beat consensus estimates of RMB1.11bn. The Company’s 
3Q revenue grew on seasonal client restocking, new product share gain and 
favourable product mix. We think seasonality may be a crucial factor for 
3Q’s strong beat, as the industry-wide de-stocking efforts may have 
concluded.  
 3Q results suggest the demand is recovering and inventory is at a 
healthy level. The Company's inventory level has steadily decreased from 
the peak of RMB1.8bn in 3Q22 to RMB1.4bn in 3Q23, close to 3 months of 
sales (based on 3Q23 results). The Company also recorded RMB18mn 
reverse in inventory reserve, indicating the demand is recovering and the 
Company was very prudent during the downcycle.  
 Module segment to drive future growth. We remain optimistic on the 
Company’s performance in 2024/25E, particularly with the anticipation of 1) 
high performance SAW filters that are now in mass production and the 
Company is the first contender to do so in domestic market, 2) more than 
160mn units of the Company’s SAW filters have been integrated into its 
DiFEM, L-DiFEM and GPS modules, 3) duplexers and multiplexers are 
currently in mass production among several customers, and 4) the rollout of 
its new L-PAMiD products that may become a successful revenue driver in 
the future. We expect the Company to deliver top-line growth of 31% and 
32% YoY  in 2024/25E. 
 Maintain BUY with TP raised to RMB174, based on 42.0x 2025E P/E, 
~10% below its 1-year historical avg. of 46.6x, as the Company is 
transitioning into fab-lite model from fabless model and margin compression 
due to the ramp up of new fab. We believe the valuation is fair considering 
the NP CAGR of 46.7% over 2024-25E. The Company is trading at a 10% 
premium compared to its peers at 38.1x 2025E P/E, given its leading 
position in the RF market and as a key beneficiary of semi localization.
