Goertek (002241 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q23 weakness in line; Margin recovery on track into 
4Q/FY24E  in-lin e;  i n  
 
Goertek’s 3Q23 revenue/net profit growth of -6%/-73% YoY (+37%/+49% QoQ) 
was largely in line with previous market expectations. Impressive QoQ revenue 
growth was driven by Meta Quest 3 and new smartphone launches in 3Q23, and 
GPM improved 2.5ppts QoQ to 10.2% given higher utilization and new product 
ramp-up. Looking into 2H23E, we expect margin recovery to continue with better 
utilization and product mix, and revenue will sustain QoQ growth on PS5/Quest 
3 momentum. In the longer term, we believe Goertek is set to benefit from AR/VR 
opportunities and Watch share gains, delivering 58%/13% YoY EPS growth in 
FY24/25E. To reflect 1H23 results and better margins, we adjust FY23/24/25E 
EPS by -4%/+9%/+9% and raise TP to RMB19.2, based on the same 25x FY24E 
P/E (7-yr hist. avg). Maintain BUY. 
 3Q23 weakness expected; GPM recovery to accelerate in 3Q23. 3Q 
sales/net profit declined 6%/73% YoY and increased 37%/49% QoQ, largely 
in line, and 3Q GPM improved QoQ to 10.2% (vs. 7.7%/7.0% in 2Q/1Q23), 
boosted by improving product mix and better utilization on new product ramp-
up (Quest 3, PS5). We expect GPM to continue to recover to 10.2%/10.5% 
in FY24/25E (vs 8.4% in FY23E), given improving utilization and favourable 
product mix in FY24/25E.  
 Acquisition of UPhoton to strengthen optics product portfolio. Goertek 
announced its plan to acquire 100% of Uphoton by cash and share issuance. 
Uphoton is specialized in micro-nano optics (DOE, MLA), 3D structured light 
module, lighting vision/laser module and 3D sensing system solutions. We 
believe the acquisition will strengthen Goertek’s vertical integration capability 
in global AR/VR/XR supply chain. The company also announced a RMB500-
700mn share buyback plan for the employee share option incentive scheme, 
highlighting its confidence in long-term business outlook. 
 2024/25 outlook: PS5/Quest 3, TWS recovery and XR/gaming consoles. 
Riding on shipment momentum of PS5/ Quest 3, we believe Goertek’s VR/AR 
and gaming segment will become major growth drivers in FY24/25E (64%/ 
64% of FY24/25E sales), backed by new product launches and share gains 
in Meta, Pico and Sony supply chains. In the longer term, we believe Goertek 
is well-positioned to capture opportunities as a fully-integrated manufacturer 
in the global AR/VR/XR industry. 
 Maintain BUY. We think Goertek’s 3Q results reflected better-than-feared 
earnings recovery, and Goertek’s industry leadership and product roadmap 
in TWS/XR/acoustics/gaming segments will allow it to benefit from industry 
recovery and new MR product cycle in FY24/25E. Upcoming catalysts include 
Meta/Pico XR products and continued margin recovery.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB19.22 
Our new TP of RMB19.22 is based on the same 25x FY24E P/E (7-year hist. avg.). Overall, 
we believe Goertek’s industry leadership and product roadmap in TWS/XR/ 
acoustics/gaming segments will allow the company to benefit from industry recovery and 
market share gain in FY24/25E. Upcoming catalysts include Apple’s product launches, 
Meta/Pico XR products and margin recovery.
