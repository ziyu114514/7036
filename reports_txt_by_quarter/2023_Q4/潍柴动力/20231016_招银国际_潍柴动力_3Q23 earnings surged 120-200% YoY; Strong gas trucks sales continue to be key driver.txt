Weichai Power (000338 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q23 earnings surged 120-200% YoY; Strong 
gas trucks sales continue to be key driver  
 
Over the weekend, Weichai pre-announced that net profit in 3Q23 is expected 
to surge 120-200% YoY to RMB2.03-2.77bn, which is better than our 
expectation. The impressive 3Q23 earnings boosted the net profit in 9M23 up 
by 80-100% YoY. We believe the strong growth in 3Q was driven by natural gas 
trucks and export. We maintain our positive stance on Weichai as the decline in 
LNG price will continue to boost sales of LNG trucks/engines, where Weichai 
has strong presence. We revise up our 2023E/24E/25E earnings forecasts by 
17%/9%/8%, largely due to higher engines sales volume assumptions. We 
revise up our SOTP-based TPs for Weichai A/H to RMB14.7/HK$16.1. Reiterate 
BUY.   
 Weichai’s engine sales outpaced industry in 8M23. Weichai's multi-
cylinder sales (including HDTs and other large-size engines) grew 25% YoY 
to ~460k units in 8M23, much better than the industry average of 6%, 
according to CICEIA. The market share reached ~17% in 8M23, up 2.6ppt 
YoY.   
 HDT industry sales volume +55% YoY in Sep. According to the 
preliminary data from Cvworld, China HDT industry sales volume in Sep 
(including export) grew 55% YoY to 80k units, driven by strong demand for 
natural gas trucks and export. In 9M23, China HDT sales volume (including 
export) grew 32% YoY to ~690k units. 
 Natural gas HDT accounted for 31% of total HDT sales in Sep. The latest 
LNG price declined 40%+ from the peak in late 2022, while the diesel price 
dropped <20% during the period. Sales of natural gas HDT therefore has 
had a strong run since early this year, with the percentage of total HDT sales 
rising from 7% in Dec 2022 to 31% in Sep 2023. We believe the current 
price difference will continue to boost the sales of LNG trucks given the 
lower operating cost to truck owners. Weichai will continue to be a key 
beneficiary as we estimate Weichai has >50% market share in the HDT gas 
engine sector.   
 Risk factors: 1) weakness in engine export; 2) increase in component cost; 
and 3) weaker-than-expected new business growth.
