Shennan Circuits (002916 CH) 
 
 
 
Pending industry recovery with in-line 3Q results 
 
Shennan Circuits released its 3Q results. Revenue was RMB3.4bn, with YoY growth 
of -2.4% and QoQ growth of 5.5%. Net profit (NP) was RMB434mn, with YoY growth 
of 1.1% and QoQ growth of 62.3% (including a one-time government subsidy o 
RMB151mn).  Gross margin slightly expanded to 23.4% in 3Q from 23.0% and 22.8% 
in 1Q and 2Q, driven by 1) a favorable product mix, 2) cost optimization, and 3) 
improved utilization in the substrate segment. We think QoQ growth in revenue and 
margin improvement are positive signs, suggesting the industry is bottoming out 
gradually. We maintain HOLD on Shennan Circuits with an adjusted TP of 
RMB73.2, considering weak demand from legacy telecom spending and the ongoing 
macro pressure.  
 Shennan’s 3Q revenue grew 5.5% QoQ, in line with our estimate. The mild 
growth was largely driven by customer restocking. We believe 4Q revenue should 
remain at a similar level, as we do not expect a meaningful rise in demand in the 
near term. We estimate overall revenue to decline 8.1% YoY in 2023. For 
2024/25E, we expect revenue to grow 14.3% and 18.2% YoY. 
 For PCB segment, 1) auto products continued to serve as a primary revenue 
driver, 2) telecom demand remained weak, and 3) modest revenue growth was 
seen in the Datacom market. For substrate segment, sales of substrate 
products in 3Q were better than 1H23, with an improving utilization rate. We start 
to see recovering signs in the semi industry.  
 Maintain HOLD with adjusted TP of RMB73.2. We adjust our 2023/24/25E NP 
by 15%/2%/-3%. We revise up 2023 NP estimate, mainly due to the one-time 
government subsidy. Our new TP is RMB73.2 based on the same multiple of 25x 
2024E P/E, slightly higher than 1SD below 5-year historical average. We think 
the valuation is justified given the PCB sector is still facing challenges and weak 
telecom demand for legacy products.
