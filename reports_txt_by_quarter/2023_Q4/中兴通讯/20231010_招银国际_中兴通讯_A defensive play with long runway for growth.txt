A defensive play with long runway for growth  
 
 ZTE’s recent update on AI-related development: At a recent investor relations 
event, the Company shed light on its progress in AI development for the B2B sector. 
The Company featured a foundational AI model, a R&D model (AI-assisted 
programming), a telecom model (streamline telecom carriers’ operations), and an 
industry-specific model (focusing on urban governance) aimed to be rolled out 
between year-end and early 2024. Capitalizing on the AI momentum spurred by 
ChatGPT in 1H23, the Company is set to debut new computational products and is 
on track to launch an AI server, specifically engineered for intensive model training. 
 We observe rising popularity of satellite communication, as Huawei’s 
Mate60Pro could support satellite calling. ZTE's Axon 50 Ultra can also facilitate 
two-way communication (messages) via the BeiDou satellite system. In a recent 
milestone, ZTE partnered with China Telecom, UNISOC and Vivo and achieved the 
first-ever domestic 5G NTN (non-terrestrial network) field test in China. This 
accomplishment signifies the successful establishment of a bi-directional connection 
for 5G NTN mobile phones, directly linked to satellites in a real-world setting. We 
believe ZTE will be a key beneficiary in this market, considering more consumer 
electronics will be equipped with satellite communications. 
 5G to 6G, into the next chapter: With increasing interest in satellite 
communications, the market is waiting for the progress of 6G development. CAICT 
predicted that the number of 6G terminal connections of various types will increase 
by more than 30 times compared to 2022, and the average monthly traffic will 
increase by more than 130 times, which will significantly drive the demand for 
telecommunication equipment. Given ZTE’s strong presence in the relevant fields, 
it is well-positioned to extend its leadership into the 6G competition. 
 H-share: maintain BUY with unchanged TP of HK$29.4. We update TP of A-
share to RMB39.5 based on 16.5x (3-year avg.) rollover FY24E P/E. Maintain 
BUY. Currently, the Company is experiencing steady growth, marked by a 
continuous increase in market share and a noticeable enhancement in gross profit 
margins. Key areas of focus include: 1) the Company's progress in the server 
market, especially for AI servers, 2) the development and commercialization 
progress of foundational large models in their v2.0 iteration, 3) R&D efforts in 
satellite communication, as well as investment opportunities in related industry 
chains, and 4) the latest development in the realm of 6G. Potential risks include 
China-US trade tensions, additional component restriction/technology ban, and 5G 
deployment delays.

While the industry is currently focused on large-scale generic models, the real concern for 
businesses should be on their value in specific industry applications. In view of this, ZTE is 
set to offer AI infrastructure services tailored to foundational models that span a wide range 
of knowledge zones. Not only will they provide comprehensive support for model training 
and logical reasoning, but also introduce specialized models targeting specific industry 
needs, ensuring an overall smooth digital transformation.

ZTE joining the satellite communication league 
In 2022, amid a sluggish mobile market, satellite communication emerged as a vital 
breakthrough for many handset companies. Apple’s iPhone 14 series introduced a satellite 
communication feature, albeit limited to only sending messages. Around the same time, 
Huawei launched its Mate50Pro, marking the company's entry into satellite communication 
phones. And in early 2023, ZTE released its Axon 50 Ultra that supported satellite 
messaging communication. This overall trend could also imply that satellite communication 
offers opportunities not just for handsets but also for various other consumer electronic 
products. As the mobile satellite communication value chain continues to evolve, there are 
significant prospects for telecom carriers, mobile companies, hardware & software 
developers, etc., to unlock the full potential of this new tech.

ZTE to benefit from the transition from 5G to 6G 
In 2020, ZTE entered into an agreement with China Unicom to collaborate on 6G 
technology. The Company outlined a research phase from 2020 to 2023 to explore network 
demands, structural aspects, and technological capabilities for 6G. By June 2023, the 
company publicly announced the commencement of research on crucial 6G technologies. 
ZTE anticipated that 6G would be a seamless evolution, building upon the success of 5G 
and 5G-advanced paradigm. Consequently, ZTE believed that their well-established 
technological expertise in 5G-related domains could be effectively extended to the realm 
of 6G.
