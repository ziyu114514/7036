Mixed 3Q results 
 
ZTE released its 3Q23 results. Quarterly revenue of RMB28.7bn (-12.4% YoY 
and -9.1% QoQ) was below market expectation, largely due to lower-than-
expected telecom revenue. 3Q net profit was RMB2.4bn, with 5.1% YoY and -
16.3% QoQ. GPM was resilient at 44.6% in 3Q23 (vs. 38.1%/42.0% in 3Q22/ 
2Q23), showing Company’s competitiveness in the telecom market. We revised 
down our EPS forecast for 2023-25E by 5%/7%/9%, reflecting a slowdown in 
growth in 3Q23. Maintain BUY with adjusted TP of RMB36.9. 
 3Q revenue missed market expectations, mainly due to 1) server revenue 
missed expectations, 2) lower-than-expected telecom sales as a result of 
delayed 5G tender, 3) ongoing pressure on consumer and enterprise/ 
government segments under macro headwinds. We think the 5G tender 
delay was a temporary impact on seasonality. However, we trimmed our 
revenue forecasts by 9%/13%/14% for 2023, 2024 and 2025, respectively, 
reflecting greater-than-expected headwinds on non-carrier revenue and 
slower-than-expected server business ramp-up. 
 Resilient GPM continued to be the spotlight. Despite the decline in 
revenue, GPM remained at 44.6% for 3Q23. We expect full-year GPM to be 
42.8%. Looking forward, considering the Company’s competitiveness in the 
telecom market, we believe the Company’s margin will remain stable at the 
current level.  
 Maintain BUY, with revised TP to RMB36.9, based on the 16.5x (3-year 
avg.) FY24E P/E. We trim our net profit forecasts by 5%/7%/9% for 
2023E/24E/25E, due to cautious outlook for global telecom spending and 
soft consumer/ corporates spending. Potential downside risks include Sino-
US trade tensions, additional component restriction/technology ban, and 5G 
deployment delays.
