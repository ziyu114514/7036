Topline growth to gradually recover in FY24E. Despite the weak topline momentum in 
9M23, our base case suggests ICBC’s topline growth to turn positive starting from FY24E. 
With interest rate adjustment in residential mortgage completed in 4Q23, we believe NIM 
pressure will lessen from FY24E, partly also supported by ICBC’s solid balance sheet 
growth as a result of backing up real economy. For FY23E, NIM would be down 32bps 
YoY; but the reduction would be much smaller at 9bps and 7bps YoY for FY24E and 
FY25E; overall, we expect NIM to be 1.44%-1.60% over FY23E-25E. This would support 
a NII CAGR of 3.8% in FY22-25E. We assume net fee income growth to turn positive in 
FY25E, considering the policy stance directing big banks to reduce fee rates, as well as 
the unfavorable capital market and slow recovery in retail consumptions. Overall, we 
anticipate a topline CAGR of 2.9% over FY22-25E. 
 
Asset quality outlook to stay benign. With the rollout of supportive measures for the 
real estate sector, we expect the bank’s asset quality outlook to remain benign in 
FY23E-25E. Its NPL ratio would be in the range of 1.31%-1.35%, which is lower than the 
system average of 1.61% as of Sep 2023, according to the NAFR. The declining NPL ratio 
would support risk buffers, and our base case estimates ICBC’s provisioning ratio and 
provision coverage ratio to be in the range of 2.98%-3.10% and 220.74%-236.64% in 
FY23E-25E. Assuming China’s macro growth to recover steadily without any new major 
risk outbreaks, we project provision expenses to expand at 1.3% CAGR over FY22-25E.

Maintain BUY on improving earnings outlook. By lowering our FY23E/24E earnings by 
6.98%/10.30%, our base case suggests a 3.2% CAGR over FY22-25E. By lowering its 
sustainable ROAE and raise our COE assumptions in the GGM model, we adjust our H/A 
TPs by -22.3% and -13.8% to HK$ 4.91 and RMB 5.61. The TPs imply 0.45x/0.55x target 
FY24E P/B. Reiterate BUY on ICBC’s market leading position and improving earnings 
outlook. 
 
Risk Factors: 1) Potential asset quality deterioration in specific sectors and geographical 
areas; 2) Persisting NIM pressure; 3) Slow recovery in net fee growth; 4) Reducing ROAA 
and ROAE; 5) High social responsibility given its status as a market leader.
