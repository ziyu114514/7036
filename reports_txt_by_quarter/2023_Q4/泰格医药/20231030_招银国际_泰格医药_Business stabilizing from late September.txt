Tigermed (300347 CH) 
 
 
 
Business stabilizing from late September 
 
Tigermed reported 3Q23 revenue of RMB1,940mn, up 7.1% YoY (vs +3.3% 
YoY in 1H23), and attributable recurring net income of RMB405mn, down 3.8% 
YoY (vs +2.9% YoY in 1H23). 3Q23 revenue accounted for 24.9% of our 2023 
full-year estimate, in line with its historical average, while attributable recurring 
net income represented 22.7% of our forecast, which fell short of its historical 
average of ~27%. If excluding COVID vaccine revenue, 3Q23 revenue would 
grow by ~18% YoY (vs ~27% YoY in 1H23). Management indicated a policy 
headwind impacting patient enrolments in 3Q23, which has already largely 
resumed normal by late Sep. Gross profit margin (GPM) in 3Q23 continuously 
rose to 41.2%, improving by 1.0ppt QoQ and 0.2ppt YoY. According to 
management, GPM would be ~41.7% if excluding COVID vaccine revenue, 
which declined 1.3ppt YoY. The adj. gross margin dilution was mainly due to  
the impact from policy headwinds, margin pressure from lab business and the 
strong recovery of low-margin SMO services. Additionally, new orders 
(excluding pass-through fees) signed in the quarter achieved positive growth 
amid the harsh business environment. Tigermed’s operating cash flows in 9M23 
was RMB673mn, down 18.5% YoY. 
 Globalization to serve as a long-term driver. Tigermed acquired a 
Croatia-based clinical CRO, Marti Farm, in Jan 2023, further enhancing its 
service capability in Europe. Althrough the Company adjusted its personnel 
in Europe to reflect the post-COVID demand changes, Europe still plays a 
critical role for patient enrolments in MRCTs as well as for biosimilar 
projects. In the US, Tigermed doubled its local clinical operation team to 
more than 110 staff in 1H23. In the Europe and US market, Tigermed 
strategically aims to collaborate with small- to mid- sized companies with 
intention of incorporating China in their MRCTs (especially CGT projects) 
and Chinese clients going to overseas markets. Management expected the 
growth of the US and EU business to outpace that of Tigermed as a whole. 
Besides, Southeast Asia and Latin America market with large population 
bases continue to remain as strategic end markets for Chinese pharma 
companies in the long term, creating extra business opportunities for 
Tigermed. 
 ADC and obesity to trigger additional clinical demands. Although the 
global biotech market has saw an initial inflection point in terms of financing, 
management of Tigermed pointed out the continuously decreasing risk 
tolerance of clients, leading to the longer waiting time from request-for-
proposals (RFPs) to contract signing. However, management indicated that 
the successful POC and commercialization of certain products in 
international market, such as ADC and obesity drugs, will bring additional 
clinical demands to clinical CROs. Specifically, Tigermed has already 
observed a growing interest from client on obesity drugs.   
 Maintain BUY. We revised our TP from RMB94.41 to RMB80.31, based on 
a 10-year DCF model (WACC: 11.5%, terminal growth: 3.0%), to factor in 
slower projection of recurring net income growth. We forecast Tigermed’s 
revenue to grow 7.3%/ 24.9%/ 26.0% YoY and attributable recurring net 
income to grow 9.2%/ 23.8%/ 27.6% YoY in FY23E/ 24E/ 25E, respectively.
