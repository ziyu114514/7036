China Longyuan (001289 CH) 
 
 
 
Oct operating data recap 
 
China Longyuan (CLY)’s operating data in Oct 2023 was lower than our 
expectation, with a YoY decline of 10.99% in total power generation due to 
lower wind power generation. However, thermal power and other renewable 
power showed solid growth. CLY has implemented share repurchases to 
demonstrate confidence in its operations. Additionally, as a pioneer of 
renewable power operator in China, CLY is expected to benefit from the 
collaborative efforts of China and the US to triple global renewable energy 
installed capacity by 2030. Consequently, we adjust our TP to RMB23.98 
and maintain BUY. 
 Oct operating data slightly missed our estimates. In Jan-Oct 2023, CLY 
recorded accumulated power generation of 60,953,811 MWh, up by 5.87%
YoY. In particular, wind power generation rose by 3.31% YoY, while its 
thermal power generation dropped by 3.07% YoY. During the same period, 
other solar and renewable power maintained rapid growth of 139.05% YoY. 
In Oct 2023, CLY’s power generation declined by 10.99% YoY to 
5,449,262MWh, dragged by lower wind power generation which declined by
19.59% YoY. However, thermal power and other renewable power remained 
solid growth, up by 15.57%YoY and 162.92% YoY. 
 CLY previously approved and implemented a resolution to repurchase 
H shares.  The share repurchase will be carried out in multiple stages, with 
the price not exceeding 5% of the average closing price of the company's H 
shares in five trading days prior to the repurchase. The repurchase quantity
will not exceed 10% of the total H shares issued. In Nov 2023, CLY 
repurchased 3.58mn H shares (accounted for 0.0427% of existed issued 
shares) at a price range of HK$ 6.07-6.43/share, totalling HK$ 22.5mn. CLY 
plans to continue the share buyback to demonstrate confidence in its 
operations and regard the current share price as attractive. 
 CLY as the pioneer of renewable power operator in China will benefit 
from China-US collaboration in tripling renewable energy capacity by 
2030 under the Sunnylands Statement. China and the US worked jointly
in The Sunnylands Statement to address the climatic crisis and strive to triple 
global renewable energy capacity by 2030. CLY is the pioneer of renewable 
power operators in China, its new energy installation process and 
development will be further speed up. For 2023E, we believe CLY may 
achieve its previous newly-added installed capacity target of 5500MW. 
 TP was adjusted to RMB23.98, maintain BUY. Thanks to the strong 
operating data of Jan-Oct 2023, we lowered our estimated wind power 
utilization hour and solar power utilization hours, and updated our predicted 
power 
generation 
to 
78,575GWh/92,919GWh/109,795GWh 
for 
23E/24E/25E. Therefore, we slightly adjusted our TP to RMB23.98 for CLY-
A, based on 22x FY24E PE and FY24E rolling EPS of RMB1.09. Maintain 
BUY.
