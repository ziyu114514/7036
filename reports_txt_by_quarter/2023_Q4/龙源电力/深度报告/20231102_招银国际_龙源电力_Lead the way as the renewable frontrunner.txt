beat. 
For 
1Q-3Q23, 
CLY's 
revenue 
was 
RMB28.097bn, down by 7.00% YoY. However, the attributable net profit 
increased by 18.95% to RMB6.379bn. In particular, the wind power 
generation revenue saw a 3.53% increase, while the thermal power 
segment revenue experienced a 34.17% YoY decline. Other renewable 
power segment saw a solid increase of 68.48%YoY driven by robust solar 
power growth. The net profit attributable to shareholders up by 14.1% YoY 
thanks to increased newly-added installed capacity and lower operating 
cost.  
 Taking advantage of the “substitution of large for small" policy, CLY 
has actively upgraded and expanded old wind turbines' installed 
capacity, expecting significant long-term earnings improvement. The 
policy allows for the retrofitting and upgrading of old wind turbines that have 
operated for over 15 years with installed capacity below 1.5 MW. CLY, with 
nearly 30 years of wind power project operation experience, owns a 
significant number of old turbines, with 70% having a capacity below 1.5 
MW and 3,000 turbines below 1 MW. Seizing the policy opportunity, CLY 
aims to enhance its wind power generation efficiency and project scale. 
 On-grid tariffs of wind power and thermal power improved in 1Q-
3Q23; CLY has actively engaged in green electricity and green 
certificate trading. Both wind and thermal power tariffs rose in 1Q-2Q23, 
driven by higher tariffs and electricity demand in the southern region. 
Additionally, CLY has actively engaged in green electricity and green 
certificate trading, generating an income of RMB400mn from approximately 
1bn kWh of trading. It has mature experience in green electricity and green 
certificate trading, which we think will provide favorable prospects for future 
growth. 
 Assign a TP of RMB23.28 for China Longyuan-A with a BUY rating. 
We estimate CLY's EPS for 2023/2024 to be RMB0.97/1.14, representing 
an increase of 58.6/17.8% YoY. We assign a TP of RMB23.28 for CLY-A, 
based on a target FY23E P/E ratio of 24.0x. Currently, CLY-A trades at 
21.5x FY23E P/E, and we believe the valuation is attractive, given the rapid 
growth of its newly-added installed capacity of wind and solar power, and 
solid revenue growth potential from retrofitting old wind turbines. We have 
a BUY rating on the stock.

Furthermore, CHN Energy has committed to transferring its existing wind power business 
to CLY within the next three years, leading to a significant increase in CLY's future wind 
power installed capacity. The agreement, signed between the two companies, has already 
seen the transfer of 2 GW of wind power assets to CLY, with plans to transfer additional 
wind power assets still being developed. This move has helped CLY to rapidly expand its 
wind power capacity, driving substantial revenue and profit growth for the company. 
 
Business overview 
CLY has emerged as a major comprehensive power generation conglomerate primarily 
focused on renewable energy. It operates over 300 wind farms across China, along with 
various power projects including solar, biomass, tidal, geothermal, and thermal power. Its 
operations span 32 provinces, municipalities, and countries such as Canada and South 
Africa.  
By 2022, CLY's total controlled installed capacity across different power sources had 
reached 31,107.8 MW. Wind power amounted to 26,191.8 MW (accounting for 84.20% of 
the total), solidifying its position as the world's largest wind power operator. Thermal power 
capacity stood at 1,875 MW (accounted for 6.03%), while other renewable energy sources 
recorded 3,041 MW (accounted for 9.77%). 
As a leading player in onshore wind power, CLY has consistently delivered positive overall 
results. Its net profits for the years 2019 to 2021 were RMB 4.53bn, RMB 4.98 bn, and 
RMB 6.40bn, with growth rates of 6.66%YoY, 9.97%YoY, and 28.67%YoY. 
However, there was a decline in net profit in 2022. The profit decline was caused by: 1) the 
decreased profit expectations for related subsidiaries or asset groups; 2) an increase in 
electricity sales volume and revenue lagging behind the growth of new energy construction 
costs; and 3) a decline in average on-grid tariff and weak wind resource.

Additionally, a significant increase in impairment provisions dragged its profit in 2022 as 
follows. Firstly, the company implemented “substitution of large for small”” in some old 
onshore wind power projects, resulting in an impairment of RMB590mn. Secondly, due to 
the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the company's projects in Ukraine experienced decreased 
profit expectations, resulting in a provision of RMB640mn. Thirdly, some assets 
experienced long-term operating losses, resulting in a loss provision of RMB51mn. 
Moreover, some project companies in Heilongjiang and Guangxi experienced long-term 
delays or suspension of construction, resulting in a provision of RMB260mn.

The company's thermal power business is operated by subsidiaries Jiangyin Sulong 
Thermal Power Co., Ltd. and Nantong Tianshengang Power Generation Co., Ltd. With a 
consistent thermal power capacity of 1,875 MW over the past three years, this segment's 
revenue has remained stable and serves as a significant supplement to the company's 
operating revenue and gross profit. In 2021 and 2022, thermal power revenue was stable 
and amounted to RMB 9.31bn and RMB 8.78bn, respectively, maintaining stability.  
 
Fuel sales primarily consist of coal sales, which have experienced revenue and gross profit 
margin volatility due to fluctuations in coal prices.  
 Power generation experienced rapid growth 
 
In recent years, the company has been adding 1.5-2.3mn kW of wind power capacity 
annually. The total attributable installed capacity of wind power increased from 10,546.6 
MW in 2012 to 26,191.8 MW in 2022.  This expansion in installed capacity has led to 
substantial growth in power generation. 
The company’s total power generation has displayed an upward trend, indicating overall 
growth in electricity production. From 2019 to 2022, the total power generation increased 
by approximately 39%. This growth was primarily driven by the expansion of wind power 
generation, which has compensated for the decline in thermal power generation and 
contributed to the overall increase in renewable energy generation. 
 
For wind power, CLY’s wind power generation has grown rapidly. The growth rates of wind 
power generation range from 3.01% YoY in 2019 to 17.44% YoY in 2021. In 2022, wind 
power generation increased by 13.7% YoY. This trend indicates a strong focus on and 
investment in wind power. 
 
For thermal power, generation has declined over the years. The decrease trend in thermal 
power generation can be seen from 2019 to 2022.

 Analysis of key performance metrics in CLY’s wind power operations  
 
 
1) On-grid tariff showed a trend of decline while green electricity and green 
certificate trading increased  
CLY’s average on-grid electricity price for wind power remained steady at RMB0.482/kWh 
in 2019 and increased slightly to RMB0.487/RMB0.489/kWh in 2020/2021. However, by 
2022, it decreased to RMB0.481/kWh due to a raised proportion of electricity transactions. 
 
In 1H23, CLY's average on-grid electricity price was RMB0.457/kWh, with on-grid tariff of 
wind power at RMB0.469/kWh (a 3.5%YoY decrease), that of solar power at 
RMB0.313/kWh (a 33.7% YoY decrease), and that of thermal power at RMB415/MWh (a 
3.9% YoY drop). The decline in average on-grid tariff was attributed to the growth in the 
proportion of electricity transactions. 
 
For 1Q-3Q23, the average on-grid electricity price for wind power was RMB0.474/kWh, 
while for thermal power, it was RMB0.421/kWh. Both wind and thermal power tariff 
experienced an overall increase compared to 1H23, driven by higher tariff in south region. 
 
Additionally, the company’s revenue from green electricity and green certificate trading saw 
a rise, reaching RMB400mn in 1Q-3Q23, with a total of 1bn kWh traded. We believe that 
as green electricity and green certificate trading mature, it will bring significant revenue 
growth for CLY in the future.

2) Utilization hours and electricity sales  
 
For utilization hours and wind condition, in 2022, the average utilization hours for CLY’s 
wind power were 2,296 hours, which decreased by 70 hours compared to 2021 due to a 
decline in average wind speed. However, 1H23 showed an improvement, with wind power 
utilization hours of 1,271, an increase of 98 hours compared to the same period in 2022. 
In 1H23, wind power utilization hours slightly improved to 1,388 hours. 
 
For electricity sales, in 2022, the company's total electricity sales reached 68,145,463 
MWh, with wind power accounting for 56,295,80 MWh. Wind power sales increased by 
14.95%YoY, primarily driven by an increase in installed capacity, and alower curtailment. In 
1H23, electricity sales amounted to 38,496 GWh. 
 
Figure 11: Utilization hours (2018-2022) 
 
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimate 
 Thermal power experienced growth slowdown 
For 2022, CLY’s sales volume of thermal power increased by 1.60% YoY, primarily due to 
reduced power consumption rates at Jiangyin Sulong and Nantong Tianshengang Power 
Co.. These companies benefit from a favorable location in Jiangsu Province, with high 
electricity demand and prices. Their cogeneration units, operating under a clean energy 
dispatch mechanism, enjoy priority within the regional power grid, resulting in higher 
efficiency and utilization hours. 
By 2022, the combined installed capacity of the two companies totaled 1,875,000 kW. In 
2020, thermal power generation decreased by 5.21% due to the growth of external power 
supply and new energy generation. However, there was a significant increase of 19.28% 
in thermal power generation in 2021, accompanied by higher utilization hours. In 2022, 
cumulative thermal power generation continued to grow, reaching 70,633,024 MWh, with 
an 11.6% YoY increase.

For solar power, China's solar power installed capacity was 392 GW in 2022, and the solar 
bidding capacity for 2022 was about 155 GW. Based on views of China Photovoltaic 
Industry Association (CPIA), China's conservative prediction for newly-added installed 
capacity of solar power in 2023 will be 95GW, and the optimistic prediction will be 120 GW. 
Meanwhile, according to data from the NEA, the newly-added installed capacity of solar 
power in 1Q23 was 33.66 GW, up by 154.81% YoY. As of Apr 2023, domestic PV 
component bids had exceeded approximately 82 GW.  
 
In the first eight months of this year, China added 113.16 GW of solar power installed 
capacityrepresenting YoY growth of 154.46%. This is in line with our optimistic 
expectations, so we maintain our previous forecast and we are positive that the newly-
added installed capacity of solar power in 2023 may reach 120 GW, with cumulative 
installed capacity of 513 GW for the year.  
 
Additionally, solar power will continue to maintain high growth in 2024 and 2025, and we 
estimate cumulative solar power installed capacity will reach 652 GW and 811 GW. 
By 2025, we estimate the cumulative installed capacity of wind and solar power will reach 
1,409 GW, exceeding the national 14th Five-Year Plan target of 1,200 GW.

 
Technological innovation in the wind power industry will further reduce the cost 
of wind power operation 
China’s wind power industry is undergoing technological innovation during these years, 
and new technologies will further reduce the cost of wind power. Currently, technological 
innovation in the wind power industry is mainly focused on three areas: 1) advances in wind 
turbine technology, including large-scale, high-efficiency, intelligent, and modular turbines; 
2) improvements in wind farm operation and maintenance management technology, 
including digitization, intelligence, autonomy, and integration; and 3) optimization of wind 
farm layout and design, including site selection, wind farm layout, wind farm integration, 
and multi-energy complementarity. 
 
 
Policy support for the solar power industry and energy storage 
The solar power industry has also received policy support, and policy dividends will drive 
rapid development of the solar market, in our view. In recent years, the NEA  has issued a 
notice on solar power generation development, proposing a series of policy measures, 
including increasing support for developing PV power for poverty alleviation, promoting the 
construction of “solar power+ energy storage” projects, and accelerating the construction 
of demonstration PV power stations for poverty alleviation, providing strong policy 
guarantees for the development of the solar power industry.

technological improvement, and broad market prospects.  
 
In the future, wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation will continue to be 
the main forms of new energy power generation, in our view. At the same time, to better 
promote the development of new energy power generation, we believe it is also necessary 
to strengthen grid construction and research on energy storage technologies, and improve 
the consumption capacity and stability of new energy power generation. 
 
Abundant project reserves to support continued growth in 
electricity generation 
During the "14th Five-Year Plan" period, the CHN Energyaims to add 70-80 GW of new 
energy installed capacity, while CLY plans to achieve 30 GW of new energy installations. 
In 2021, there was an addition newly-added installed capacity of 2 GW, followed by 4.4 GW 
newly added attributable installed capacity in 2022.  
 
For 2023, CLY's target is to add 5.5-6.5 GW of newly-added installed capacity, with a split 
of 45% for wind power and 55% for solar power. With the declining prices of solar 
components, we expect that the company will achieve solid newly-added installed capacity 
in solar power. From 2024 to 2025, CLY anticipates an average annual addition of 8-9 GW 
of newly-added installed capacity.  
 
Additionally, in 2022, CLY's new projects reserves increased by 9.8% YoY, reaching 62 GW, 
and the company secured development quotas of 18.37 GW and won bids for offshore 
wind power and solar projects with a total capacity of 2,100 MW. In 1H23, new project 
development agreements totaling 29.34 GW were signed, marking a 77.94% YoY increase, 
and development quotas of 4.01 GW were achieved.

Lower upstream costs lead to higher IRR of wind farm and 
solar power projects, lifting CLY’s investment willingness  
The wind power industry in China has entered the Grid Parity Era since 2021, leading to a 
reduction in upstream costs and a decline in wind turbine prices. According to Wind Power 
Headlines, the highest price for onshore wind turbines reached RMB4,200/kW in mid-2020 
and fell to the lowest at RMB1,150/kW (ex-tower tube) in Feb 2023, dropping by 73%. 
Therefore, lower upstream costs have resulted in an increase in the IRR of wind power 
projects, making more projects suitable for investment by CLY.As a result, we expect CLY 
to show a higher willingness to invest in wind power installation in 2023. 
 
In the past three months, turbine prices have experienced a rebound. From May to July, 
the price of onshore turbines (excluding the tower) increased to RMB1,652/kW, returning 
to early 2023 levels. However, in recent tenders and purchases, prices have been lowered 
again. In the latest few weeks the average winning bid price for a 350 MW onshore wind 
power project (ex- the tower) was RMB1,601/kW. The lowest winning bid price (ex-the 
tower) was RMB1,420/kW, while the highest winning bid price was RMB1,788/kW. The 
winning bid price, including the tower, was RMB2,100/kW.

Source: NDRC, CMBIGM estimates 
 
The optimization of the industrial chain in the wind power sector reduces cost and increases 
efficiency, which drives the long-term growth in IRR of the onshore wind power projects. 
For example, if the average tariff (incl. tax) for the project is RMB0.45/kWh, and the 
construction cost of a 100MW onshore wind power project falls from RMB4,500/kW to 
RMB4,000/kW, the IRR of the project would increase from 11% to 14.3%. Additionally, if 
the construction cost decreases further to RMB3,800/kWh, the IRR would increase to 
15.5%. Despiterecent wind turbine prices have experienced a slight rebound;, the lowest 
bidding prices in the market remain around RMB1,400. We believe that a reasonable price 
level would be around RMB1,600. Despite this, we believe the overall profitability outlook 
remains optimistic, indicating a positive IRR.

*Assuming utilization hours of 2,000 
 
As the IRR for wind farm projects increases thanks to lower upstream costs, more projects 
will meet CLY's investment IRR criteria. Therefore, a higher IRR of wind power projects is 
likely to boost CLY’s investment willingness in newly-added wind power installations. 
 
For solar farms, given the upstream costs continue to drop, we believe the IRR of wind 
farm projects will further rise. Recently, the lowest reported price for solar module 
components reached a historical low of RMB1.18/W (in July 2023). In the recent bidding 
for a 9 GW photovoltaic component procurement by China Huadian, an astonishingly low 
price of RMB0.993/W was observed, breaking the barrier of RMB1/W, according to the 
latest group procurement. In light of CLY’sfocus on increasing photovoltaic installed 
capacity in 2023, we believe the company can easily achieve and exceed its new energy’s 
newly-added installed capacity targets for 2023. As a result, CLY’s new project IRR is 
expected to further increase, and the process of solar power capacity installation is 
expected to accelerate. 
 
Figure 20: Sensitivity analysis of IRR (solar power project) 
  
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates  
 
Lower upstream costs in the short to medium term are expected to benefit the IRR of CLY’s 
new energy projects, while continuous technological progress may also create 
opportunities for IRR improvement. Otherwise, changes in the non-technical costs related 
to local governments will need to be monitored to comprehensively measure a project’s 
IRR as well.  
 
Additionally, CLY’s accelerated deployment of wind and solar power installed capacity, as 
well as active deployment of energy storage, should support the stability of its wind and 
photovoltaic power generation. However, developing energy storage capacity may increase 
construction costs and put some pressure on the project's IRR. Therefore, overall changes 
in IRR should be considered comprehensively. 
 
 
The improvement of power generation and average utilization hours 
Due to the rapid increase in wind power and solar power installed capacity, China's wind 
power and solar power generation have grown significantly. The average utilization hours 
of grid-connected wind and solar power equipment have shown an overall upward trend, 
mainly due to the significant improvement in the wind and solar power curtailment rate.

 CLY’s business highlights and valuation 
Increase in installed capacity with strong focus on solar power 
In the first three quarters of 2023, CLY experienced a significant increase in installed 
capacity for renewable energy. The total newly-added installed capacity for new energy 
reached 1,701.66 MW, with wind power contributing 570 MW and solar adding 1,121.81 
MW. As of Sep 2023, the company's attributable installed capacity had reached 32.81 GW, 
with solar power showing the highest growth rate. The cumulative installed capacity 
development target for renewable energy since 2021 reached 47.38 GW, with a strong 
focus on photovoltaic projects. We believe the abundant project reserves will support CLY 
to reach the installed capacity target in 2025.

Harnessing the "Replacing Small with Large" strategy and riding the 
wave of favourable policies 
CLY, a company with around 30 years of operation, is capitalizing on the "Replacing Small 
with Large" strategy and favorable policies. The policy allows for the upgrading of wind 
turbines operating for over 15 years and with capacities smaller than 1.5 MW. This presents 
a significant opportunity for CLY, as it has been involved in wind power projects for nearly 
30 years. The company aims to prioritize the comprehensive upgrade of old wind turbines, 
especially those below 1 MW, which account for 70% of the total. By seizing this window 
of opportunity, CLY aims to maximize the capacity expansion potential and enhance 
efficiency.

Slight decrease trend in on-grid tariff and mature green energy 
trading system 
Despite the on-grid tariff showed a decline trend in recent years due to higher electricity 
trading proportion..CLY has also established a mature green energy and green certificate 
trading system. In 1Q-3Q23, the company conducted 61 transactions, resulting in 1bn kWh 
of green electricity traded at a premium price compared to the benchmark price. This 
trading system provided additional revenue of RMB400mn. The company remains 
confident in the opportunities presented by the green energy market. In the future, we 
believe CLY will benefit more from green power and green certificate trading. 
Share repurchases plan as a display of confidence 
On Sep 2023, CLY granted general authorization to the Board of Directors to repurchase 
up to 10% of the total issued H-shares during the authorized period. This decision reflects 
the company's confidence in its future prospects and signifies its commitment to enhancing 
shareholder value. 
 
Financial analysis and valuation 
 
P&L analysis 
From 2020 to 2022, CLY's main operating income remained stable, with growth rates of 
5.11%, 29.10%, and 7.24% YoY, respectively. In 2022, the company achieved a main 
operating income of RMB39.45bn, primarily from wind power and thermal power. The main 
operating costs of the company increased by 2.70%, 34.61%, and 7.50% YoY in 2020, 
2021, and 2022, respectively.  
 
In 2022, the main business costs amounted to RMB25.905bn, with a composition similar 
to that of the main business income, mainly from the wind power and thermal power 
sectors. The company's gross profit margin for the main business was 37.22%, 34.87%, 
and 34.34% from 2020 to 2022, respectively.  
 
Over the past three years, operating expenses have shown a stable increasing trend, with 
financial expenses being the largest component.  
 
CLY's net profit for the years 2020, 2021, and 2022 was RMB5.748bn, 7.263bn, and 
6.096bn, respectively. The significant decrease in net profit is mainly due to declining 
electricity prices and asset impairment, with the company recognizing asset impairment 
losses of RMB2bn in 2022, a substantial increase compared to the previous year.

installed capacity and higher wind power sales. However, the thermal power segment saw 
a decline in revenue due to weak demand and reduced coal sales. Operating expenses 
decreased by 11.97% YoY, and financial expenses dropped by 14.4% YoY. Attributable net 
profit showed a positive trend, increasing by 18.97% YoY, primarily due to the growth in 
installed capacity and improved power sales performance.

Balance sheet (B/S) analysis  
CLY has obtained most of its project investment funds through external financing, resulting 
in a continuous expansion of liabilities in recent years. At the end of 2020, 2021, and 2022, 
the company's total liabilities amounted to RMB107.757bn, RMB116.587bn, and 
RMB144.765bn, respectively, with liability-asset ratios of 61.71%, 61.59%, and 64.95%.  
 
The proportion of current liabilities to total liabilities increased from 47.42% in 2020 to 
51.23% in 2022, while the proportion of non-current liabilities increased from 50.02% to 
53.68% during the same period. The company's total assets mainly consist of fixed assets 
and construction in progress, accounting for a significant proportion of total assets. As of 
the end of 2022, the proportion of fixed assets and construction in progress to total assets 
was 68.36%.  
 
Accounts receivable, including bills receivable, accounts receivable, and other receivables, 
amounted to RMB276.43bn at the end of 2022, with a YoY increase of RMB5.73bn. The 
increase in accounts receivable is mainly attributed to the increase in renewable energy 
power generation and the delayed receipt of renewable energy generation subsidies.  
 
Overall, the company's liability scale has expanded due to external financing, while the 
asset structure is predominantly composed of fixed assets and construction in progress, 
with a certain increase in current assets. The growing scale of accounts receivable still take 
time to figure out.

 Key assumptions and valuation 
In 2022, the company's attributable net profit decreased by 31.1% YoY to RMB5.11bn. This 
was primarily due to a one-time provision for impairment of RMB2.04bn. Excluding the 
impact of impairment, the attributable net profit decreased by RMB340mn mainly because 
of unfavorable wind conditions, resulting in lower revenue in 2022. 
 
Looking ahead, we anticipate that the company's revenue will increase by 7%, 11% YoY 
and 10%YoY in 2023/2024/2025, reaching RMB42.6bn,RMB47.2bn and RMB52.0bn, 
respectively. We expect no significant impairment factors to affect the company in 2023, 
and we project that the net profit attributable to shareholders will increase by 59%YoY, 8% 
YoY, 9% YoY in 2023/ 2024/2025, reaching RMB8.11bn,RMB9.55bn and RMB10.36bn, 
respectively. 
 
Additionally, we estimate the company's earnings per share for 2023 and 2025 to be 
RMB0.97,RMB1.14,RMB1.24/share, respectively. 
Figure 28: Key assumptions (2020-25E) 
  
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates 
 
We assign a target price of RMB23.28 for CLY-A shares, based on FY23E P/E ratio of 24.0x 
(close to +1SD of 3-year avg. P/E). Currently, CLY-A trades at 21.8x FY23E P/E. We believe 
the valuation is not demanding but still has upside potential. Given the rapid growth of the 
company’s newly-added installed capacity of wind power and solar power, improved wind 
condition, and "substitution of large for small" will unlock growth potential, we have a BUY 
rating for CLY-A.
