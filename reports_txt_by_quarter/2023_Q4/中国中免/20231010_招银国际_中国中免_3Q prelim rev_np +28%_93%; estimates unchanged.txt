CTGDF (601888 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q prelim rev/np +28%/93%; estimates unchanged 
 
CTGDF reported preliminary 3Q financial data with revenue increasing by 
+27.9% YoY to RMB15.0bn, gross margins expanding to 34.3% (1Q/2Q: 
28.8%/32.5%), and net profits growing +93.1% to RMB1.3bn. The quarter’s 
revenue was apparently flattish compared to that of 2Q, and that should not 
come in as a surprise to the market given the trajectory we observed in the 
visitation momentum to Hainan (6M: 30.3% YoY vs 8M: 38.6% YoY). Other than 
that, a slightly lower pre-tax margin of 10.8% (2Q: 11.9%) caught our attention 
and that was probably owing to higher revenue shares to airports. All in all, when 
consensus expectation is tapering, we continue to argue that earnings risk is 
incrementally contained, and our implied 4Q revenue/net profits of 
RMB21bn/1.7bn should look intact on a seasonally stronger festival travelling 
and spending.  
 Major 10.1 Golden week indicators were a mixed bag... A total of 826mn 
people travelled domestically between the 8 days of 29 Sep to 6 Oct, 104% 
of pre-COVID but is below government target of 113%. In dollar terms, 
tourism revenue of RMB753bn stood at 102% of pre-COVID level. Each 
traveller spent 4% less vs pre-COVID and yet 5% more vs the 5.1 holiday 
this year. Our TMT team noted that long-haul travel has increased to 51% 
of the mix, compared to 35% in 2022. 
 … but those of Hainan looked well-expected. A total of 4.3mn tourists to 
the Island during the break, 107% of pre-COVID and 133% of the level seen 
in the 5.1 holiday this year. The number of DF shoppers per day is 3% less, 
and each shopper spent 3% less compared to 5.1. 
 Earnings change. We largely maintain our forecasts for now and wait for 
further details at full results release on 27 Oct.  In our model, we continue 
to assume RMB46bn Hainan DFS revenue (including Haitang Bay).  
 Valuation. We maintain our average valuation from 2018 inclusive. In our 
view, there is presumably no quick fix to the flattering consumption recovery, 
and now we project CTGDF to grow at a more normalised cadence over 
2024-25E in tandem with the macro economy. With no major changes to 
our earnings forecasts, our revised TP is based on an updated 27.5x (from 
previously 29.0x) end-24E P/E which still benchmarks to -1sd below 5-year 
average since 2018.
