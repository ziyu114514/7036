WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
Peptide business becoming a new growth driver  
 
WuXi AppTec reported 3Q23 revenue of RMB10,670mn, up 0.3% YoY, and 
attributable recurring net income of RMB2,948mn, up 23.8% YoY, with attributable 
adjusted non-IFRS net income of RMB3,072mn, up 24.3% YoY. 3Q23 revenue 
accounted for 25.6% of our 2023 full-year estimate, in line with its historical average, 
while attributable adjusted non-IFRS net income represented 29.1% of our forecast, 
higher than its historical average of c.26%. In 9M23, non-IFRS gross profit margin 
(GPM) improved by 3.6ppt to 42.3% while non-IFRS net profit margin increased by 
3.7ppt to 27.6%, driven by favourable currency exchange rates and continuously 
improved operating efficiency. As of Sep 2023, overall backlog increased by 25% YoY, 
if excluding commercial COVID-19 projects, per management. Considering the weak 
demand in early-stage discovery services, management revised down the full-year 
revenue YoY growth target from 5-7% to 2-3%, which now implies non-COVID 
revenue growth of 25-26% YoY in 2023E. Nevertheless, management slightly raised 
non-IFRS gross profit margin target by 0.5% to 41.7-42.1% for 2023E to reflect the 
further improved operating efficiency. Additionally, management has proposed to 
terminate the 2023 H-share incentive plan, and to repurchase and cancel over 15.5mn 
H-shares (~0.52% of total share capital) with a value of HK$1.3bn.   
 Healthy growth from non-COVID projects. Excluding commercial COVID-19 
projects, 9M23 revenue of WuXi AppTec would grow by 23.4% YoY, primarily 
driven by the 48.2% YoY growth of the D&M services within its chemistry segment. 
Based on our calculation, in 9M23, the Company booked c.RMB3.0bn revenue 
from commercial COVID projects. In addition, the management expected the 
weak global demand in early-stage R&D services to be temporary and is confident 
in the Company’s long-term growth outlook. The management indicated WuXi 
AppTec’s revenue to grow more than 20% YoY in next few years (excluding the 
impact of commercial COVID projects).  
 TIDES business to become the next growth driver. We believe the promising 
TIDES (mainly oligo and peptides) business will become a major growth driver for 
the Company. In 9M23, TIDES revenue grew by 38.1% YoY, on top of 337% YoY 
growth in 2022. More excitingly, backlog of TIDES as of Sep 2023 dramatically 
increased by 245% YoY, leading to the management guidance of over 60% YoY 
growth in TIDES revenue 2023E and another 60%+ YoY growth in 2024E. To 
accommodate the rapidly growing demand of peptide drugs, WuXi AppTec aimed 
to increase its solid phase synthesizer capacity for peptide production to 32,000L 
by the end of 2023, one year ahead of its original schedule. We expect the 
Company to generate meaningful future revenue from providing CMO services for 
a blockbuster dual-targeted GLP-1 product. We expect the Company to capture 
the growing opportunities in the global peptide market given its sizable peptide 
manufacturing capacities and strong global customer network. 
 Maintain BUY. Our TP remains largely unchanged at RMB116.01, based on a 
10-year DCF model with WACC of 10.73% and terminal growth of 2.0%. We 
forecast WuXi AppTec’s revenue to grow by 2.8%/ 17.2%/ 23.5% YoY and 
adjusted non-IFRS net income to grow by 15.2%/ 17.8%/ 24.7% YoY in 2023E/ 
24E/ 25E, respectively.
