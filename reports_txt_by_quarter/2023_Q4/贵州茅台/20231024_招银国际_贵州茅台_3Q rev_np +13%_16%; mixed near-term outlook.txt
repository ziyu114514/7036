Kweichou Moutai (600519 CH) 
 
 
 
3Q rev/np +13%/16%; mixed near-term outlook 
 
3Q net profit grew 16.0% YoY to RMB16.9bn. The growth momentum 
sequentially decelerated from 20.8% in 1H, as revenue of the quarter slowed in 
tandem to 13.1% from 19.4% in 1H. The 17% 9M revenue growth still largely 
tracks to consensus estimates; however, an unchanged 15% full year revenue 
growth guidance could imply 4Q revenue growth to dip further to HSD%, the 
lowest we note since 3Q20. In fact, the trend looks to go hand-in-hand with 
distributors’ reluctance to restock after the Golden Week Holiday, when 
consumers have been increasingly trading down, and when sentiment to 
consume has been languishing. On the contrary, as a positive note, price 
fluctuations for the flagship Feitian remained in-range and wholesale price (seal 
case) settled at around RMB2,900 per bottle, about RMB100 lower than what 
we saw last month. These in aggregate put together a relatively mixed near-
term outlook for Moutai, in our view. That said, in the medium term, we are still 
hopeful of seeing Moutai’s brand premium, product scarcity and efforts in 
diversification (crossovers with other F&B brands) could shield the company 
from exposing to any risk of malignant pricing and irrational destocking, 
especially when the odds of a prolonged demand recovery has become more 
alarming.  
 Sales mix. 3Q/9M sales revenue recorded RMB33.5bn/102.9bn, 
+13.1%/+18.3% YoY. Moutai spirit sales in 3Q grew +15% YoY/ +10% QoQ 
to RMB27.9bn, when sales contribution was sequentially flattish at 83.5%. 
Direct channel sales of the quarter inflated +35% YoY/ +9% QoQ to 
RMB14.8bn, with "iMoutai" platform showing major growth at +37% 
YoY/+25 QoQ, contributing RMB5.5bn revenue. Meanwhile, wholesale 
channel's revenue was RMB18.7bn, up + 2% YoY/+10% QoQ 
 Cashflows. OCF of the quarter grew +432% YoY to RMB50bn, thanks to a 
RMB42bn cash received from sales activity. Cash on hand raised to 
RMB159.3bn with a RMB9.6bn net increase. These were in line with a 
higher contract liability which went up by RMB4.1bn in the quarter to RMB 
11.4 bn. 
 Earnings change. We moderately trim our 2023-25E revenue and net profit 
by-0.9% to -2.9%/ -1.4% to -3.5% to reflect the results. 
 Valuation. Our TP is based on an updated 39.0x (from previously 41.0x) 
end-23E P/E, which still represents long-term average since 2019. Our 
methodology reflects our relative optimism (vis-a-vis other F&B diversified 
of which target multiples are based on -1sd below long term average) on 
Moutai that it could outperform its peers thanks to its brand premium and 
product scarcity.
