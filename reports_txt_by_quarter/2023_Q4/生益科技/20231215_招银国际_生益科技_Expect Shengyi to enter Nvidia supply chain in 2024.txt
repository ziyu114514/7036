Shengyi Tech (600183 CH) 
 
 
 
ExpecExExpect Shengyi to enter Nvidia supply chain in 2024  
BUY (Maintain) 
We have noticed several news outlets reporting that Shengyi Tech’s latest ultra-
low (UL) loss CCL product (Synamic9GN) has been certified by Nvidia and is 
expected to begin the next testing phase soon. Entering Nvidia’s supply chain 
not only is a validation of the company’s R&D capabilities, but also suggests the 
company is likely to see continued margin expansion as high-end products 
typically yield a higher margin. Our positive outlook for the company is further 
bolstered by its extensive market reach and the potential for the CCL sector to 
recover more quickly than the PCB sector in 2024. Maintain BUY with an 
unchanged TP at RMB20.39. 
 Based on our checks, Shengyi Tech’s UL loss CCL product 
(Synamic9GN) has indeed been certified by Nvidia. This is a major 
breakthrough for the company as high-end products imply higher margins, 
benefitting Shengyi Tech’s future financial performance. Also, we speculate 
Nvidia may incorporate this UL loss CCL in its upcoming AI chips (see 
Figure.1 for Nvidia’s tech roadmap). Additionally, sufficing Nvidia’s 
certifications may also imply the company’s product can meet the 
requirements from other chip designers, such as AMD and Intel. 
 Shengyi Tech is expanding its operations beyond China. The company 
made plans to invest as much as RMB1.4bn (~US$196mn) in Thailand to 
establish a new plant to respond more flexibly to rising global demand in July 
2023. Coincidentally, Nvidia has also recently stressed the strategic 
significance of the Southeast Asia region as the US tech ban on China 
seems to be escalating further (link). We believe Southeast Asia has become 
not only an alternative manufacturing and logistics hub for many global tech 
giants but also a market with considerable untapped potential.  
 We see this update as a positive catalyst for the company. Demand for the 
new generation of CCL products could boost the company’s top and bottom 
lines in the coming years. Maintain BUY with an unchanged TP at 
RMB20.39.
