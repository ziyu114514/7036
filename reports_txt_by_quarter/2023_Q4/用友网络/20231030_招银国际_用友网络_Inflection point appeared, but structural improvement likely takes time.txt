Yonyou (600588 CH) 
 
 
 
Inflection point appeared, but structural 
improvement likely takes time   
HOLD (Upgrade) 
Yonyou reported (28 Oct) mixed 3Q23 results: revenue was RMB2.3bn (+14 % 
YoY), in line with Bloomberg consensus estimates, and demonstrated an 
improvement from -5% YoY decline in 1H23, thanks to the gradual wear off of 
reorganizational impact. 3Q23 net loss attributable to ordinary shareholders was 
RMB185mn; although it narrowed from that of RMB284mn in 3Q22, it missed 
consensus of a loss of RMB138mn, which we attribute to the 4.3ppt miss on 
GPM, which came in at 50.9% (3Q22: 49.9%). We upgrade the stock from SELL 
to HOLD given likely better outlook on revenue growth and margin improvement 
in 4Q23 with the wear off of reorganizational impact, but overall macro and 
enterprises’ budget pressure takes time to relieve, and we await more concrete 
evidence to become more positive. Our TP of RMB16.45 is based on 5.5x 
EV/Sales (was 6.0x) on 2023E revenue, in line with the one-year mean.  
 Inflection point on cloud revenue growth appeared…In 3Q23, cloud 
services revenue was RMB1.6bn, up 28% YoY (1H23: 2.0% YoY) and ERP 
revenue fell 10% YoY to RMB713mn. Cloud service revenue for large /mid-
sized enterprise came in at RMB1.1bn/162mn for 3Q23, with respective 
growth of 22%/61% YoY, improving from -3%/+25% YoY in 1H23. 
Management highlighted that new contract value growth was over 20% YoY 
each month for four consecutive months since June 2023 vs. -6% YoY in 
5M23, and cumulative contract value for large enterprises reached 
RMB3.0bn/1.27bn in 9M23/3Q23, up 17/29% YoY, which both demonstrated 
an improvement in fundamentals, in our view.  
 …but concrete margin improvement likely takes time. GPM improved 
1.0ppt to 50.9% in 3Q23, driven by healthy revenue growth, but was 4.3ppts 
shy of consensus forecast due to greater-than-expected impact from 
organizational change (especially for large enterprise projects). As for 
operating expenses, S&M expenses grew 20% YoY in 9M23 (30.3% of total 
revenue, +4.7ppts YoY), administrative expenses up 1% YoY in 9M23 
(14.0% of revenue, -0.2ppt YoY), and R&D expenses grew 1% YoY in 9M23 
(26.2% of total revenue, -0.3ppt YoY). We estimate ARR contribution for 
cloud revenue to be stable YoY at around 32% for Yonyou (vs. >60% for 
Kingdee) in 2023, and we believe an increase in ARR contribution is vital to 
drive the unleash of operating leverage over the long term.  
 Cut target price to RMB16.45 but upgrade to HOLD. Yonyou’s share price 
has fallen 33% vs. -8% for CSI300 YTD, and we believe the market has 
priced in the impact of the organizational changes. With a better revenue 
growth outlook compared with that in 1H23, further downside on stock price 
could be limited, but recovery on macro and enterprises’ digitalization budget 
likely still takes time to bring concrete improvement on Youyou’s top-line 
growth, and we await more concrete evidence to become more positive.
