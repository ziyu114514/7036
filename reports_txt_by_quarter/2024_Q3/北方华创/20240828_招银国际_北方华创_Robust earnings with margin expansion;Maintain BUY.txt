CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Naura Technology (002371 CH) 
 
 
 
Robust earnings with margin expansion; 
Maintain BUY 
 
Naura announced 1H24 results. 1H revenue grew 46.4% YoY to RMB12.3bn, 
while NP grew 54.5% YoY to RMB2.8bn, both aligning with the mid-point of 
company’s earnings pre-announcement. 1H24 revenue/NP were 40%/46% of 
our FY24E forecast, consistent with the company’s historical seasonality, which 
saw 38%/46% in 1H23. GPM improved to 45.5% in 1H24 (vs. 42%/41% in 
1H23/FY23), while NPM expanded to 22.5% in 1H24 from 17.7% in FY23. We 
think Naura’s 1H24 results confirm that the company’s growth trajectory remains 
intact. Looking forward, we expect Naura to 1) ride the tailwinds of 
semiconductor localization trend, 2) grow on product coverage expansion and 
market share gains, and 3) benefit from economies of scale and improving 
GPM. Reiterate BUY with TP unchanged at RMB405. 
 1H24 revenue in-line with expectation. From a quarterly standpoint, 2Q24 
revenue/NP increased by 42.2%/37.0% YoY (vs. 38%/120% YoY in 2Q23) 
and 10.5%/46.8% QoQ. We maintain our previous revenue projection for 
2024/25E, given the in-line results. The company’s 1H24 semiconductor 
equipment revenue increased by 55.1% YoY, making up 92% of total 
revenue (vs. 87% in 1H23). We believe that escalating geopolitical tensions, 
coupled with the push for faster domestication of semiconductor equipment 
and favorable policies/subsidies, have contributed to the company’s 
enhanced revenue in 1H24. We expect the equipment segment to grow 
45.9%/28.5% YoY in 2024/25E, and maintain our total revenue projection 
at RMB30.9bn/RMB39.0 for the same period, implying 39.7%/26.5% 
growth. 
 Better-than-expected GPM expansion, driven by favourable product 
mix and economies of scale. 2Q GPM was 47.4%, up 4.0ppt sequentially. 
We revised up our 2024/25E GPM forecasts by 5.2ppt/3.9ppt, as we believe 
Naura will continue to benefit from these tailwinds and maintain GPM at a 
similar level. We revised up our 2024/25E NP forecasts by 9%/1%, on 
higher GPM estimates. The accretive impact will be partially offset by higher 
R&D and other operating expenses, since Naura’s priority is to expand its 
product coverage.  
 We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura, with an unchanged TP at 
RMB405. The TP implies a valuation at 35.77x 2024E P/E, close to 1SD 
above 2-year historical average forward P/E, which we think is justified 
considering Naura’s leading position in domestic semiconductor equipment 
market. Naura is our favourite pick under the semiconductor localization 
theme. Risks: 1) intensified competition from overseas and domestic peers 
and 2) escalating geopolitical tensions.
