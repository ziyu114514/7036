SANY Heavy (600031 CH) 
 
 
 
Expect a better 2H24E but consensus remains 
high; Maintain HOLD 
 
During the post-results call, SANY Heavy (SANY) remained positive on the 
overseas outlook despite the recent weakness of excavators in Europe and the 
US. SANY expects the sales in the US to see potential stabilisation in 2025E, 
while the growth in emerging countries will continue to be strong. For 2H24E, 
SANY expects China’s sales to stabilize (-12% in 1H24) while overseas sales 
growth will accelerate (+4.8% in 1H24). Given that our 2024E-26E earnings 
forecasts (unchanged after 1H24 results) remain 13-29% below consensus 
even taking into consideration of growth acceleration in 2H, we maintain our 
HOLD rating with an unchanged TP of RMB14.8, based on 24x 2024E P/E.  
 2Q24 results highlights. Revenue dropped 3% YoY to RMB21.2bn. Gross 
margin slightly contracted 0.4ppt YoY to 28.6%. S&D / administrative 
expense ratio increased 0.3ppt / 0.4ppt YoY to 8%/3%, while R&D expense 
ratio reduced 0.5ppt YoY to 6.2% (a continuous reduction trend since late 
2022). Pre-tax profit slightly increased 0.5% YoY, as the FX loss (versus 
large gain in 2Q23) was offset by a reduction of fair value loss. Net profit 
increased 5.5% YoY to RMB2bn, helped by lower tax rate. Operating cash 
inflow surged 1x YoY to RMB4bn from a low base.  
 Overseas revenue growth driven by Africa in 1H24. Overseas revenue 
in 1H24 (62% of total revenue) grew 4.8% YoY to RMB23.5bn. In terms of 
region, Africa surged 66% YoY to RMB2.3bn (10% of overseas revenue). 
Asia Pacific (ex-China) grew 3% YoY to RMB9.2bn (39% of overseas). 
Europe grew 1% YoY to RMB8.2bn (35% of overseas). America revenue 
dropped 4% YoY to RMB3.8bn (16% of overseas). In terms of products, 
overseas’ excavator / concrete machinery / crane were -7%/+10%/+20%. 
Overseas gross margin expanded 0.6ppt YoY to 31.6%.      
 Outlook for emerging markets: SANY expects Africa (+60% YoY in 
1H24), Latin America (+70% in 1H24) and the Middle East will see explosive 
growth potential across different products. India is expected to maintain 
30% growth going forward and SANY will increase the production capacity 
there. For Indonesia (where SANY has 30% market share for excavators), 
sales were affected by the election but have been recovered recently.   
 Outlook for Europe and the US. Sales in the US market were affected by 
high inventories, and SANY expects a recovery in 2025E. For Europe, 
cranes will see decent growth in 2H24E.   
 Outlook for China. Small-size excavators have maintained an accelerated 
growth trend, while medium & large-size excavators are stabilizing. 
Concrete machinery and cranes remain on a downtrend.

Valuation  
 
Our TP of RMB14.8, based on 24x 2024E P/E which is equivalent to 0.5SD above the 
average of 20x since 2017. We apply an above average target multiple as we see initial 
signs of stabilisation of excavator sales in China’s market, and we expect a moderate 
recovery in 2025E.

Figure 7: SANY’s P/B band 
 
Source: Company data, Bloomberg, CMBIGM estimates 
Note: 12M forward P/B on daily basis 
 
 
Upside risk: stabilization of property investment in China  
 
Downside risks: further slowdown of overseas demand; further deterioration of China’s 
demand
