Mindray (300760 CH) 
 
 
 
Robust performance in a challenging industry 
environment 
 
Mindray achieved a revenue of RMB20.5bn in 1H24, marking an 11.1% increase 
YoY, and reported an attributable net profit of RMB7.6bn, up 17.4% YoY. Despite the 
ongoing regulatory adjustments in the healthcare industry and the delay in medical 
equipment renewals projects, which have led to a cautious approach towards bidding 
and procurement activities in public hospitals, the revenue from domestic equipment 
business decreased by 12% YoY. However, thanks to the rapid growth of the IVD 
business and the domestic high-end/ultra-high-end ultrasound business, Mindray still 
demonstrated strong resilience and steady growth. The increase in the revenue share 
from IVD reagents and high-end ultrasounds drove the Company's gross margin up 
by 0.7 ppt YoY to 66.3% in 1H24. Additionally, Mindray announced a mid-term 
dividend plan, distributing a total cash dividend of approximately RMB4.9bn, which 
represents a payout ratio of more than 65%, indicating an ongoing increase in the 
dividend payout. 
 Domestic equipment business faces pressure. In 1H24, the continued delay 
in bidding and procurement activities led to a 12% YoY decrease in revenue from 
domestic equipment business. Due to the high market share of Mindray's Patient 
Monitoring and Life Support (PMLS) products in China, the domestic business 
was significantly affected by the industry environment, with the PMLS segment 
experiencing a 7.6% YoY decrease in revenue, including about a 20% drop in 
domestic revenue. The Medical Imaging segment benefited from the volume 
increase of the first domestic ultra-high-end ultrasound Resona A20 and other 
high-end ultrasounds, resulting in a 15.5% YoY revenue growth in this segment, 
with high-end and ultra-high-end ultrasound revenues increasing by over 40%. 
 Accelerating the shift towards consumables-related business. In 1H24, the 
IVD reagent business was minimally affected by domestic industry regulation, 
with revenue increasing by 28% YoY to RMB7.7bn, accounting for over 37% of 
total revenue. Domestic IVD revenue grew by over 25%, and domestic reagent 
revenue increased by 30%, with reagent revenue representing over 80% of 
domestic IVD revenue. Internationally, Mindray successfully penetrated over 60 
overseas third-party chain laboratories in 1H24 and installed the first MT 8000 
TLA, driving a more than 30% YoY increase in overseas IVD revenue. We believe 
that the continuous increase in domestic diagnostic demand and the 
implementation of IVD VBP are expected to help Mindray rapidly expand its 
domestic market share, while accelerated cooperation with high-end clients will 
support long-term rapid growth of the IVD overseas market. Additionally, the 
minimally invasive surgery business grew by 90% YoY in 1H24. The Company’s 
acquisition of APT Medical also filled the gap in its cardiovascular consumables 
business. Currently, consumables-related businesses led by IVD already account 
for over 50% of the Company’s domestic revenue. 
 Maintain BUY. We believe that industry regulation has not affected the essential 
demand for hospital procurement. As industry regulation becomes normalized 
and equipment renewal policies are implemented, hospital procurement is 
expected to gradually recover. Based on a 9-year DCF model, we adjust the 
target price to RMB 352.84 (WACC: 10.3%, perpetual growth rate: 3.0%).
