Goertek (002241 CH) 
 
 
 
Solid GPM recovery in 1H24; Poised to benefit from 
“AI+XR” trend in 2H24E 
 
Goertek’s 1H24 revenue/ net profit growth of -11%/+190% YoY was largely in-
line with its earlier positive profit alert (net profit +180-200% YoY). 2Q24 
revenue/net profit delivered +0.1%/+168% YoY, and GPM came in at 13.6% 
(+4.4 ppts QoQ/5.9 ppts YoY), mainly due to improving efficiency and better 
acoustics product/smart product profitability. Looking ahead to 2H24/FY25E, we 
expect Goertek’s earnings will continue to rebound given improving GPM and 
better AR/VR/gaming demand with multiple product launches from major VR/AR 
players. We raise FY24-26E EPS by 19-38% to reflect 1H24 results, a stronger 
GPM and better operating leverage. In longer term, we believe Goertek is well 
positioned to capture opportunities in the AR/VR product cycle from players 
such as Meta, Sony, Google, Samsung and Huawei. Maintain BUY with new TP 
of RMB25.9, based on rollover 25x FY25E P/E (prior 25x FY24E P/E).  
 1H24 in-line with profit alert, impressive GPM across all segments. 
Goertek’s1H24 revenue/attributable net profit growth of -11%/+190% YoY 
was largely in-line with its positive profit alert. Strong revenue growth in 
precision components and acoustic products segments (+21%/+38% YoY) 
was partly offset by smart product weakness (-32% YoY), due to the late 
product cycle of Sony gaming console/VR and Meta Quest 3. 2Q GPM came 
in at 13.6% (+4.4 ppts QoQ/5.9 ppts YoY), mainly due to improving efficiency 
and better acoustics product/smart product profitability.  
 2H24/25 outlook: Expect continued GPM recovery; positive on “AI+XR” 
trend in 2H24E. In addition to solid recovery of acoustic product segment, 
we believe Goertek is well positioned to benefit from new product launches 
of Meta Quest 3S and Sony PS5 Pro gaming console in 2H24E, along with 
AR glass product launches from multiple players, which should continue to 
drive profitability recovery and topline growth. Overall, we expect Goertek’s 
net profit to grow +164%/23% YoY in FY24/25E. 
 Maintain BUY. We think Goertek’s industry leadership and product roadmap 
in XR/acoustics/gaming segments will allow it to benefit from industry 
recovery and the upcoming new XR/gaming console product cycle in 
FY24/25E. We lift our FY24/25E EPS estimates by 19-38% mainly for better 
GPM and operating efficiency. Our new TP of RMB25.9 is based on a rolled-
over 25x FY25E P/E (vs prior 25x FY24E P/E). Maintain BUY. Upcoming 
catalysts include new XR/gaming product launches and continued margin 
recovery.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB25.9 
Our new TP of RMB25.9 is based on a rolled-over 25x FY25E P/E (vs prior 25x FY24E 
P/E). Overall, we believe Goertek’s industry leadership and product roadmap in TWS/XR/ 
acoustics/gaming segments will allow the company to benefit from industry recovery and 
market share gains in FY24/25E. Upcoming catalysts include new XR product launches 
and continued margin recovery.
