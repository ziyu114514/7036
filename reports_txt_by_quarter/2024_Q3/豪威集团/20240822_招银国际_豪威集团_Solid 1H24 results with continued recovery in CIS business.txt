Willsemi (603501 CH) 
 
 
 
Solid 1H24 results with continued recovery in 
CIS business 
 
Willsemi released 1H24 results. Revenue increased by 36.5% YoY to 
RMB12bn, while net profit grew 790% YoY from a low base in 1H23 
(RMB153mn) to RMB1.37bn in 1H24. On a quarterly basis, the company 
achieved a record revenue at RMB6.4bn in 2Q24 (42.5% YoY/14.2% QoQ, in 
line with consensus estimate). Q2 net profit was RMB809mn, up 45.1% QoQ 
(2Q23 was in net loss). GPM improved to 30.2% in Q2 (vs. 27.9%/17.3% in 
1Q24/2Q23), suggesting a steady recovery. NPM expanded to 12.6% in 2Q24 
(vs. 9.9%/-1% in 1Q24/2Q23) with a better cost structure. Mgmt. attributed the 
results to 1) steady recovery of consumer sentiment in 1H24, 2) growing 
adoption of Willsemi’s products in the high-end smartphone market (esp. in 
domestic Android models) and strong growth in auto CIS, and 3) an improving 
GPM on a favourable product mix.  Maintain BUY with TP adjusted to 
RMB115.39, based on 40.7x 2024E P/E. 
 CIS sales continued strong growth momentum in 1H24 (49.8% YoY/-
0.1% HoH). Mobile/auto/IoT/medical CIS grew 78.5%/53.0%/77.8%/41.6% 
YoY, while security/notebook CIS declined 26.7%/9.0% YoY, respectively. 
Without a broad recovery of end-market demand, Willsemi’s CIS sales for 
mobile/auto/IoT/medical delivered resilient growth, driven by 1) share gains 
in domestic high-end Android market (i.e., new flagship OV50H sensor), 2) 
demand for ADAS and in-cabin cameras continuing to increase to fulfill 
autonomous driving and security needs, 3) the industrial automation trend, 
and 4) inventory restocking behaviours. We expect CIS sales to grow 
another 15% HoH in 2H24, implying 29% YoY in 2024. We project the 
segment revenue to grow 21%/18% YoY in 2025/26E. 
 Touch/display business remains weak, while analog segment shows 
signs of recovery. Touch/display revenue decreased 28.6% YoY, due to 
ongoing inventory digestion and ASP pressure. Analog sales were up 
24.7% YoY on improving market conditions and share gains. We expect 
touch/display segment to recover in 2025, driven by the introduction of low 
power-consumption and auto-grade products. Analog sales are forecasted 
to grow double-digits on better market conditions and share increases. 
 Maintain BUY with slightly adjusted TP at RMB115.39, based on 40.7x 
2024E P/E, which is 1-SD above 1-year historical avg. forward P/E, 
given Willsemi’s leading market position and continuous share gains. 
We revise NP forecasts for 2024/25E by -1%/3%, on higher R&D costs, as 
the company plans to ramp up new products and enhance its 
competitiveness. Key risks are 1) slower-than-expected end-market 
demand recovery and 2) intensified competition.
