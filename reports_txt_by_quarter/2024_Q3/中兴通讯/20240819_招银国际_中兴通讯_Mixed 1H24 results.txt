ZTE (000063 CH) 
 
 
 
Mixed 1H24 results 
 
ZTE’s announced 1H24 results. Revenue increased by 2.9% YoY to 
RMB62.5bn, while net profit grew by 4.8% YoY to RMB5.7bn in 1H24. Despite 
the headwinds from declining capex of domestic telcos for ZTE’s carrier 
business, non-carrier businesses managed to grew double-digits (14.3% and 
56.1% YoY growth in consumer and gov’t/enterprise segments). On a quarterly 
basis, Q2 revenue increased by 1.1% YoY / 4.4% QoQ, while net profit 
increased by 5.7% YoY / 9.1% QoQ. GPM declined sequentially to 39%, mainly 
due to unfavorable product mix (i.e., lower contribution from high-margin carrier 
segment). NPM improved sequentially to 9.4% (vs. 9% / 7.5% in 1Q24/FY23) in 
2Q24 on operating cost optimization. Looking forward, we think non-carrier 
segments will maintain double-digit growth, offsetting the weakness in carrier 
business. The stock is currently trading at 11.9x 2024E P/E. Maintain BUY, 
with adjusted TP at RMB32.86. 
 The carrier segment faced headwinds as domestic telecom companies 
become disciplined in capital expenditures, as the built-out of the 5G 
network in China has already achieved significant milestone. The aggregate 
capex of China telcos is projected to be RMB334bn in 2024 (down 5% YoY), 
with the investment focus shifting to computing power/industrial 
digitalization/cloud markets, in line with our previous expectations (report). 
Given RAN business accounted for more than half of ZTE’s carrier business 
sales, the Company's carrier revenue fell by 8.6% YoY to RMB37.3bn in 
1H24. Carrier’s GPM remained strong at 54.3% in 1H24 (vs. 54.4%/44.2% 
in 1H/2H23). Overall, the Company’s GPM was stable at 40.5% in 1H24 (vs. 
41.5% in 2023). 
 Consumer and govt/enterprise saw significant growth (14.3%/56% YoY), 
offsetting the weakness in carrier business. Consumer sales grew on robust 
demand on FTTR market and recovering consumer electronics demand. 
Govt/enterprise revenue growth was driven by a surge in server and 
memory storage sales, however, these relatively low-margin products put 
pressure on the segment’s GPM (21.8% in 1H24 vs. 34.9% in 2023). 
Looking forward, we expect these segments will maintain decent growth, as 
the spending of consumer and enterprises may continue to recover. 
 Maintain BUY on ZTE. TP adjusted to RMB32.86, based on 15x FY24E 
P/E, which equals to its 3-year historical avg. We revised down our 
revenue forecasts by 3%/2% for FY24/25E, given continuous headwinds 
from domestic telecom market (lower spending in RAN). We trimmed net 
profit forecasts by 3%/7% on lower GPM but partially offsetting by better 
operating efficiency. Potential downside risks include 1) Sino-US trade 
tensions, 2) softer capex of domestic telcos and overseas 5G deployment 
delays, 3) weaker-than-expected consumer/enterprises’ spending.
