WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
Impressive order growth despite geopolitical 
uncertainties  
 
WuXi AppTec reported 1H24 revenue of RMB17.24bn, down 8.6% YoY, 
attributable recurring net profit of RMB4.41bn, down 8.3% YoY, and attributable 
adjusted non-IFRS net profit of RMB4.37bn, down 14.2% YoY. 1H24 revenue / 
attributable adjusted non-IFRS net income accounted for 45.3%/ 46.0% of our 
2024 full-year estimates and 43.8%/ 44.7% of Bloomberg consensus, both of 
which were largely in line with its historical range. The non-COVID D&M revenue 
(within the Chemistry segment) experienced a slight decline of 2.7% YoY in 
1H24, following a relatively high base in 1H23. Notably, WuXi AppTec’s backlog, 
excluding COVID-19 commercial projects, increased by 33.2% YoY in 1H24, 
indicating strong customer demand amid geopolitical uncertainties. Mgt. has 
reiterated its revenue guidance of RMB38.3-40.5bn for 2024, forecasting YoY 
growth of 2.7% to 8.6% for revenues excluding COVID-19 commercial projects. 
Mgt. expects the adjusted non-IFRS net profit margin to align with the 2023 
level. 
 Impressive order growth driven by solid demand. As of June 2024, WuXi 
AppTec's backlog reached RMB43.1bn, marking a robust YoY increase of 
33.2% excluding COVID-19 commercial projects. Revenue from its global 
Top20 pharmaceutical clients reached RMB6.59bn, contributing 38.2% of 
the total revenue and increasing by 11.9% YoY excluding COVID-19 
commercial projects. Mgt. highlighted that over 80% of the backlog was 
expected to convert into revenue within the next 18 months, which should 
alleviate market concerns about clients' early bookings due to geopolitical 
considerations (with the ATU segment being an exception). Additionally, 
mgt. indicated that new orders signed in 1H24 increased by ~25% YoY. The 
strong order growth demonstrates the resilient demand for WuXi AppTec's 
high-quality services, indicating a positive outlook for FY25 growth. 
 TIDES business continued to be a major growth engine. Revenue of 
TIDES business reached RMB2.08bn in 1H24, demonstrating robust YoY 
growth of 57.2%, following a significant 64.4% YoY increase in 2023. As of 
June 2024, the TIDES backlog grew substantially by 147% YoY. In January 
2024, the Company’s new peptide production facilities commenced 
operation, which expanded its total capacity to 32,000 liters, positioning the 
Company as a leader in global TIDES CDMO. With the robust backlog and 
readily available production capacity, mgt. expects TIDES revenue to grow 
by over 60% YoY in 2024 and to maintain the strong momentum in 2025. 
Our model projects TIDES revenue to exceed RMB8.6bn in 2025, 
contributing ~20% to WuXi AppTec’s total revenue, a significant increase 
from ~4% in 2022. 
 Maintain BUY. Factoring in the positive trend of customer demand, we lift 
our TP from RMB53.23 to RMB54.27 (based on a 10-year DCF model with 
WACC of 10.38% and terminal growth of 2.0%). We forecast revenue to 
grow by -4.4%/ +10.9%/ +10.8% YoY and adjusted non-IFRS net income to 
grow by -8.3%/ +11.6%/ +12.1% YoY in 2024E/ 25E/ 26E, respectively.
