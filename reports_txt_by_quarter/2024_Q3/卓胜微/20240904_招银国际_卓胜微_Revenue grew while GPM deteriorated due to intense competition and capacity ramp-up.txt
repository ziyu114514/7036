CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Maxscend (300782 CH) 
 
 
 
Revenue grew while GPM deteriorated due to 
intense competition and capacity ramp-up 
 
Maxscend reported 1H24 results. Revenue grew 37% YoY to RMB2.3bn from a low 
base in 1H23, driven by clients’ restocking behavior. GPM declined to 42.1%, down 
6.9ppt from 1H23. Margin erosion was mainly due to 1) an unfavorable revenue mix 
towards higher module sales, 2) ramp up in fab production and 3) intensified 
competition. Despite a slow recovery in consumer demand and prolonged 
replacement cycle of handsets, we expect Maxscend to outperform its peers, with 
its unique fab-lite model to support 1) supply chain security, 2) better product 
performance and 3) potential in cost optimization once utilization reaches a higher 
level. Maintain BUY with adj. TP at RMB100. 
 We remain optimistic that Maxscend’s module business will drive future 
growth. By segment, discrete products revenue grew 15% YoY in 1H24, while 
module products grew 81% YoY. Module revenue contribution increased 
steadily from 29%/36% in 2022/23 to 45% in 1H24. We expect module sales to 
grow further by 37%/30% YoY in 2024/25E, driven by the modulization trend in 
RFFE sector. We hold a positive outlook for Maxscend with the company’s 
recent development in filters, which will enhance Maxscend’s capabilities in 
meeting clients’ customization and miniaturization requirements that eventually 
lead to market share gains.  
 We see domestic RFFE suppliers are all facing ASP pressures from a 
deteriorating industry environment, as competition gets intensified. 
However, we think the impact will be mitigated eventually as the sector 
continues to consolidate. In addition, Maxscend is increasing its high-end 
product coverage with its own fabrication capacities. Looking forward, the 
launch of new products will be in focus. We think new product ramp-up will 
weigh on GPM in the near term. We project overall GPM to be 41.9%/42.2% for 
2024/25E. 
 Maintain BUY rating. We cut 2024/25E earnings forecasts by 31%/27% on 
GPM pressure from longer-than-expected price war. TP is trimmed to RMB100, 
based on 44.5x 2025E P/E, which is 1SD below 1-year hist. avg. fwd. P/E, given 
near-term GPM pressures and uncertainties in mobile recovery. We think 
Maxscend will be a key beneficiary of the semiconductor localization trend in 
China. Despite a challenging market, the company’s growth story is intact, in 
our view. Its fabrication capabilities will serve as a pillar stone for its long-term 
development.
