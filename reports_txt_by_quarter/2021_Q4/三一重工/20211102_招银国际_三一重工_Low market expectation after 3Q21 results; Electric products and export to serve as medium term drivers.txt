We believe the 3Q21 earnings (-35% YoY) has set a low base and expectations 
for the coming quarters, suggesting that further significant downside on valuation 
should be limited. In the near term, we expect a risk reduction driver will come 
from the stabilization of gross margin as sharp increase raw material price and 
freight rate from the current high level looks less likely. Besides, the speed-up of 
local government bond will help improve the machinery demand in China market. 
In the medium term, SANY has set to become a global tier-one player, on the 
back of clear roadmap on overseas expansion, fast growing electric products and 
cutting edge technology in intelligent production. Maintain BUY and TP of RMB30, 
based on 14x 2021E PE.  
 Clear roadmap on overseas expansion. According to SANY, the Company 
currently ranks No. 5 in the global market (excluding China). SANY not only 
ranks No.1 in 15 countries (major country: Indonesia), but also ranks No.2 in 
India, Chile and Philippine. Besides, SANY has already achieved 5% market 
share in each the countries including Russia, Canada, France, UK and New 
Zealand. Going forward, SANY will continue to put the focus not only on the 
developing regions but also the developed regions such as Europe and US. 
SANY plans to build lighthouse factories in Europe to in order to ensure 
production and delivery, reduce cost and promote the brand. Besides, SANY 
has already established leasing companies in the US, and plans to set up 
leasing companies in Germany, UK, Italy and Canada.  
 Overseas sales target. SANY’s excavator sales in overseas surged 1.33x 
YoY in 9M21, significantly outpaced the industry growth of 49%. SANY targets 
to achieve 1.2-1.3x YoY growth in 2021E, followed by >50% YoY in 2022E. 
For crane machinery (overseas), SANY targets to achieve ~5% YoY in 2022E.    
 Excavator sales in China better than industry. SANY’s excavator sales in 
China grew 13% YoY in 9M21, with 3ppt market share gain YoY (+1.4ppt for 
large & medium size; +4ppt for small size). Sales weakness in 3Q21 was 
mainly due to the weak demand for medium size models, as a result of 
sluggish property sector. SANY targets to achieve 8-10% growth this year.  
 Aggressive target of electric concrete mixer sales. The carbon reduction 
targets in China have triggered significant increase in procurement for electric 
mixers from the local governments. SANY delivered ~850 units of electric 
mixer in 10M21. SANY plans to achieve 1.2k units (equivalent to RMB0.8-
1.0bn revenue) in 2021E. Going forward, SANY targets to deliver 
RMB4bn/8bn/10bn revenue from electric mixer in 2022E/23E/25E.

 Lighthouse factories construction in good progress. SANY has completed the 
construction of 14 lighthouse factories (i.e. smart factories). Another seven plants 
are under construction and most of those who will be completed in 1H22E.  
 Recap on 3Q21 results. Net profit dropped 35% YoY to RMB2.5bn, which is better 
than our expectation. Revenue dropped only 13% YoY to RMB20.8bn, due to 
strong export sales. Gross margin narrowed 5.5ppt YoY / 1.8ppt QoQ to 24.9%. 
R&D expense grew 4.5% YoY to RMB1.3bn and SANY targets to maintain a 
spending of RMB1.3-1.6bn for each quarter going forward. Operating cash inflow
