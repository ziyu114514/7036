We expect Hengli’s production plan in Oct will be affected by the current power 
shortage, resulting in a slower-than-expected sales recovery in 4Q21E. We trim 
our earnings forecast in 2021E by 8%, to reflect lower volume and margin 
assumptions. We also revise down our earnings forecast by 4% each year in 
2022E/23E to reflect our more conservative margin assumptions. Our TP is 
revised down from RMB103 to RMB86, based on 42x 2021E P/E which is 
equivalent to the historical average (previous target P/E: 46x). Maintain HOLD.      
 Scheduled production in Oct is affected by power shortage. Hengli has 
scheduled production volume of 66k units of excavator hydraulic cylinder in 
Oct (up only 5% YoY but down 6% MoM), which is below our expectation. 
Scheduled production volume of large & medium size pump/valves also 
slowed to 8%/19% growth (YoY) in Oct. The conservative production plan is 
due to the uncertainties arising from power suspension. 
 3Q21E earnings preview. Hengli will report the 3Q21E results on 25 Oct. We 
forecast net profit to slightly drop 3% YoY to RMB471mn, due to margin 
contraction that offset the revenue growth of 13%.   
 New business initiatives to drive diversification in terms of product 
offerings and international expansion. Hengli is planning for a placement 
with a fund-raising size of RMB5bn (max). The proceeds will be mainly spent 
on the capacity expansion in Mexico (to support the global leading excavator 
manufacturer), as well as the new capacity of linear actuator for electric 
cylinder (a new area for potential import substitution). We are positive to 
Hengli’s new business initiatives, given the excellent track record of achieving 
import substitution in the hydraulic cylinder, pump and valve.      
 Upside risks: (1) Fast recovery of power supply; (2) better-than-expected 
excavator 
demand. 
Downside 
risks: (1) 
Continuous 
slowdown 
of 
construction activities; (2) longer-than-expected power suspension (3) risk of 
overseas expansion.
