 3Q21 earnings beat. Tigermed reported 3Q21 revenue/attributable net profit 
of RMB1,339mn/RMB526mn (up by 58%/65% YoY), adding up 9M21 revenue 
/attributable net profit to RMB3,395mn/RMB1,781mn, which accounted for 
78%/ 84% of our full-year estimate. Attributable recurring net profit of 3Q21 
grew 68% YoY to RMB326mn while that of 9M21 increased 75% YoY to 
RMB869mn, accounting for 75% of our full-year estimate. Tigermed booked 
RMB1,117mn fair value gains and RMB125mn investment gains in 9M21, 
totaling 53% of its pre-tax profit during the same period. Gross margin 
retreated from 48.5% in 9M20 to 46.8% in 9M21, due to increased revenue 
from overseas clinical trial solution services, and RMB appreciation (note that 
some of Tigermed’s revenue are booked in USD while cost of services are 
incurred in RMB). 
 Strong backlog growth momentum boding well for revenue growth. 
During 9M21, Tigermed’s new orders reached a YoY growth of over 100%, 
compared with 151% YoY growth in 1H21. The strong new orders growth was 
mainly driven by strong demand in COVID-19 vaccine clinical trial services. 
Management indicated that Tigermed booked COVID-19 related revenue of 
RMB200m (representing 15% to total quarterly revenue) in 3Q21 and 
expected to book approximately additional RMB200mn COVID-19 related 
revenue in 4Q21E. Meanwhile, non-COVID-19 new orders also continued 
strong growth given the management expects 40-50% YoY growth in non-
COVID-19 related new orders in full-year of 2021, laying a solid foundation for 
near-term revenue growth. 
 Enhancing global competence by riding on the COVID-19 R&D wave. The 
worldwide pandemic has created good opportunities for Tigermed to quickly 
access global market. Tigermed assisted Chinese vaccine developers to 
conduct global clinical trials in various countries such as Brazil, Chile and 
South Africa, paving the way for the Company to exploit further business 
opportunities in these countries. According to management, Tigermed clinical 
services have now covered more than 20 new countries. We also expect 
Tigermed to further enhance its global presence by M&As. Meanwhile, with its 
strengthening global capabilities, Tigermed is better positioned to provide 
services for foreign clients to conduct clinical trials in China. 
 Maintain BUY. We revised up our FY21E/ 22E/ 23E attributable net profit 
forecasts by 7/ 18%/ 21% to reflect the strong growth outlook. We lifted our 
new DCF-based TP from RMB198.40 to RMB212.59 (WACC: 9.84%, 
Terminal growth: 3.0%).
