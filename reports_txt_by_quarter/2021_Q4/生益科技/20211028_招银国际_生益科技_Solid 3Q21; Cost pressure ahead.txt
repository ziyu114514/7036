Shengyi Tech released 3Q21 results with revenue of RMB5.5bn (45.5% YoY) 
and net profit of RMB925mn (93.9% YoY), largely in-line with its preannounced 
earnings earlier. We believe Shengyi’s solid results confirmed the strong demand 
for both CCL (56.6% YoY) and PCB (26.8% QoQ). However, 3Q gross margin 
was down vs 1H21, suggesting difficulty in further transferring the material cost 
pressure to downstream clients. We revised up FY21-22E EPS by 6-16% but 
slightly adjusted TP to RMB30.50 with lower target multiple (22.5x vs. previous 
25x FY22E P/E). Maintain BUY.  
 Positive outlook for FY21E-22E CCL sales supported by strong demand; 
cost pressure may challenge GPM ahead. Due to pent-up demand for CCL 
from several end markets (auto, consumer, etc.), Shengyi reported strong 
sales during 9M21. Revenue grew at 59.8% YoY, however, GPM reduced to 
~26% in 3Q21 (vs. 29.3% in 1H21). The results are largely in line with our 
previous view of “another strong quarter in Q3” but uncertainty is rising given 
“limited room for CCL suppliers to increase ASP” (Link). We think the 
Company had less ASP adjustment in Q3 although material cost continued 
to rise (LME 3M copper price rebounded to US$10k/ton last week). Looking 
forward, we believe momentum for CCL will continue on strong demand. 
However, short-term uncertainty still exists, such as cost pressure and further 
power shortage. 
 PCB segment started to recover with improved GPM. We saw its PCB 
segment recovered in 3Q21, with 26.8% QoQ revenue growth. Major reasons 
include 1) 5G deployment resumed in 3Q21 and 2) contribution from new 
capacity in Ji’an factory (37k sq m/month). PCB GPM has also increased to 
21.3% (vs. 16.0% in Q2) but still negatively affected by high material price 
pressure, compared to GPM of 29.6% in 3Q20. We believe PCB business 
will continue to recover but high cost pressure will remain as an overhang. 
 Maintain BUY and slightly adjusted TP to RMB30.50. Our new TP of 
RMB30.50 is based on lowered 22.5x FY22 P/E (vs previous 25x due to 
limited CCL ASP upside). Although GPM may face continuous challenge, we 
saw net margin was steadily improving. Trading at 16.6x FY22E P/E, the 
stock remains attractive. Potential risks include less-than-expected transfer 
of material costs and less-than-expected market demand.

Sector outlook remains positive despite short-term power 
shortage 
Prismark raised 2021E full-year growth forecast for PCB industry again to 18.2% 
(8.6%/14.0% in 4Q20/1Q21), driven by the widespread economic recovery as the 
pandemic is controlled and there is strong consumer demand. They believe Japan and 
China will outperform their global peers.

Source: CMBIS estimates 
In 1H21, Shengyi Tech has experienced fast growth in its CCL business (a key material of 
PCB) due to the pent-up demand from consumer and auto market. Meanwhile, given that 
material prices (especially the copper) remain at their highs, the ASP of Shengyi’s CCL 
products has increased ~30% in 1H21, successfully transferred the material price to 
downstream PCB manufacturer. However, its PCB segment has a much weaker 
performance due to the delayed 5G deployment this year. The ASP has dropped as the 
telecom products have a higher average price.

Figure 8: Shengyi’s PCB sales volume vs. ASP 
 
Source: Company data, CMBIS estimates 
We expect material prices to remain at their highs in near-term given that 1) recovery of 
global economy will continue; 2) low copper inventory in China and 3) government 
intervention (suppressing market price from its equilibrium) which increases buyer’s 
intention to stock up material inventories but curbs suppliers’ willingness to sell.

There were several waves of material price increase in 1H21 to reflect the rising costs. 
Shengyi’s CCL price has increased ~30% in 1H21. The room for further price rise will be 
less. For 2H21, the market is conservative, given concerns of 1) sluggish consumer growth, 
2) uncertainty in macroeconomic environment, 3) reducing demand in low margin market 
suppressed by high material price and 4) potential impact from power shortage starting 
from late 3Q21.  
Currently, Shengyi’s CCL capacity is about 680-700w sq m per month. Due to the high 
order volume in 1H21, the capacity utilization is very full in certain months. The auto market 
has the longest order visibility (60-90 days). New CCL capacity includes 1) 11mn sq m in 
Changsu, Jiangsu (expected to begin production in Sept./Oct. 2022), 2) 2.6mn sq m in 
Dongguan, Guangdong (expected to begin production in Sept./Oct. 2022) and 3) 7.4mn sq 
m in Shanxi (expected to begin production in 1Q22). New PCB capacity includes 35w sq 
m in Dongguan, Guangdong (expected to begin production in 2H22).

Overall, we are still positive in Shengyi’s future performance. As the second largest CCL 
provider in the world, we believe the Company is capable to adjust its product structure to 
1) transfer the material cost better than its peers and 2) maintain its capacity utilization at 
high level.

However, near-term uncertainty still exists. Currently the power shortage has limited impact 
on the Company, but the situation may get worse as cold weather has come. Meanwhile, 
as material prices are still at their highs, continuous cost pressure may challenge the 
Company’s GPM ahead.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with new TP at RMB30.50 (36% upside)  
We maintain BUY rating with TP of RMB30.50 based on the trimmed 22.5x FY22E P/E. 
We lowered the valuation given that the transfer of cost pressure slowed down in 3Q21 but 
material prices, especially copper, are still at their highs. We expect the momentum will 
continue and PCB business will steadily recover, but near-term cost pressure will remain 
as the biggest overhang. 
Potential risks include less-than-expected transfer of material costs and less-than-expected 
market demand.
