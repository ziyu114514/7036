Hikvision reported in-line FY3Q21 with revenue/ operating profit growth of +22%/ 
24% YoY respectively. Innovative business growth remained strong at +53% YoY 
with revenue contribution reaching 17%. Although power cut impact is limited as 
Hikvision has high inventory on hand (FY3Q21 inventory +26% QoQ), weakening 
macro environment could weigh on FY22E growth outlook. Maintain BUY with 
lowered target price of RMB76.25 (prior RMB79.62).   
 Resilient FY3Q21. Hikvision reported in-line FY3Q21. Revenue was at 
RMB21.7bn (+22% YoY) and net profit was at RMB4.5bn (+18% YoY). 
Excluding the time-lag of tax credit impact (recorded earlier in 2Q this year), 
operating profit grew at +24% YoY on higher GPM (+1.5 pct pts YoY to 46.4%). 
 Demand: Innovative business remained strong, property sector 
weakness to be reflected in FY2H22. Hikvision products cover 70 industries 
now as camera applications expanded by embedding AI/ sensor technology. 
Innovative businesses (smart home products/ robotics/ industrial cameras, 
etc.) continued to gain shape with revenue growth of +53% YoY to RMB3.7bn 
in FY3Q21, contributing 17% of revenue. Regarding weakening macro 
environment, as it is turning more difficult to acquire new land and newly 
started construction area has been declining in China, EBG business could 
be negatively affected in FY2H22. 
 Supply: Record-high inventory level to minimize power cut risk. As we 
flagged before, there is no direct impact from power cut to Hikvision production 
plants although some upstream component suppliers were being affected. 
Hikvision maintained a high-inventory level strategy and expanded the 
supplier list to minimize the potential risk. In FY3Q21, Hikvision inventory level 
came to a record high of RMB19.1bn (+71% YoY, +26% QoQ). Inventory as % 
of sales was at 0.88, still lower than the level in 1Q20 at 1.32 (Hikvision being 
added to entity list in Oct 2019).  
 Maintain BUY. We cut FY21-23E net profit by 2-5% to reflect lower sales 
(macro to affect SMBG business) and lower margin on higher logistics cost 
and R&D. Maintain BUY with new target price of RMB76.25 (prior RMB79.62), 
based on unchanged 36x FY22 P/E. Key downside risks include raw material 
shortage that could last for longer time, higher logistic cost and weaker than 
expected demand.

Valuation  
Hikvision (002415 CH, BUY, TP RMB76.25) 
We cut target price to RMB76.25 (prior RMB79.62), based on unchanged 36x FY22 P/E, 
50% above its 3-year mean. We believe Hikvision deserves re-rating as supply chain risk 
is mitigated after two years of product re-design, new growth drivers (AI) in enterprise 
segment is emerging and gross margin continues to expand. Also, Hikvision announced 
plan to spin-off its smart home business (Ezviz Network) on STAR board. We believe the 
spin-off could provide new financing channel to support IoT/ AI R&D.
