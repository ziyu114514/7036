Shennan reported 3Q21 results with revenue of RMB3.9bn (26% YoY) and net 
profit of RMB4.7mn (25% YoY). GPM was stable at 24.6% in 3Q (vs 24.5% in 
2Q), while NPM improved QoQ to 12.0% (vs 10.1% in 2Q). We believe both 
domestic and overseas communications service providers (CSP) capex 
contributed to the strong revenue growth. We think 3Q may be the best quarter 
of the year as 4Q demand could be difficult to keep up. With material price still at 
their highs, we remain conservative for Shennan. Maintain HOLD and TP 
adjusted to RMB110.75.  
 Strong 3Q21 results driven by domestic/overseas 5G investments. 
Shennan’s 3Q revenue grew 26.3%/22.8% YoY/QoQ, largely driven by its 
PCB business (majority is from telecom market). China telcos resumed their 
3rd batch 5G tender in 3Q. We estimate 5G BTS net-add will reach 692k in 
2021 (200k 700MHz 5G BTS to be completed within 2021), compared to 588k 
in 2020. Overseas CSP investment was another contributor. Gartner 
estimated global 5G capex will increase 39% YoY this year. Looking forward, 
we expect China 5G capex plan to maintain a similar level but overseas 5G 
investment will increase 22% YoY in 2022E. We believe Shennan will be the 
key beneficiary with revenue growth of 16.6%/15.3% YoY in 2022E/23E. 
 Material cost pressure to continue. Although Shennan managed to sustain 
its overall GPM at 24.5%, we think the cost pressure will continue. Copper 
price has slipped slightly from recent new high but remains at US$9.5k/ton 
(as of 1/11/2021). With low domestic copper inventory, we believe material 
cost will remain an overhang. However, Shennan has improved its 
profitability with better operating efficiency, and NPM increased to 12.0% in 
3Q from 8.9%/10.1% in 1Q/2Q.  
 Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB110.75. We slightly raised our TP to 
RMB110.75 based on same 30.0x FY22E P/E. We think 3Q could be the best 
quarter and demand will slightly ease in 4Q. We maintain HOLD given 
uncertainty in economy growth, elevated material cost and constraints in 
supply chain. Potential upside risks include faster-than-expected decline of 
material costs, higher-than-expected 5G infrastructure spending and 
consumer demand.

Company update 
In 1H21, Shennan’s PCB business has declined 14% YoY, due to the delay of 5G BTS 
deployment in China. As soon as 3rd batch 5G tender resumed, Shennan’s 3Q revenue 
grew 26.3%/22.8% YoY/QoQ. Meanwhile, demand from overseas was also strong. Gartner 
estimated global 5G capex will increase 39% YoY this year. However, we think demand in 
4Q is difficult to keep up with strong number delivered in 3Q considering the uncertainty in 
economy growth, elevated material cost, constraints in supply chain. 
Looking forward, we expect 5G Capex plan to maintain at a similar level in 2022E, given 
the de-spec trend in 5G BTS. For example, lower frequency spectrum equipment 
accounted for the majority of 5G BTS tender this year (2021: 700MHz/2.1GHz, vs. 2020: 
2.6GHz/3.5GHz). PCB growth will be largely driven by oversea 5G investment, which is 
expected to grow at 22% in 2022 according to Gartner. Substrate business will continue to 
deliver strong results as its Wuxi factory has entered the mid-to-late stage of ramp-up 
process.  
Shennan’s PCB capacity was about 200w sq m per year. The capacity of the Company’s 
PCB production was ~80-85% in 1H21. The recent power shortage has not affected the 
Company’s operation, but its PCB production line will not reach full capacity in 2H21. New 
PCB capacity includes 1) Phase II plant in Nantong, Jiangsu (58w sq m, currently ramping 
up in the mid-to-late stage) and 2) Phase III plant in Nantong, Jiangsu (expected to begin 
production in 4Q22). Substrate capacity was 30w per year. New substrate capacity 
includes 1) Wuxi, Jiangsu (60w, high-end substrate, currently ramping up in the mid-to-late 
stage) and 2) Guangzhou, Guangdong (expected to begin production in 2023). 
Figure 5: Capacity Schedule 
   
Source: Company data, CMBIS estimates 
Shennan announced to expand substrate capacity in Guangzhou production base, which 
will add 200mn FC-BGA and 3mn panel RF/FC-CSP substrate capacity. We expect the 
new project to contribute revenue in 2023/24E. Shennan’s existing substrate capacity has 
been in full production since last year, driven by strong semiconductor demand. We believe 
strong substrate revenue will continue into 2H21E, driving 22.5% YoY growth in FY21E. 
The structural change of product mix will help to improve profitability but will be partially 
offset by the high material costs. Copper price has slipped slightly from the recent new high 
but remains at US$9.5k/ton (as of 1/11/2021). With low domestic copper inventory, we 
maintain a conservative view.

Valuation  
Maintain Hold with new TP at RMB110.75 (13% upside)  
We slightly raised our TP to RMB110.75 based on the same 30.0x FY22E P/E. We think 
3Q could be the best quarter and demand will slight ease in 4Q. We maintain HOLD rating 
given uncertainty in economy growth, elevated material cost and constraints in supply chain. 
Potential upside risks include faster-than-expected decline of material costs, higher-than-
expected 5G infrastructure spending and consumer demand. Potential downside risks 
include continued price increase in upstream materials and slower-than-expected 5G 
deployment.
