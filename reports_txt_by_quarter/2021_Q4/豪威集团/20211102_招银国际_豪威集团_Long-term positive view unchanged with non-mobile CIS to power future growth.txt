Willsemi released 3Q21 results. Rev./NP of RMB5.9bn/1.3bn (-1.0%/73.1% YoY), 
largely in-line with preannouncement of net profit earlier, due to weak smartphone 
sales and supply chain constraints. Considering underlying negative factors 
which would last longer, we revised down our FY21E-23E rev. forecasts, but 
raised margin est. due to improved product mix. We remain positive on Willsemi 
and believe its non-mobile CIS business will maintain strong momentum and 
power the company’s future growth. Maintain BUY rating with TP slightly 
adjusted to RMB346.6, given expected weak performance in global smartphone 
sales and fast growth seen in non-mobile CIS business. 
 3Q mobile CIS business was challenging; new products will help gain 
market share in FY22E. 3Q global smartphone shipment declined by 6% YoY 
(Counterpoint) due to component shortage and weak consumer demand. 
Stronger sales were observed in mid- to high-end models (evidenced by 
recovering Sony’s CIS sales in 3Q). Although we hold a neutral view on 
smartphone market growth into 2022, especially for non-Apple brands, we 
believe Willsemi can still gain share (in RMB1k-2k and RMB3k+ models) with 
its new 50MP/100MP/200MP products. 
 GPM improved to 35.5% as non-mobile CIS accounted for 50% of 3Q CIS 
sales. Non-mobile CIS continued lifting Company’s profitability. GPM 
improved to 35.5% (vs. 29.9%/33.7% in 2020/2Q21). We believe the trend is 
sustainable with rapid growth in auto, AR/VR segments. We are positive on 
Willsemi’s auto CIS business considering the growth from both surging market 
demand and increasing market share. Auto CIS market is experiencing a 
similar path of smartphone, with higher ASP/quantity. Willsemi is closing its 
market share gap with On semi. We expect to see continuous strong growth 
in its auto CIS business despite the prolonged chip shortage issue. 
 Maintain BUY rating with revised TP of RMB346.6 based on 50x FY22E 
P/E. We cut our FY21E-23E revenue forecast by 8%-16%, considering weak 
estimates of global smartphone sales and prolonged supply chain constraints. 
Meanwhile, we raised our margin estimates by 1pt-1.3pt due to improved 
product mix. Potential upsides include: 1) faster-than-expected ease of supply 
chain constraints; 2) new device/killer app released in VR/AR. Potential risks 
include: 1) worse-than-expected global economy that curbs consumer 
spending and 2) overhung chip shortage led to unfilled demand.

CIS: non-mobile CIS will maintain strong momemtum while 
smartphone market is weak 
Weak smartphone sales in FY21E; expect modest mobile CIS growth 
in FY22E 
Full year smartphone shipment forecast has been cut to 1.41bn units (6% YoY) from 
previous 1.45bn units (9%), according to Counterpoint. The shipment rebounded in 3Q20 
after the logistic resumed from COVID-19 disruption, but was negatively affected again in 
2Q21 due to semiconductor shortage. The situation got worse in 3Q21 before peak season. 
Canalys’s estimated global smartphone shipment for the third quarter was a 6% YoY 
decline.  
Looking forward, we expect Q4 shipment will have some sequential recovery during the 
holidays. However, we do not expect the rebound will be significant given 1) continued 
semi shortage, 2) increasing cost of certain components and 3) ASP pressure from peers 
(the discount this year will not be aggressive as Apple did not raise the price of its new 13 
series).

(2021E) lowered to 6% YoY from previous 9% YoY

CMBIS estimates 
* Samsung/ Xiaomi/ Oppo/ vivo/ Honor (1Q20 to 3Q21) 
Given the recent weak smartphone sales, the market is conservative in mobile CIS market 
growth given that 1) the constraints of smartphone sales will not ease in near-term (such 
as semi shortage, power shortage, rising foundry costs, etc.), 2) the mobile camera 
shipment was sluggish since 2Q21 driven by slower penetration of triple-/quad-cameras in 
latest models of smartphones and 3) the de-spec concern.  
We have studied 289 latest models (released from 1Q20-3Q21) from the top Andriod 
brands, including Samsung/ Xiaomi/ Oppo/ vivo/ Honor, we did see the trend of slowing 
down penetration of multi-cameras. We think the main reason is the increasing bill of 
materials (“BOM”) that put a lot of pressure on smartphone makers. It is a mixed result from 
1) smartphone upgrade (rising cost due to additional frequency coverage, better camera 
resolution, larger storage, etc.), 2) tight supply chain and 3) peers pressure such as new 
pricing strategy of Apple series 13.  
These headwinds are likely to continue into 1H22E. Although we hold a neutral view on 
smartphone market growth into 2022, especially for non-Apple brands, we believe Willsemi

can still gain share (in RMB1k-2k and RMB3k+ models) with its new 50MP/100MP/200MP 
products. The Company is deeply engaged with Chinese mobile manufacturers and will 
ride the tailwind of their market expansions (Oppo/vivo/Honor). We saw the Company’s 
mobile CIS products has penetrated into rear main cameras since last year. Based on the 
study of 289 latest models, we found their CIS products in certain Xiaomi/Oppo/Huawei’s 
models. One interesting thing to note is that these models released in 2021 are mostly mid-
ranged and flagship models, with higher ASP compared with that of last year (mostly 
budget and mid-ranged models). The spec has also increased to 48MP/50MP/64MP this 
year (vs. 13MP/16MP/48MP in 2020). We believe the penetration will continue given the 
uncertainty of Sino-US trade tension and Willsemi’s leading market position in CIS and 
advanced technology. 
 
Auto market is also affected by chip shortage but we hold positive 
view on auto CIS market growth as the demand is certain 
Although IHS Markit has cut their forecasts for 2021E-23E light vehicle production by 
6.2%/9.3%/1.1%, the growth for 22E/23E will still be 9.3%/11.4% YoY, driven by strong 
demand for auto cameras (such as ADAS). We are very positive on auto CIS market growth 
as it is likely to replicate the path of mobile CIS with higher ASP and larger number of 
cameras per vehicle.  
We think Willsemi will be a key beneficiary of auto CIS growth. The Company currently 
provides CIS for European auto manufacturers and eyes on expansion in U.S. market. 
Willsemi has also worked closely with ADAS developers, such as Mobileye. The 
certification for auto-related production (e.g. IATF 16949) will take longer time to obtain and 
the requirements will be much stricter. Willsemi ranked as No.2 among auto CIS suppliers, 
but is closing its market share gap with On semi. We expect to see continuous strong 
growth in its auto CIS business despite the prolonged chip shortage issue.

Valuation 
Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB346.6 (30% upside) 
We maintain BUY rating and adjust our TP to RMB346.6 (based on 50x FY22E P/E). 
We cut our FY21E-23E revenue forecast by 8%-16%, considering weak estimates of global 
smartphone sales and prolonged supply chain constraints. Meanwhile, we raised our 
margin estimates by 1pt-1.3pt due to improved product mix.  
We are still positive on Willsemi. For mobile CIS, the Company is currently a leading 
supplier for main rear cameras in certain models (<RMB1k and RMB2k-3k). Although we 
hold a neutral view on smartphone market growth into 2022, especially for non-Apple 
brands, we believe Willsemi can still grow share (in RMB1k-2k and RMB3k+ models) with 
its new 50MP/100MP/200MP products. For non-mobile CIS, we believe the growth will 
come from both surging market demand and the Company’s market share as the auto CIS 
market is experiencing a similar path of smartphone, with higher ASP and quantity.

economy that curbs consumer spending and 2) overhung chip shortage led to unfilled 
demand.
