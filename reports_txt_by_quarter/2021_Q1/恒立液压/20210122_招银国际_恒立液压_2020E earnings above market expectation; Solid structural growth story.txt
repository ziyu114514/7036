Hengli’s released a positive profit alert yesterday stating that the net profit in 
2020E is expected to surge 58%-77% YoY to RMB2.05-2.30bn. The mid-point 
(RMB2.17bn) is in line with our estimate of RMB2.18bn but higher than the 
consensus of RMB2.06bn. We believe it is a positive surprise to the market. We 
revised up Hengli’s earnings forecast in 2021E/22E by 4%/6% (9%/7% above 
consensus), after revising up our sales volume assumption. We believe the next 
catalyst will come from a strong 1Q21E sales. We raise our TP to RMB143, based 
on 65x 2021E P/E (50% premium to the historical average of 43x).      
 Profit surprise in 2020E. Hengli’s net profit in 2020E is expected to surge 
58%-77% YoY to RMB2.05-2.3bn. This implies net profit of RMB575-828mn 
in 4Q20, up 52%-118% YoY. The earnings growth was driven by strong 
downstream demand (excavator) that boosted the sales of hydraulic cylinders, 
pump and valve, market share gain, as well as the reduction of SG&A expense 
ratio.  
 We forecast a solid growth of excavator demand in 2021E. For the industry 
as a whole, major manufacturers of excavator delivered sales volume of 328k 
units in 2020, up 39% YoY, according to CCMA. In 4Q20, excavator sales 
grew 61% YoY. In 2021E, we expect excavator demand to grow 10% YoY 
(industry), driven by infrastructure spending growth, continuous trend of the 
substitution of labour and wheel loaders.  
 We expect Hengli to deliver strong sales in 1Q21E. We estimate Hengli 
production volume of hydraulic cylinder (for excavator) surged 75% YoY in 
Jan. Besides, we expect the production volume of pump, valve and motor to 
remain strong. Based on our new assumptions, we forecast Hengli’s sales 
volume of hydraulic cylinder (for excavator) to grow 20% YoY in 2021E, while 
sales volume of pump and valve to grow 40% YoY.    
 Structural growth trajectory remains solid. We forecast Hengli’s market 
share in hydraulic cylinder to increase from 50% in 2020E to 59% in 2022E. 
Besides, we expect pump & valve for large-size excavators, as well as non-
standardized hydraulic components for various industries will serve as key 
drivers over the coming few years.  
 Key risks: (1) Slowdown of construction activities; (2) risk of overseas 
expansion; (3) increase in raw materials cost.

Valuation 
We raise our TP to RMB143 from RMB114.4, based on 65x 2021E P/E (50% premium to 
the historical average of 43x), up from 55x previously. We continue to believe that a 
valuation premium is justified due to improving earnings visibility. First, the competitive 
landscape is favourable for Hengli to achieve further import substitution across different 
products. Second, Hengli’s growth has become incrementally more structural rather than 
cyclical. We believe the re-rating will continue and the turning point will only emerge when 
the room of import substitution becomes limited, which we expect is less likely to happen 
in 2021E.
