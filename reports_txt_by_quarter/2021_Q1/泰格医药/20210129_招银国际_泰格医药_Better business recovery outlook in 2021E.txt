 Earnings beat in 2020. Tigermed announced positive profit alert that its 
attributable net profit in 2020 rallied 100-115% YoY to RMB1,683-1,810mn 
(higher than our estimate of 90% YoY growth), and attributable recurring net 
profit grew 20-33% YoY to RMB670-742mn (vs our estimate of 23% YoY 
growth). Tigermed recognized RMB1.0-1.1bn one-off fair value gains and 
investment gains in 2020 vs RMB283mn one-off gains in 2019. 
 Strong growth momentum continued despite challenging COVID-19 
pandemic in 2020. Recall that Tigermed’s operation was interrupted by 
COVID-19 in the first half of 2020. As the pandemic got largely controlled in 
China, clinical trial operations started to normalize from 2Q20, leading to 
recovery in Tigermed’s domestic revenue. However, the pandemic remained 
serious in overseas regions such as the US and Europe. As a result, the 
overseas CRO demand, such as data management services and Frontage's 
BIO, CMC, DMPK services, were negatively impacted. In 1H20, Tigermed 
received 42% of total revenue from overseas and 40% of gross profit from 
overseas. We forecast Tigermed to register 27% YoY revenue growth in 
2H20E, accelerating from 9% YoY growth in 1H20. Looking into 2021, we 
expect the COVID-19 epidemic to gradually ease thanks to the wide 
availability of vaccines, which will drive further business recovery for Tigermed. 
We expect Tigermed’s revenue growth to accelerate to 30% YoY in 2021E 
and 28% YoY in 2022E. 
 Global expansion to drive long-term growth. Given China’s large patient 
pool, international pharmaceutical companies are including China as one site 
in MRCTs to speed up the enrollment of patients. Meanwhile, Chinese biotech 
companies are initiating more MRCTs for the purpose of product registration 
in overseas countries. Tigermed provides clinical CRO services for Chinese 
innovative drugs to go global and multinational enterprises’ drugs to enter 
Chinese market. Meanwhile, we expect Tigermed to further expand its 
overseas business network to become a clinical CRO company with global 
operations. The Company already has established networks in Asia Pacific 
regions, while US market could be the next emphasis. 
 Maintain BUY. We raised our 2020E/21E net profit forecasts by 8.2%/0.3%, 
respectively, to factor in one-off gains and strong core business growth. We 
raised our DCF-based TP to RMB187.23 (WACC: 9.84%, Terminal growth: 
4.0%).
