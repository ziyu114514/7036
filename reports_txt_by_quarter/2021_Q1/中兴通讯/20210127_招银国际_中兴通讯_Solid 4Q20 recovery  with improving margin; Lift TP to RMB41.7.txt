ZTE announced FY20 preliminary results with revenue/net profit growth of +11.7% 
/-15.3% YoY, largely in-line with our/consensus estimates, thanks to solid growth 
across all segments, share gain in China and improving profitability overseas. By 
4Q20, revenue/net profit grew 3%/62% YoY to RMB27.3bn/1.66bn. In a mixed 
backdrop of global 5G deployment and macro uncertainties, we believe ZTE is 
well positioned to seize the opportunities from “New Infrastructure” initiative and 
5G network upgrade amid Huawei uncertainties. We slightly revised our forecasts 
and raised our TP to RMB41.7 based on same 31.2x FY21E P/E. Catalysts 
include 5G BTS tenders and 2021 operator capex budget.  
 FY20 largely in-line; Solid growth across all segments. Despite 
challenges from COVID-19 and macro uncertainties, ZTE achieved sales 
growth of 11.7% YoY in FY20E, driven by solid growth from both domestic 
and overseas markets and all three business segments (carrier’s network, 
consumer business and government/corporate business). Net profit declined 
15.3% YoY in FY20, mainly due to one-time asset disposal gain in 3Q19.  
 Improving operating and financial metrics. ZTE reported record-high 
operating cashflow of RMB10.23bn in FY20E, up 37.4% YoY, while gearing 
ratio improved to 69.5% from 73.1% in FY19. We believe ZTE will continue 
to improve its working capital and optimize balance sheet structure. 
 Major beneficiary of global 5G deployment. As we believe Chinese 
operators will kick off next 5G BTS tender in 1Q21E, we expect 5G BTS net-
adds to reach 800k/1mn (including CBN) in FY21E/22E and ZTE’s 5G market 
share in China will gradually ramp to 35% (vs 30% in FY20). Thanks to global 
economic recovery and resumption of 5G BTS rollout post COVID-19, we 
expect domestic/overseas revenue from carrier’s network to grow at 9%/18% 
CAGR during FY21-23E.  
 Reiterate BUY; Lift TP to RMB41.7. We adjusted our forecasts to reflect 
better operating leverage and new FX assumptions. We slightly raised our 
target price to RMB41.7 based on same 31.2x FY21E P/E, in line with 2-year 
historical forward P/E. Trading at 25.5x FY21E P/E (1-sd below 2-year avg.), 
we think the stock is attractive, vs 26% EPS FY21-23E CAGR. Risks include 
US-China disputes, component restriction and 5G deployment delays.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY and raised TP to RMB 41.7 (22.5% upside)  
We slightly raised our TP to RMB41.7 based on 31.2x FY21E P/E, in line with 2-year 
historical forward P/E. We believe this is justified as the stock has been mostly trading on 
25-37x EPS, except the period during negative earnings in 2012, 2016 and 2018. We 
estimate 26% EPS FY21-23E CAGR, backed by 11% revenue CAGR and improving GPM 
as 5G scales up. Trading at 25.5x FY21E P/E (1-sd below 2-year avg.), we think the stock 
is attractive. Risks include US-China disputes, component restriction and overseas 5G 
deployment delays.
