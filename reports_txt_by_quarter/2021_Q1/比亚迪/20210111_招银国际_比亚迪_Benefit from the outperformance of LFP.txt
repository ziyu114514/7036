BYD delivered outstanding auto sales in Dec. NEV sales reached 29K with 
flagship Han EV shipment exceeded 12k units in Dec. NEV sales volume had 
accounted for 44% of total auto sales in 2020. Looking ahead in 2021E, we still 
see several positive catalysts for BYD from 1) new DM EV model to boost sales; 
2) cooperation with DiDi to take the lead in the ride-hailing renewable cycle; 3) 
power battery capacity expansion to support EV sales; and 4) semiconductor 
segment spin-off to release business value. We revised up BYD’s TP by 31% to 
RMB293.2. Reiterate BUY rating.  
 NEV sales speeded up in Dec. BYD announced that total auto sales volume 
achieved 56K units in Dec, +30% YoY/+4%MoM.In Dec, NEV reached 29K, 
+120%YoY (NEPV 28K/+157%YoY, NECV 1K/-48%YoY). Delivery of Han 
continued to climb with a total of 12K units in Dec, up 19.6%MoM. The annual 
cumulative sales volume was 427K units/-7%YoY, in line with CMBI 
expectation. 
 China NEV sales growth to accelerate in 2021E. We expect that the sales 
volume of NEV in China will continue to rise at a high speed in 2021E. Given 
1) the strong NEV pipeline among all major OEMs; 2) the product recognition 
from retail consumers; 3) the beginning of the first round of replacement cycle 
in ride-hailing business; 4) the gradual introduction of LFP version for existing 
models, we expect the penetration rate of NEV will exceed market 
expectations. Specifically, we expect the penetration rate of NEV to reach 7% 
in 2021E, with a corresponding sales volume of 1.92mn units, representing an 
increase of 57% (1.66mn NEPV/260K NECV). 
 NEV sales volume to increase 99% in 2021E. We estimate BYD’s NEV 
market share declined to 15% in 2020, due to epidemic impacts and late 
release of new vehicle model. Starting from 2021, BYD will use a brand new 
logo and launch several new models including Qin Plus (based on the latest 
super hybrid DM-i platform), Song Pro DM, etc. We expect those measures 
will boost its NEV sales. At the to-B end, we expect the cooperation model D1 
between BYD and DiDi to take lead in the ride-hailing renewable cycle. We 
estimate D1 to have 66K units shipment in 2021E. As we believe the 
Company’s NEV sector to maintain strong recovery, we expect BYD's market 
share in NEPV to continue to rebound to 20%, and that will boost NEV sales 
volume to 364K units in 2021E, +99%YoY. We think BYD will gradually shift 
its business focus to NEV from ICE (61% vs 39% in 2021E), and maintain 
relatively 
stable

Benefit from the outperformance of LFP

 2020E earnings to reach RMB5.3bn. Given the updated sales volume and 
sales mix, we revised our net profit forecast by +1% to RMB5.3bn in 2020E. 
At the same time, we expect a more optimistic sales forecast of NEPV in 
2021E, from 300K units to 364K units. As a result, we raised our 2021E 
bottom-line by 11% to RMB7.7bn. 
 Strong LFP battery demand boost segment valuation. We revised the 
2025E P/E multiple for the power battery segment from the previous 25x to 
35x. We observe a gradual increase in the market share of the LFP battery. 
The main reasons are from two aspects: 1) driven by a sharp price cut by 
Tesla, the NEV industry has a strong demand for cost reduction, and domestic 
NEV players are facing the pressure of continuous cost reduction which lead 
to increasing LFP battery installation for new EV models; 2) BYD’s blade 
battery, taking advantage of high volume density, can reduce the cost while 
making up for the short mile range to a certain extent, which can make up for 
the shortcoming for traditional LFP’s less power density compared with 
NCM/NCA. We believe blade battery is expected to become the first choice in 
the subdivision of LFP. At present, BYD's blade battery is still in the ramp-up 
period of production capacity while accumulating certain potential demand as 
state above. We, therefore, raise the valuation multiple of the power battery 
segment to reflect a more optimistic shipment expectation. We adopted 2025E 
35x PE (compared with the previous 2025E 25x PE) to get the corresponding 
valuation of the battery sector at RMB189bn. 
 BYD semiconductor to spin off in 2021E. On 31 Dec 2020, BYD announced 
that it plans to spin off and list its holding subsidiary, BYD semiconductor. The 
main products of BYD semiconductor are IGBT modules and 3rd-generation 
semiconductor products (SiC). At present, BYD is planning to build its own 
SiC production line, which is expected to be completed in 2021E. In addition, 
BYD SiC will fully replace IGBT to increase vehicle mileage by about 10% in 
2023E. We are optimistic about BYD's technology accumulation in the field of 
vehicle-grade semiconductors. The third-generation semiconductors (GaN 
and SiC) are very suitable for high voltage devices due to their wide bandgap 
characteristics. The electronic saturation speed of GaN is high, which is 
suitable for making microwave devices. It is applied to RF front-end amplifiers 
of mobile phones, 5G base stations, and microwave radars. The main 
application areas of SiC focused on by BYD are still in the field of electronic 
control and charging piles of NEV. At the same time, with the construction of 
the 5G base station entering the accelerating stage, the demand for small 
base stations (micro base stations) is gradually released. In the future, 
equipment suppliers will adopt the design of GaN-on-SiC based on silicon 
carbide substrate as the power supply module, which can achieve higher 
power density (to avoid the large amount of heat management hardware 
required by LDMOS, thus reducing the size of the base station) to meet the 
high frequency/high power requirements of their base stations. We believe 
that after the spin-off of BYD semiconductor, it is expected to achieve further 
independent operation, so as to expand the product matrix to adapt to different 
downstream needs and open up the valuation space.

 Pending to have H-share placement. BYD submitted application materials 
for issuing additional H-share to CSRC. With reference to listing rules of both 
the H and A-share market, we think H-share issuance will have the highest 
funding raising efficiency. Boosted by current thrilling market sentiment, the 
H-A discount is at a close level. We expect BYD’s new share placement to 
have a limited pricing discount and dilution impact to EPS, and rapid 
fundraising will help BYD accelerate power battery capacity expansion to meet 
surging market demand for blade battery. We think the placement will further 
enhance BYD’s leading position in the power battery segment and boost the 
business external shipment pace, which will likely release the segment’s 
value.  
 Revise valuation; maintain BUY.  We estimate BYD is currently trading at 
2021E 6.6x NEV P/S, and 30x 2025E power battery P/E according to our 
SOTP valuation model. We think both sector’s current valuation is far behind 
corresponding peers. Based on our revised NEV sales outlook and optimistic 
NEV sales mix in total auto sales volume, we lifted 2021E NEV P/S to 9x, and 
boost power batter valuation slightly from 25x to 35x then discount back. Our 
segment valuation for Auto/power battery/semi-conductor business is 
RMB656.7/189.3/16.0bn. Applying 15% conglomerate discount, we derived 
BYD’s valuation at RMB799.9bn with TP of RMB293.2 for A-share (HK$300.0 
for H-share). Maintain BUY rating.
