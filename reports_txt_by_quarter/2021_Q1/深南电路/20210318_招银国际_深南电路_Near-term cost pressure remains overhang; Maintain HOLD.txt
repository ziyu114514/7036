We hosted a NDR call with Shennan mgmt. this week, and investors mainly 
focused on 5G telecom demand, laminate cost pressure, IDC/auto segments and 
capacity expansion. For FY20, Shennan reported revenue of RMB11.9bn (10% 
YoY) and net profit of RMB1.4bn (16% YoY), in-line with our/consensus estimates, 
mainly driven by 8%/33% YoY growth in PCB/IC substrate and 4% YoY decline 
in PCBA. Looking into 2021, we expect PCB/PCBA to grow 15%/5% thanks to 
telecom recovery and improving product mix, while IC substrate will grow at 19% 
YoY on strong demand and supply tightness. We revised down our FY21/22E 
EPS by 18/14% to reflect cost pressure and lower ASP, and adjusted our TP to 
RMB97.8 based on lower 30x FY21E P/E. Maintain HOLD. 
 
Positive outlook for PCB demand on 5G rollout recovery and improved 
product mix. With 60% telecom exposure, PCB/PCBA segment delivered 
weaker growth of +8%/-4% YoY in FY20, given slower 5G BTS build-out in 
2H20 after a strong ramp in 1H20, while IDC/auto products grew 58%/50% 
YoY. Looking into 2021, we believe PCB segment will regain its strength as 
1) China 5G deployment will reaccelerate in 1H21E (3rd batch 5G BTS 
tender in Mar-Apr) and overseas demand is recovering as COVID-19 is 
easing; 2) Nantong (2nd phase) is expected to reach its full capacity this 
year and 3) product mix will continue to improve as auto/server demand 
remains strong.  
 
Capacity expansion on track for IC substrate segment. Shennan’s IC 
substrate clients mainly come from MEMS, fingerprint sensor, memory 
segments (30%/20%+/20%+ of substrate rev). As 2020 was a big year for 
semiconductor, IC substrate segment grew 33% YoY, and we expect strong 
momentum will continue into 2021 given solid demand and recent supply 
tightness. Mgmt. expect capacity of Wuxi plant will reach full utilization in 1H22E. 
 
Maintain HOLD with new TP of RMB97.8. We trimmed FY21-22E EPS by 
14-18% for lower ASP/margin assumptions, and reduced our TP to 
RMB97.8 based on lower 30.0x FY21E P/E (vs prior 32.4x). We maintain 
HOLD and expect near-term pressure on the stock due to 1) price pressure 
on PCB de-spec for 700MHz 5G BTS and 2) rising laminate cost starting 
from late 1Q21E.  Potential risks include lower 5G CAPEX from telco and 
raw material cost hike.

Valuation  
Maintain HOLD and trim TP to RMB97.8 
We maintain HOLD and adjust TP to RMB97.8 based on lower 30.0x FY21E P/E (vs prior 
32x). Upcoming catalysts include 1) upcoming catalysts include 3rd phase of 5G BTS 
tenders and 2) operators’ 2021 capex budget.  
Risks include 1) continued price increase in upstream materials, 2) de-spec of 5G BTS and 
3) less-than-expected demand from Telecom and Datacom operators.
