Shengyi Tech announced FY20 preliminary results with revenue/net profit of 
RMB14,687mn/1,663mn, up 11%/14% YoY, and earnings is 12%/10% below 
our/consensus estimates. By 4Q20, revenue/net profit grew +6%/-11.6% YoY. 
We believe the miss is mainly due to 1) weak telecom demand on slower 5G 
deployment in 4Q20 and 2) margin pressure with copper price hike given delayed 
cost transfer to downstream clients. We cut FY20-22E estimates by 10-13% to 
reflect more conservative assumptions, and trimmed our TP to RMB29.45 based 
on same 30x FY21E P/E. We expect Shengyi’s GPM to improve in next 1-2 
quarters given that CCL price will start to rise in 1Q21E. Maintain BUY.  
 
Weaker 4Q20 due to slower 5G deployment and cost hike. With over 30% 
revenue exposure to telecom segment (2019: 30% of CCL, 47% of PCB), we 
believe the miss was mainly due to 1) weaker telecom demand with soft 5G 
BTS deployment in 4Q20, and 2) lower gross margin given delay of cost 
transfer (e.g. copper) to downstream clients. Given continued copper price 
hike, we expect Shengyi will start to raise CCL ASP in 1Q21E, and gross 
margin will gradually improve in FY21E.  
 Capacity expansion of prepreg and CCL to drive future growth. Shengyi 
announced a new project last week to add 11.4mn sq m capacity for CCL 
and 36mn m capacity for prepreg. Total investment is RMB945mn which will 
be funded by own capital or financing. Total construction period will be 15 
months, and production will start in 3Q22E. Shengyi expected new capacity 
to generate RMB1,319mn/143mn revenue/net profit each year. The new 
product lines will cover HDI, 5G communications, consumer electronics, auto 
and wearables. We believe it will help Shengyi to diversify revenue sources 
and accelerate expansion into consumer electronics and automobile markets. 
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB29.45. We trimmed our FY20-22E EPS 
by 10-13% and lower TP to RMB29.45 (same 30x FY21/P/E), reflecting more 
conservative revenue and margin assumptions. Trading at 23.8x FY21E P/E, 
close to 1-sd below historical P/E, the stock is attractive in our view. Near-
term catalysts include increase in CCL price and 5G BTS tenders. Potential 
risks include slower-than-expected transfer of material costs and delay in 5G 
upgrades.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY and lower TP to RMB29.45 (26% upside)  
We trimmed our TP to RMB29.45 based on same 30x FY21E P/E, in line with 1-year 
historical forward P/E. We believe this is justified as the stock has been mostly trading on 
26-36x EPS. We estimate 26% EPS FY20-23E CAGR, backed by 23% revenue CAGR 
given that 1) next phase of 5G tenders is believe to resume soon, 2) GPM will improve as 
CCL’s ASP is expected to increase to reflect the material cost pressure and 3) new capacity 
for pregreg/CCL/PCB and the diversification in downstream applications. Potential risks 
include slower-than-expected transfer of material costs and delay in 5G upgrades.
