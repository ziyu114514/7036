Goertek pre-announced FY20 revenue/net profit growth of 64%/123% YoY, 
which reached upper end of its prior earnings guidance (+115-125% YoY). We 
maintain our positive view on Goertek’s outlook backed by upcycle of AirPods 
/Watch/HomePod, better product mix and recovery of AR/VR demand. We raised 
FY21E/22E EPS by 16-18% to reflect stronger revenue and fine-tuned margins. 
Our new TP of RMB46.9 is based on lowered 35x FY21E P/E (vs prior 40x), given 
recent weaker sector sentiment. We believe stock price pullback on recent mgmt. 
changes provides good buying opportunity given Goertek’s product roadmap and 
high earnings visibility of 36% FY20-22E EPS CAGR. Maintain BUY. 
 Strong 4Q20 results on AirPods momentum and improving yield. Goertek 
reported upbeat 4Q20 earnings with revenue/net profit of RMB22.9bn/838mn, 
up 108%/184% YoY. We attribute this to 1) higher share and improving yield 
for AirPods, 2) stronger AR/VR products (new Oculus), and 3) better demand 
for new products (AirPods Max, HomePod mini). For FY20, we estimate 
revenue from precision components/ hearables (AirPods/Homepod)/ smart 
products (watch, VR) grew 20%/65%/59% YoY.  
 2021 Outlook: AirPods and AR/VR as dual growth engines. We estimate 
AirPods shipment will grow 45%/22% YoY to 94mn/115mn in FY20E/21E, and 
Goertek’s share allocation will expand from 23% in FY20 to 37%/41% in 
FY21/22E, driving AirPods revenue growth of 103%/23% YoY. in addition, we 
expect Goertek VR/AR segment will regain traction with 40%/30% YoY growth 
in FY21/20E, backed by new product cycle from Oculus Quest and Sony 
PSVR in 2H20E.  
 Share repurchase program announced. Goertek announced a new share 
repurchase program of RMB500mn-1bn with price no more than RMB39.0 per 
share, equivalent to 12.82mn-25.64mn share and 0.39-0.78% of its total 
shares outstanding. We believe the share buyback signaled mgmt.’s strong 
confidence about the company’s outlook.  
 Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB46.9 We revised up our FY21-22E EPS 
by 16-18% to reflect stronger revenue and fine-tuned margins. Our FY21/22E 
EPS are 11%/7% above consensus, and our new TP of RMB46.9 is based on 
lowered 35x FY21E P/E (vs prior 40x), due to recent weaker sector sentiment. 
We believe recent correction offers good opportunity to accumulate the stock.

Valuation  
Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB46.9 (40% upside) 
We raised FY21-22E EPS by 16-18% to reflect stronger sales and revised margins. Our 
new TP of RMB46.9 is based on lowered 35x FY21E P/E (vs 40x prior). Following recent 
correction on concerns over mgmt. changes, we think the stock is attractive at 24.8x FY21E 
P/E, given 36% FY20-22E EPS CAGR, strong earnings visibility and improving ROE.
