 Solid earnings growth in 3Q20. Tigermed reported 3Q20 revenue of 
RMB848mn, up 22.3% YoY, which accelerated from 8.6% YoY revenue 
growth in 1H20. Attributable net profit was up 81.4% YoY in 3Q20 to 
RMB319mn, including RMB288mn one-off fair value gains and investment 
gains. Adjusted net profit rose 29.4% YoY in 3Q20 to RMB195mn, driven by 
both solid topline growth and margin improvement. Gross margin improved 
2.89ppts in 3Q20 vs 3Q19, mainly due to the consolidation of acquired targets, 
including MOSIM (an early-stage clinical CRO company) and Yaxincheng (a 
medical translation CRO company). 
 Strong quarterly recovery. Recall that Tigermed’s operation was interrupted 
by COVID-19 in the first half of 2020. As the pandemic got largely controlled 
in China, clinical trial operations started to normalize from 2Q20, leading to 
recovery in Tigermed’s domestic revenue. However, the COVID-19 outbreak 
worsened in overseas regions such as the US and Europe. As a result, the 
overseas CRO demand, such as data management services and Frontage's 
BIO, CMC, DMPK services, were negatively impacted. In 1H20, Tigermed 
received 42% of total revenue from overseas and 40% of gross profit from 
overseas. We expect the COVID-19 epidemic to gradually ease in 2021E 
thanks to the wide supply of vaccines, which will drive further business 
recovery for Tigermed. 
 H-share IPO brings sufficient capital for Tigermed’s global expansion. 
Tigermed has completed its dual-listing in HKEX in Aug 2020 and raised a 
total of HK$11.82bn net proceeds. With sufficient cash on hand, we expect 
Tigermed to accelerate its pace of global expansion via both acquisitions and 
self-expansion. Given China’s large patient pool, international pharmaceutical 
companies are including China as one site in MRCTs to speed up the 
enrollment of patients. Meanwhile, Chinese pharmaceutical companies are 
doing many MRCTs for the purpose of product registration in overseas 
countries. Tigermed provides clinical CRO services for Chinese innovative 
products to go global and multinational enterprises’ innovative products to 
enter Chinese market. The Company already has established good network 
in Asia Pacific regions, while US market could be the next emphasis. 
 Maintain BUY. We raised our 2020E/21E net profit forecasts by 90%/17%, 
respectively, to factor in fair value gains and investment gains, and raised 
SOTP-based TP to RMB146.43, implying 70x FY22E P/E. We like Tigermed 
given its leading positioning in clinical CRO space and large potential in 
overseas expansion.
