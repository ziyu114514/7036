LONGi realized 3Q20 net profit of RMB2,240mn; beat our expectation. The 
Company continued to deliver outstanding GPM from wafer and module at above 
30%/20% respectively, despite the fact that poly-si and PV glass price 
experienced substantial hike during the quarter. We think LONGi’s supply chain 
management and insight to the market helped sustain its leading profitability. 
Looking ahead, we expect LONGi to accelerate wafer and module sales to 2.6bn 
piece and 5.8GW respectively. We raise FY20-22E EPS forecast by 8.2%-30.0% 
to RMB2.25/3.10/4.06, respectively. Our TP is lifted to RMB90.0 based on 
29.0x FY21E PER. Maintain BUY. 
 3Q20 results beat again. 3Q external wafer/module shipment surged 23.7% 
/114.6% respectively to 1.57bn piece/5.91GW. Major expenses were 
maintained stable, while net financial turned negative as LONGi employed 
higher debt. Operating cash flow exhibited strong rebound as bills receivables 
accumulated in 1H20 were released during the quarter, and advanced 
customer payment from domestic clients were mostly paid in cash due to 
tightened module supply. 3Q20 net profit was RMB2,240mn, up 51.9% YoY 
and largely flat QoQ. In 9M20, LONGi realized net profit of RMB6,357mn, up 
82.4% YoY, accounting for 81% of our previous 2020E earnings estimates.  
 Supply chain management was a key highlight in 3Q20. Poly-si price 
experienced a sharp hike from Jul after supply disruption in Xinjiang. LONGi 
was able to manage supply shortage impacts through building low costs poly-
si inventories in 1H20, and signing long term purchasing as well as upstream 
investments contracts to secure poly-si supply. For PV glass, we think LONGi 
took similar measures as poly-si, and the Company also intends to develop 
more new suppliers with incentives such as large-scale order or direct 
investments. Mgmt. disclosed 3Q20 GPM of wafer/module were above 
30%/20% respectively, which were higher than our expectation.  
 GPM guidance to remain stable in 4Q20. LONGi had lifted wafer price for 
several times in view of poly-si price hike. Mgmt. remained confident to 
maintain wafer sales profitability with pricing adjustments as low costs 
inventories were consumed. For module end, we think LONGi will be able to 
pass through majority of poly-si and PV glass costs change to downstream PV 
farm developers. Overall, we think LONGi will be able to sustain its profitability.

 Lift FY20-22E earnings by 8.2-30%. LONGi’s supply chain performance and 
costs passthrough capability continued to exceed our expectation.  Based on 
wafer/module shipment of 26bn pieces/5.8GW in 4Q20 with slightly lifted ASP, 
we revise FY20E EPS projection by 8.2% to RMB2.25. For 2021-22E, on the 
back of accelerating capacity growth and more optimistic ASP outlook, we 
raise EPS forecast by 20.4%/30.0% respectively to RMB3.10/4.06. We roll 
over valuation to FY21E based on 29x P/E multiple. Our TP is raised by 24.3% 
to RMB90.0. Maintain BUY.  
 Risk factors: 1) short of Poly-Si and PV glass to support capacity expansion 
in 2021E; and 2) cell technology upgrade to HJT at faster-than-expected pace.
