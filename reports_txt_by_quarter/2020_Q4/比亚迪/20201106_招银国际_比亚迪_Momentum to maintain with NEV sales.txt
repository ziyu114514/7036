BYD announced that total auto sales volume achieved 48K units in Oct, an 
increase of 16.1% YoY. Among these, NEPV achieved 22K units, an increase of 
83.1% YoY/ 18.5% MoM. The Company announced its 4Q20E earnings guidance 
with a bottom-line range of RMB 4.2bn-4.6bn in 2021E. We believe BYD will 
benefit most from recent improving sentiment on NEV, from both sales volume 
and market sentiment perspective. We raised our bottom-line forecast by 24% to 
RMB 5.2bn in 2020E to reflect a higher ASP and GPM on auto segment. 
Reiterate BUY rating and raise TP to RMB223.8. 
 BYD continues rapid growth in NEV segment in Oct. BYD sold 47K units 
(ICE+NEV) of auto in Oct, an increase of 16.1%YoY. Its NEV business 
remains on the high growth path with a total sales volume of 23K units, an 
increase of 84.7% YoY. Among these, NEPV achieved 22K units (+83.1% 
YoY) whereas NECV achieved 1.2K units (+123.2% YoY). We believe that the 
total delivery of model Han is in line with our expectations, with a total volume 
of 7,545 units in Oct. We expect that the sales volume of Han will continue to 
rise MoM within the year as the production of the blade battery is ramping up. 
In terms of ICE, sales reached 25K units in Oct, down 14.2% YoY/up 9.9% 
MoM. 
 3Q20 achieved RMB1.75bn, an increase 1363% YoY, in line with the 
Company’s earnings preview. Among them, BYD Electronics (285 HK, BUY) 
contributed approximately RMB1.22mn while other segments contributed 
RMB527mn. We believe that a series of new models, underpinned by 
production ramp-up of blade battery, will support the sales performance in the 
short term. We expect BYD will achieve total NEPV sales of 45K units in Nov 
& Dec, an increase of 112%YoY. We expect DM4.0 (expected rollout in 
1Q21E) and new BEV platform (expected rollout in 2021 Shanghai Auto Show) 
will further boost its NEV sales in 2021E.  
 Higher ASP and GPM raise the 2021E bottom-line forecast. We expect 
that strong sales of model Han among its NEPV will increase to 20% in NEV 
sales mixbased on our new calculation. Therefore, aggregate ASP for the 
NEPV segment increased by 9% to RMB187Kin 2020. In the meanwhile, we 
believe that BYD will continue to utilize its cost control advantage, driving its 
improvement in GPM of auto segment. We therefore raised our 2021E 
earnings forecast by 30% to RMB6.88mn.

 Sentiment-driven re-rating on the NEV segment.  BYD’s share price 
performed well exceed our expectation, while fundamentals were largely on 
track with our projection. We think BYD’s re-rating was mainly sentimentally 
driven on an optimistic outlook for the NEV segment. Based on our SOTP 
framework, we believe the market is currently pricing the NEV segment at a 
5.5x FY21E P/S ratio. After peers’ recent share price rally, we believe BYD’s 
NEV valuation is significantly lower than the peer's average of 10.1x FY21E 
P/S. Based on FY21E NEV sales projection of RMB62.8bn, we expect 1) bull 
case share price to trade up 8.9x P/S at RMB263, in line with Tesla (TSLA 
US, NR)’s valuation in a thrilling market sentiment; 2) bear case share price 
to trade down to 3x P/S at RMB145.7; and 3) base case valuation of 7x 
P/S at RMB223.8, matching with peers valuation growth with 30% discount. 
Our valuation revision reflects changes only on the NEV segment, and we 
think other catalysts such as power batteries gaining external shipment could 
boost valuation further. Our TP for BYD is revised up by 43.7% to 
RMB223.8, maintain BUY.
