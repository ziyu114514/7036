Weichai’s 3Q20 net profit came at RMB2.4bn, up 37% YoY. The results are 
encouraging as (1) revenue surged 48% YoY which is above expectation, (2) 
gross margin rebounded 1.7ppt QoQ which should ease market concerns. We 
see several positive drivers going forward: (1) Management is confident of 
achieving sequential gross margin improvement in 4Q20E; (2) Latest guidance 
of KION (KGX GR) offers improved visibility; (3) New business growth is on good 
track. We raised our earnings forecast in 2020E-22E by 2-5%, due mainly to 
higher sales volume assumptions. Our SOTP is lifted from RMB16.8 to RMB17.9, 
after rolling over the base year to 2021E. Maintain BUY.     
 Key highlights on 3Q20 financials. Weichai’s revenue surged 48% YoY to 
RMB52.9bn. Based on our calculation, Weichai’s revenue from core business 
(ex-KION) surged 90% YoY to ~RMB36bn, while KION’s revenue slightly 
dropped 4% YoY to EUR2.07bn. Blended gross margin in 3Q was 19.3%, 
down 3.5ppt YoY but up 1.7ppt QoQ. Weichai maintained good expense 
control with SG&A ratio continued to reduce YoY. Net profit grew 37% YoY to 
RMB2.4bn. It’s worth noting that KION reported adjusted EBIT/net profit of 
EUR159mn / EUR82mn in 3Q20, representing a significant recovery from a 
net loss of EUR17mn in 2Q20.  
 Engine sales volume +90% YoY in 3Q20. In 3Q20, total engine sales volume 
grew 90% YoY to 260k units. Among this, HDT engine surged 100% YoY to 
120k units, with market share increasing 2.5ppt YoY and 4ppt QoQ. LDT 
engine surged 2x YoY.  
 New business on good track. In 9M20, large-bore engine, mainly installed 
for data centers, grew 30% YoY to 2.5k units. Revenue from hydraulic 
component grew 40% YoY in 9M20.  
 Positive management guidance: (1) Volume of gas engine model with less 
usage of precious metals will further increase in 4Q20E, which will drive gross 
margin sequentially; (2) Sales volume of engine to Sinotruk (3808 HK, BUY) 
is expected to accelerate; (3) Amid the latest city lockdown in Europe, KION 
is still expected to deliver EUR101-181mn of adjusted EBIT in 4Q20E. In 
particular, KION’s supply chain solutions will continue to benefit from e-
commerce project growth.

Key takeaways from post-results conference call 
Sales volume of engines 
 Total engine sales volume surged 90% YoY to 260k units in 3Q20. In 9M20, total 
engine sales grew 35% YoY to 720k units.  
 HDT engine surged 100% YoY to 120k units in 3Q20. According to management, 
market share in 3Q20 gained 2.5ppt YoY and 4ppt QoQ. In 9M20, HDT engine 
sales grew 30% YoY to 360k units, accounting 50% of the total engine sales.  
 LDT engine surged 200% YoY to 85k units in 3Q20. In 9M20, the sales volume 
grew >100% YoY.  
 Large-bore engine grew 30% YoY to 2.5k units in 9M20. Revenue reported similar 
growth in the period. Order intake in Oct reached 200 units. Management expects 
the full year growth to be similar to that in 9M20.  
Gross margin 
 Weichai’s blended gross margin in 3Q20 improved 1.7ppt QoQ to 19.3%. 
According to management, gas engines with less usage of precious metals 
launched in mid-Jun has helped improve the gross margin in 3Q20.   
 In 4Q20E, Weichai will launch more gas engines with lower level of precious metals. 
Gross margin is expected to further improve from 3Q20 and return to a level similar 
to 1Q20 (around 22.4%).   
 In the longer term, Weichai is expanding the sales volume of engine in the field of 
industrial power (including large-bore engine), agricultural machinery and LDT. 
Therefore, the gross margin will be subject to the product mix going forward. In 
particular, LDT carries relatively lower margin at present. That said, management 
expects a higher industry concentration in the LDT sector. Such potential 
improvement of competitive landscape could help Weichai to raise price in future.   
KION  
 KION’s latest guidance has already taken in consideration the latest impact of 
COVID-19 related city lockdown in Europe.  
 This new wave of pandemic has less impact on Germany, compared with France 
and Italy. Besides, KION has experience in managing the crisis and therefore the 
operation is expected to less affected in 4Q20E, compared with 2Q20.  
HDT industry outlook 
 Weichai expects the HDT demand in China to reach 1.5mn units this year. In 
2021E, Weichai expects at least 1.2mn units of demand. Weichai is confident of 
gaining market share in future.  
Weichai’s engine sales guidance  
 Weichai expects the production volume of engine in 4Q20E to increase slightly 
compared with that in 3Q20. Inventory level is currently less than half month.  
 Engine installation to Sinotruk increased in 3Q20, with volume reaching the total 
sales to Sinotruk in 1H20. The high installation was driven by market demand. 
Weichai expects the installation ratio to remain high for the full year.

The implementation of NES VI  
 National Emission Standard (NES) VI will be effective on 1 Jul 2021. Weichai has 
already well-prepared for that in terms of product development.  
 In particular, Weichai has successfully achieved >50% thermal efficiency for the 
commercial diesel engine. This will become a key competitor advantage over the 
competitors in future.  
 Weichai will reduce the production volume of NES V engines in 1H21E in order to 
minimize the inventory risk after Jul 2021.  
Commercial diesel engine with >50% thermal efficiency  
 Low fuel consumption (8% lower) and high reliability are the two major advantages 
of this new engine.  
 Target models are 10L and 13L. Weichai expects the products will be launched in 
late 2020E or early 2021E.  
 The ASP will be higher than the existing products.  
Linde Hydraulics (China) 
 Revenue from Linde Hydraulics (China) reached RMB350mn in 9M20, up 40% 
YoY. In 3Q20, revenue surged 100% YoY. 
 Currently, XCMG (000425 CH) and Shantui (山重建机) are the major customers. 
Linde is also increasing the sales to Zoomlion (1157 HK, 000157 CH, BUY), 
Lonking (3339 HK, SELL) and Liugong (000528 CH, NR).     
 Low oil consumption and good shock absorption are the two major advantages of 
Linde’s hydraulic products.  
 Linde has been increasing the in-house production of components, which will help 
reduce cost in future.  
 Linde is focusing on excavator at present. It is expected that Linde’s hydraulic parts 
and engines will be installed for several thousand of excavators this year.  
 Management expects strong growth in terms of volume and profit margin in 2021E.  
Fuel cell battery  
 The latest policy released by MIIT is positive to the fuel cell battery industry 
development. Weichai expects rapid growth over the coming 3-5 years.  
 Weichai has already sold fuel cell products for 200-300 units of commercial 
vehicles.  
 Going forward, Weichai will launch fuel cell battery products for trucks. Trial 
operation is planned.
