In the first three quarters, SAIC achieved total revenue of RMB498.7bn, down 
14.8% YoY while NP was RMB16.7bn, down 19.9% YoY. In 3Q20, revenue was 
RMB214.9bn, an increase of 2.8% YoY while NP was RMB8.3bn, an increase of 
17.4% YoY. We raise our TP to RMB33.9 (based on 13.5x 2021E P/E) with an 
upside of 23.3%, from TP RMB21.1 based on 11.5x 2020E P/E. Upgrade to BUY. 
 In 3Q20, GPM was 11.0%, down 2.4ppt YoY, reflecting intensified market 
competition. The expense ratio was 9.6%, down 2.3ppt YoY (tax exp -0.1ppt, 
S&D exp -2.0ppt, Admin exp -0.3ppt). The decrease in S&D exp ratio was 
mainly due to 1) implementation of the new accounting standard in the current 
period which moves the car loan interest subsidy from S&D expense to 
revenue recognition offset; and 2) the YoY decrease of logistic expense and 
advertising expense. 
 SAIC achieved a total investment income of RMB8.9bn in 3Q20, an 
increase of 19% YoY. Among which, investment income from JVs and 
associates was RMB6.6bn, an increase of 2.9% YoY. SAIC Volkswagen 
achieved sales of 454K units in 3Q20, down 4% YoY. SAIC GM achieved 
sales of 395K units, an increase of 3% YoY. We believe the main factor which 
contributes to YoY earning growth in 3Q20 was still the investment income 
from financial assets. 
 The sales performance of major JVs is still mixed. SAIC Volkswagen 
launched a mid-term facelift version Santana in Oct (-23% YoY in 3Q20). At 
the end of Oct, the first BEV based on the MEB platform, namely ID.4 was put 
into production. We expect both new models to drive the recovery of the 
Volkswagen brand. However, the Skoda brand fell 29% YoY in 3Q20, which 
is still expected to drag down the recovery of SAIC Volkswagen in the short-
term. For SAIC-GM, the sales volume of Excelle (英朗) in Sep exceeded 30K 
units after the re-launch of four-cylinder version. As a result, Buick achieved a 
30% YoY growth in 3Q20. The sales of high-end brand Cadillac increased by 
75% YoY given the strong performance in overall luxury segment. However, 
due to lack of brand power, Chevrolet declined by 47% YoY, dragged down 
the overall performance of SAIC GM.

SAIC Motor (600104 CH) 
Market sentiment is rising on A-share auto

 
The realization of certain catalysts gradually boosts market sentiment. 
SAIC Volkswagen officially released its first model ID.4 based on the MEB 
platform, marking a milestone on Volkswagen’s NEV roadmap in China 
market. We expect the market will re-evaluate SAIC’s NEV presence after 
the rollout of the "Development Plan for New Energy Vehicle Industry 
(2021~2035). In addition, we expect SAIC Audi project will have news 
coming out in 2021E. Forming the two-pillar (Audi + Cadillac) among the 
high-end brand will further enhance market sentiment on SAIC. 
 
We raise our bottom-line forecast to RMB24.1bn in 2020E to reflect the 
strong 3Q20 results. Our revised NP forecast suggests that SAIC’s bottom-
line will grow 55% YoY in 4Q20E. At the same time, we revised up our NP 
forecast to RMB29.3bn in 2021E to reflect its great cost control. We raise 
our TP to RMB33.9 (based on 13.5x 2021E P/E) with an upside of 23.3% 
from initial TP RMB21.1 (based on initial 11.5x 2020E P/E). Upgrade to 
BUY.
