 Strong growth acceleration in 3Q20. WuXi AppTec reported third-quarter 
revenue of RMB4.58bn, up 35.4% YoY, Non-IFRS net profit was up 44.3% YoY 
to RMB958mn. Attributable net profit decreased 8.1% YoY to RMB651mn, mainly 
due to foreign exchange loss. Third-quarter has achieved significant growth 
compared to the first half of 2020, where China-based laboratory services, CDMO 
services, US - based laboratory services and Clinical research & other CRO 
services realized 38.9%/ 54.9%/ -13.5%/ 16.8% YoY change in revenue.  
 CDMO and China-based lab service continue to be major growth driver. 
CDMO service and China-base lab service recorded a YoY growth of 54.9%/ 
38.9% in 3Q20 and 36.5%/ 30.9% in 9M20. Such strong performance offset 
the challenges faced by the US-based laboratory services due to the COVID-
19 pandemic. Thanks to follow-the-molecule strategy, the Company added 
440 new molecules into its CDMO pipeline YTD and total CDMO pipeline has 
grown to more than 1,100 active projects, including 26 commercialized 
projects, 42 Phase III projects. During the same period, WuXi AppTec has 
submitted IND filings for 18 new chemical entities (NCE) for its customers and 
obtained 20 CTAs in China. Cumulatively, WuXi AppTec has submitted 103 
NCE IND filings with the NMPA and obtained 77 CTAs including 1 project in 
Phase III clinical trial, 9 projects in Phase II clinical trials, and 56 projects in 
Phase I clinical trials. 
 Globalization strategy to enable innovation worldwide. YTD, WuXi 
AppTec added over 900 new customers and provided services to a wide range 
of over 4,100 active customers, including all the top 20 big pharma companies 
worldwide. In 9M20, overseas customers contributed 76.4% of total revenue, 
while China customers accounted for 23.6% of revenue, representing a YoY 
growth of 25.3% and 34.4%, respectively. Driven by the “long-tail” strategy, 
“Long-tail” & China customers 67.2% of total revenue, up 28.4% YoY in 9M20.  
 We lifted SOTP-based TP from RMB131.98 to RMB139.05 to reflect 
strong long-term growth outlook for WuXi AppTec. We forecast WuXi 
AppTec’s adjusted Non-IFRS attributable net profit to grow by 35%/33%/32% 
YoY in FY20E/21E/22E respectively, and attributable net profit to increase 
85%/22%/32% YoY in FY20E/21E/22E. Moreover, WuXi AppTec maintained 
a diversified investment portfolio which will bring significant investment gains 
over the long term.
