After a sharp decline in 2Q20, PAB’s earnings regained positive growth of 
+6.1% YoY in 3Q20. As such, YTD profit contraction narrowed to -5.2% in 9M20 
YoY from -11.2% YoY in 1H20. Key results highlights are fast pick-up in retail 
loans, improving asset quality, and robust fee income. We stay upbeat on PAB’s 
4Q20 outlook, given: 1) strong macro trend, thus waning policy intervention on 
banks’ earnings; 2) continued recovery in consumption and retail credit; 3) 
interbank rates will likely retreat on loose liquidity, easing NIM pressure; and 4) 
above-peers provision coverage offers room to lower credit cost.  
 Results positives: 1) Loan growth was solid at 3.1% QoQ, mainly driven 
by retail loans (+5.7% QoQ). In particular, new mortgage (+7.5% QoQ) and 
auto loans (+10.4% QoQ) remained strong, and credit card resumed 
expansion (+3.0% QoQ) from 1H20 contraction. Proportion of retail loans 
increased to 58% of total loans as of 3Q20. 2) Asset quality improved 
notably. PAB accelerated NPL disposal in 3Q20. As a result, NPL ratio 
dropped 33bp QoQ to 1.32%, and provision coverage further climbed to 
3.4ppt QoQ to 218%. NPLs still covered 104% of >60day overdue loans, 
indicating stringent loss recognition. 3) Net fee income was up 32.6% YoY, 
likely on strong bank card and agency services fees. 4) Cost-income ratio 
fell 1.4ppt YoY to 29% in 3Q20, suggesting better operating efficiency; 5) 
Stable expansion in retail client base. Number of retail/ wealth/ private 
banking client rose 1.9%/4.5%/8.2% QoQ. Retail AUM increased 7.2% QoQ 
to RMB2.49tn. 
 Results negatives: 1) NIM declined 11bp QoQ to 2.48%. Loan yield slid 
32bp QoQ, likely on write-off in retail loans past due and the Bank’s more 
prudent lending appetite. Lower deposit cost was partly offset by rising 
interbank funding cost, as market rates rebounded in 3Q20. 2) Trading and 
investment gain was down 72% YoY, likely due to bond yield hike in 3Q20. 
3) Deposits rose 2.5% QoQ, slower than loan growth. LDR increased to 
100.5%. 4) Capital position weakened, with 5bp/10bp QoQ decline in 
Tier1/total CAR.   
 Maintain BUY and RMB22.8 TP. We keep earnings forecast unchanged, 
and our TP of RMB22.8 is derived from 1.5x target P/B and FY20E BVPS of 
RMB15.2.
