Reiterate BUY. The acceleration of excavator sales growth in Sep reaffirms our 
positive view on the industry upcycle. Besides, we remain confident on SANY’s 
market share gain story, on the back of strong R&D and management execution. 
We raised our 2020E-22E earnings forecast for SANY by 5-6%, after 
incorporating higher sales volume assumptions. We raised our TP from RMB26.4 
to RMB34.6, after rolling over our target P/E multiple (17x) to 2021E P/E, on the 
back of 17% estimated earnings growth in 2021E.  
 Industry sales growth of excavator accelerated in Sep. According to the 
latest figure from CCMA, excavator sales volume by major players in China 
surged 65% YoY to 26k units in Sep, the highest growth rate since May. Large 
/ mid-size excavator sales growth reached 53%/106% YoY in Sep, which 
suggested strong demand from infrastructure and property construction 
projects. In 9M20, excavator sales growth reached 32% YoY.   
 Raise industry sales projection. Based on Jiangsu Hengli’s (601100 CH, 
BUY) latest production plan of hydraulic cylinders (see our latest note on 
Hengli [link]), we foresee strong excavator demand growth with high visibility 
in 4Q20E. We raise our industry excavator sales volume assumption in 
2020E/21E by 13%/10%. We expect 35%/3% YoY growth in 2020E/21E, with 
key drivers coming from resilient construction activities, replacement of labour 
and stringent environmental policies.     
 SANY continues to outpace industry growth. SANY’s excavator sales 
volume in Sep surged 85% YoY, outpacing the industry growth of 65%. 
SANY’s market share reached 28.5%/26.3% in Sep / 9M20. SANY is one of 
the very few players that consistently delivers market share gain. We believe 
import substitution and export market are two structural drivers for SANY 
going forward.  
 3Q20E results preview: We forecast SANY to deliver 60% YoY net profit 
growth in 3Q20E, driven by 44% YoY increase in revenue and operating 
leverage. SANY is scheduled to report on 29 Oct.      
 Key risks: (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic; (2) Slowdown of 
construction activities; (3) Risk of expanding to financing business.
