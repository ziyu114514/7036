SANY Heavy’s net profit in 3Q20 grew 57% YoY to RMB3.86bn, in line with our 
expectation. We feel comfortable with our full year estimate and we are staying 
positive on SANY Heavy due to the high visibility of machinery demand, 
continuous market share gain and on-track cost reduction driven by automation 
of production. We left our earnings forecast unchanged. Reiterate BUY with TP 
of RMB34.6 (based on 17x 2021E P/E).  
 Key highlights on 3Q20 results. Revenue grew 55% YoY to RMB23.9bn in 
3Q20. Gross margin narrowed by 2.8ppt YoY to 30.4% but was more than 
offset by good expense control and operating leverage. Selling and 
distribution expense ratio reduced 1.7ppt YoY to 5.1%. SANY boosted the 
R&D spending by 51% YoY to RMB1.28bn in 3Q and we believe the 
continuous spending growth will continue to help SANY widen its advantage 
over its competitors. Net profit margin slightly expanded 0.3ppt to 16.6%. In 
9M20, net profit grew 35% YoY to RMB12.4bn, accounting for 83% of our full 
year estimates (run rate in 9M19: 82%). Operating cash inflow increased by 
33% YoY to RMB11bn, largely in line with the net profit growth.    
 Auto financing business consolidated in 3Q20 results. In Dec 2019, 
SANY announced to acquire 91.4% interest in SANY Capital (the auto 
financing business) for a consideration of RMB3.38bn. The transaction was 
completed earlier and the auto financing business started consolidated in 
SANY’s financial statement in 3Q20. In 3Q20, the net interest income grew 
20% YoY to RMB104mn. We calculate that the net interest margin in 3Q20 
was 8.9% (annualized). That said, we do not expect the auto financing 
business to be a profit driver as it serves the purpose of driving the machinery 
sales.  
 Key risks: (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic; (2) Slowdown of 
construction activities; (3) Risk of expanding to financing business.
