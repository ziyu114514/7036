We see potential earnings upside in 2020E-22E driven by several drivers: (1) 
Short term: Hengli’s production plan in Dec implies 20% MoM increase in 
hydraulic cylinders output volume, which is surprisingly strong; (2) Medium term: 
Solid market share gain on the back of the rising market share of Chinese-brand 
excavator manufactures (Hengli’s customers); (3) Long-term: Trend of import 
substitution of pump & valves and other products is clear. We revise up our 
earnings forecast in 2020E-22E by 8-10% (9-10% above consensus), after 
revising up both sales volume and gross margin assumptions. We continue to 
like Hengli’s solid position in the high-end hydraulic components industry with 
clear roadmap to achieve import substitution. Our TP is lifted to RMB114.4 from 
RMB87, based on 55x 2021E P/E (30% premium to the historical average of 42x).  
 Resilient demand for excavator in 2021E. For the industry as a whole, major 
manufacturers of excavator delivered sales volume of 296k units in 11M20, 
up 37% YoY, according to CCMA. We expect the full year sales volume growth 
will reach ~40%. In 2021E, we see upside to our existing excavator demand 
growth forecast of 3%, driven by infrastructure spending growth and the 
continuous trend of the substitution of labour by excavators.  
 Hengli’s growth is driven by structural factors. We estimate a single-digit 
growth of excavator demand will be enough for Hengli to deliver 20% revenue 
growth in 2021E, given that the Chinese excavator makers (majority of them 
are Hengli’s customers with high installation ratios), such as SANY Heavy 
(600031 CH, BUY), are gaining market share, which will drive Hengli’s share 
gain. We forecast Hengli’s market share in hydraulic cylinder to increase from 
52% in 2020E to 61% in 2022E. Besides, we expect pump & valve for large-
size excavators, as well as non-standardized hydraulic components for 
various industries will serve as other key drivers.  
 Latest production plan suggests robust demand in 1Q21E. According to 
Hengli’s production plan in Dec, the scheduled production volume of hydraulic 
cylinder (for excavator) is expected to reach 79k units, up 20% MoM. We 
estimate this will translate into ~40k units for excavator demand for the 
industry in Jan 2021E, which is impressive given that the industry sales 
volume was only 9.9k units in Jan 2020. On the other hand, we expect Hengli’s 
hydraulic pump and valves will see strong growth in Dec on MoM basis.  
 Key risks: (1) Slowdown of construction activities; (2) risk of overseas 
expansion; (3) increase in raw materials cost.

Valuation 
We raise our TP to RMB114.4 from RMB87, based on 55x 2021E P/E (30% premium to 
the historical average of 42x). We believe the valuation premium is justified due to 
improving earnings visibility for a couple of reasons: (1) the policy of domestic circulation 
and competitive landscape are favourable for Hengli to achieve further import substitution 
across different products; and (2) Hengli’s growth has become more structural rather than 
cyclical.
