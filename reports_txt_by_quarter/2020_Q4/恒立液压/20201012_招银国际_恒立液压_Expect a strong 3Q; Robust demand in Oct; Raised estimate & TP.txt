Reiterate BUY. We expect Hengli’s share price momentum to continue driven by 
several near-term catalysts: (1) We forecast Hengli to report an impressive net 
profit growth of 95% YoY in 3Q20E; (2) Hengli’s production plan in Oct suggests 
robust demand to continue across major products; (3) improvement in 
construction activities will continue to offer strong support to the demand for 
excavators and other machinery going forward. We revised up our earnings 
forecast in 2020E-22E by 3-6% (9-10% above consensus). Our TP is lifted to 
RMB87 from RMB82, based on unchanged multiple of 45x 2021E P/E (historical 
average).  
 3Q20E results preview. We estimate that Hengli’s hydraulic cylinder volume 
reached 170k units (for excavators) and 34k units (for non-standardized 
products) in 3Q20E. Fast growing products such as valves and motors saw 
sequential monthly sales increase in 3Q. We forecast Hengli to deliver 
revenue growth of 50% YoY with gross margin expansion YoY, thanks to 
higher utilization rate. We estimate net profit to grow 95% YoY to RMB481mn 
in 3Q. Hengli is scheduled to report the results on 27 Oct.   
 Production volume to stay high in Oct. Based on our understanding, 
excavator cylinder monthly production volume reached 63k units in Sep, 
suggesting sequential growth. According to the production plan in Oct, 
excavator cylinder volume is expected to stay at similar level. Besides, the 
production plan for pump and valves implies sequential growth in Oct. We 
expect robust demand throughout 4Q, on the back of strong construction 
activities.   
 Key risks: (1) Slowdown of construction activities; (2) risk of overseas 
expansion; (3) increase in raw materials cost.
