Shennan Circuit (002916 CH) 
 
 
 
FY23 results beat helped by better 4Q  
 
Shennan Circuit released its FY23 earnings, with revenue down 3.3% YoY to 
RMB13.5bn (5%/2% higher than our forecast/consensus) and net profit down 
14.8% YoY to RMB1.4bn (11%/5% higher than our forecast/consensus). The 
Company beat estimates thanks to a stronger-than-expected 4Q. The 
quarterly revenue/NP accounted for 30%/35% of full year results. 4Q revenue 
increased by 15.9% YoY/18.6% QoQ to RMB4.1bn, and net profit increased by 
6.6% YoY/12.8% QoQ to RMB490mn. GPM rose in three consecutive quarters to 
24.2% in 4Q (vs. 22.8%/23.4% in 2Q/3Q).  
We expect Shennan to have a modest recovery this year, as we believe the 
PCB sector has reached the end of the trough in 2H23. 2024 revenue growth 
is projected to be 12.5% from a low base in 2023, given utilization rates of both 
PCB and substrate businesses are up. However, we do not expect a full 
recovery for Shennan, at least not in 1H24, considering ongoing price 
erosion in PCB products and weak demand in telecom market. Meanwhile, 
we are conservative in NP growth (10% in 2024), due to a potential increase in 
copper price. Maintain HOLD with TP adjusted to RMB79, based on 27x 
2024E P/E, higher than previous 25x given the current position of the cycle, but 
lower than 5-year historical of 32x as challenges remain. The stock is currently 
trading at 28.5x 24E P/E, which is fair. 
 By segments, in FY23, PCB/substrate revenue both declined by 8.5% YoY to 
RMB8.1bn/RMB2.3bn, while PCBA sales rose 21.5% to RMB2.1bn. 2H23 
results were much stronger, with 8.0%/49.2%/80.8% increase from 1H. 
Substrate sales grew as downstream inventory digestion has almost ended 
and utilization rate was back to 80% in 2H. PCB growth was mainly driven by 
auto/energy 
market, 
partially 
offset 
by 
ongoing 
weakness 
in 
telecom/datacenter. AI demand brought incremental revenue, however, the 
contribution was not large. GPM for PCB and substrate businesses were 
26.6% and 23.9%, declined by 1.57ppts and 3.11ppts, respectively. 2H23 
GPM was improved from 1H for both segments (1.36ppts and 7.87ppts). 
 Despite industry headwinds, we think Shennan is poised for future growth as 
the Company achieved a significant milestone in its FC-BGA production lines. 
Wuxi phase II and Guangzhou factories are ramping up capacity, which will 
benefit Shennan in the long run. However, in the short term, these two 
projects are likely to weigh on margins (R&D exp. up 31% in FY23).  
 A potential increase in copper price. We saw copper concentrates TC index 
reached historical low at US$11/tonne in March. In addition, Fed may cut 
rates in June 2024. These catalysts may favor a jump in copper price in the 
near term, which will hurt PCB suppliers’ GPM.
