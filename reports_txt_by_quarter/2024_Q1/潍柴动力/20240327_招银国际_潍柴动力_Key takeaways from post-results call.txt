CMB International Global Markets | Equity Research | Company Update 
Weichai Power (000338 CH) 
 
 
 
Key takeaways from post-results call  
 
During the post-results call yesterday, Weichai expected the industry HDT 
demand in 2024E will be ~900k units (-2% YoY). Of this, China demand is 
expected to fall by 10% YoY to 600k units while exports are expected to grow 
20% YoY to 300k units. Weichai expects the LNG price to stay low due to 
oversupply, which may help boost the demand for gas HDT. Meanwhile, high-
speed large-bore engine will serve as an important growth driver for Weichai. 
We maintain Weichai as our sector top pick. Reiterate BUY with SOTP-based 
TP of HK$22/RMB20.4 for Weichai H/A. 
Key takeaways: 
 Industry HDT demand. Weichai expects China demand in 2024E will drop 
~10% YoY to 600k units, while exports will remain strong (+20% YoY to 
300k units). In the long-run, the industry HDT demand (China + exports) is 
expected to be 800-900k units per year. Weichai believes it will be less likely 
for the demand to reach the peak level in previous years as construction 
truck demand will continue to be affected by weak property investment.  
 Natural gas HDT. Weichai believes LNG price will stay low as overall gas 
demand is weak while supply growth is underway. Therefore, Weichai 
expects gas HDTs will continue to see increasing penetration going forward 
(CMBI note: Weichai had 65% market share in HDT gas engine segment in 
2023, +6ppt YoY).  
 Fleet size of medium- to heavy-duty trucks. At present, the combined 
fleet size of HDTs and MDTs reached ~9.6mn units. Of this, NES III or below 
accounts for 900k units. Weichai expects the phase-out of NES III trucks 
through government subsidies will boost replacement demand.   
 HDT industry consolidation. Weichai believes there will be only four major 
HDT manufacturers in China after consolidation in the long-run. Sales 
volume of HDTs could be ~150-200k units for each of them.   
 High-speed 
large-bore 
engine. 
Weichai 
has 
already 
achieved 
breakthrough in this market and is competing with Caterpillar (CAT US, NR) 
Cummins (CMI US, NR), MTU and Liebherr across the globe. The global 
industry size of large-bore engines (500kW or above) in 2023 was ~80k 
units (10% growth per year in the past). Weichai delivered 8k units in 2023 
(+38% YoY), with a market share of ~10%. Driven by the strong demand 
from data centre construction, the size of large-bore engines has been 
increased to 2MW, and will further move up to 3-4MW, according to 
Weichai. Weichai also expects strong demand from the after sales market. 
The total industry size of large-bore engines is expected to reach US$20bn 
globally.
