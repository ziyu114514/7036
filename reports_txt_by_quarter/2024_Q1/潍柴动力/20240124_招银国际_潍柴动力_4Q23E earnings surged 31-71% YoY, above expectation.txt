Weichai Power (000338 CH) 
 
 
 
4Q23E earnings surged 31-71% YoY, above 
expectation  
 
Weichai Power (Weichai) pre-announced last night (23 Jan) that net profit in 
2023E is expected to surge 75-90% YoY to RMB8.58-9.32bn, which is better 
than expectations as both our and consensus estimates are only close to the 
low end of the profit range. The profit alert implies that Weichai delivered net 
profit of RMB2.08-2.82bn in 4Q23E (up 31-77% YoY), with a midpoint of 
RMB2.45bn (+54% YoY). As we highlighted in our note on 15 Jan (link), 
Weichai’s multi-cylinder diesel engine sales volume surged 51% YoY in 4Q23 
(surpassing the industry average of 26%), driven by strong HDT engine 
demand. We maintain our bullish view on Weichai (sector top pick) as a 
replacement cycle will offer certainty on HDT industry sales growth in 2024E. 
Maintain BUY with unchanged SOTP-based TP of HK19.4 (H) / RMB17.8 (A).   
 LNG/Diesel price spread expanded again. The price ratio reached a 
recent peak of 0.9 in late Dec 2023, which made LNG truck less attractive 
to buyers. That said, with the latest LNG price declining 29% since late Dec, 
the price ratio dropped to 0.69 at present. We believe the current price 
difference will boost the sales of LNG trucks again given the lower operating 
costs to truck owners. We see this as a near-term driver for Weichai given 
its 60% market share in the HDT gas engine segment.   
 Key catalysts: 1) Further expansion of LNG/Diesel price spread; 2) strong-
than-expected HDT sales figures in 1Q24E.  
 Risk factors: 1) weakness in engine export; 2) increase in component 
costs; and 3) weaker-than-expected new business growth.
