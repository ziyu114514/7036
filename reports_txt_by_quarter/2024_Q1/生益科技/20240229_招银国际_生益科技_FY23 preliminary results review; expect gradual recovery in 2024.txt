Shengyi Tech (600183 CH) 
 
 
 
FY23 preliminary results review; expect gradual 
recovery in 2024  
 
Shengyi Tech unveiled its FY23 earnings preview after Tuesday's market close. 
Full-year revenue was RMB16.6bn (-7.9% YoY) and net profit was RMB1.16bn (-
24.0% YoY), which were 3%/13% and 3%/9% lower than our/consensus estimates, 
respectively. For 4Q23, revenue decreased 2.3% YoY and 5.1% QoQ to RMB4.2bn. 
Quarterly net profit dropped more sharply by 20.8% YoY and 23.1% QoQ to 
RMB264.6mn. The miss was mainly due to larger-than-expected declines in ASP in 
both CCL and PCB segments on weaker demand and intensified competition, which 
eroded GPM, although partially offset by growing shipments of CCL products. 
Looking forward, we think the business will gradually recover in 2H24 after 
bottoming in 1H. New CCL product, which has been certified by Nvidia and is 
expected to begin the next testing phase soon, should also contribute additional 
revenue in 2024. Maintain BUY with TP adjusted to RMB19.69. 
 By segment, the company’s PCB subsidiary Shengyi Electronics (688183 CH) 
posted 2023 revenue of RMB3.3bn, down 7.4% YoY, due to heightened market 
competition and falling telecom demand. Its revenue managed to grow 2.7% 
YoY and 9.1% QoQ in 4Q23, as the company reduced its prices to maintain its 
market share. However, GPM was significantly eroded. Meanwhile, Shengyi 
Electronics is ramping up its production at one of its facilities (Dong Cheng IV), 
which also put pressure on margin. For 2024, we expect PCB segment revenue 
to grow ~10% YoY considering 2023 had a low base, and expect a moderate 
recovery in 2H24. 
 For the CCL segment, excluding Shengyi Electronics’s PCB sales, revenue 
from CCL and other business was ~RMB13.3bn, down 8.0% YoY. Revenue 
decreased moderately in 4Q23 on weaker demand, which was partially offset 
by reduction in raw materials costs. We forecast CCL segment revenue to grow 
~21% YoY, with additional contribution from AI demand. Shengyi Tech’s latest 
ultralow (UL) loss CCL product has been certified by Nvidia and is expected to 
begin the next testing phase soon. 
 We cut our 2024E revenue forecast by 4% and lower GPM by 0.7ppt to 22.1%, 
considering weaker-than-expected market demand and intensified competition. 
We expect the business will gradually recover in 2H24 with additional revenue 
contribution from new customers. Maintain BUY with adjusted TP of 
RMB19.69, based on the same 22.5x 2024E P/E multiple, less than 10% 
lower than the stock’s 5-year historical forward P/E of 24.1x. Potential 
downside risks include: 1) worse-than-expected macro environment recovery, 
2) continuous ASP pressure, and 3) increasing upstream material costs.
