WuXi AppTec (603259 CH) 
 
 
 
Best effort to ensure business continuity  
 
WuXi AppTec reported revenue of RMB40.3bn in 2023, up 2.5% YoY, 
attributable recurring net income of RMB9.7bn, up 16.8% YoY, and attributable 
adjusted non-IFRS net income of RMB10.9bn, up 15.5% YoY. Revenue was in-
line with Bloomberg consensus while attributable adjusted non-IFRS net income 
beat the consensus by 6.3%. Excluding revenue from the COVID-19 commercial 
project, the Company delivered impressive revenue growth of 25.6% YoY in 
2023, despite the challenging environment in global CXO industry. For 2024E, 
management expected the reported revenue of WuXi AppTec to fall in the range 
of RMB38.3-40.5bn, representing a decline of 5.1% YoY to growth of 0.4% YoY. 
Excluding revenues from commercial projects related to COVID-19, the revenue 
is expected to rise by 2.7% to 8.6% YoY. Furthermore, management anticipates 
the adjusted non-IFRS net income margin will remain approximately on par with 
the 2023 level, thanks to the company's ongoing efforts to enhance operational 
efficiency, new capacity coming online, and the impact of FX fluctuations.  
 Solid business development in 2023. With a solid phase synthesizer 
capacity of 32k L for peptide production, TIDES revenue remarkably grew 
by 64.4% YoY in 2023, on top of 337% YoY growth in 2022. Notably, 
backlog of TIDES as of Dec 2023 dramatically increased by 226% YoY. 
Drug safety assessment and SMO business experienced revenue growth of 
27.3% and 26.1% YoY, further solidifying the leading positions in their 
respective markets. ATU is working on two commercial projects and is 
advancing another two potential commercial projects. Starting to receive 
royalty income in 2023, DDSU obtained NMPA approvals for three new 
drugs developed for its customers with another two in NDA review stage. 
 WuXi AppTec is actively cooperating with its customers to ensure 
business continuity. The management of WuXi AppTec has reaffirmed 
their position, stressing that the company is not involved in the human 
genomics sector and maintains no ties with any political entities, 
governments, or military organizations, thereby not posing national security 
threats to any nation. The management also emphasized that WuXi 
AppTec's client relationships remain robust, evidenced by several 
customers entering into discussions for long-term contracts for their 
advanced-stage projects. These negotiations are made possible by the 
utilization of the "Grandfather Clause" incorporated in a revised draft bill 
brought before the US Senate.  
 Share buyback to show confidence in the Company. WuXi AppTec has 
already cancelled RMB1.2bn H-shares under its 2023 H-share Award 
Scheme. Following the completion of RMB1bn A-share repurchase in Feb 
2023, the Company is in progress to repurchase another RMB1bn A-share.  
 Maintain BUY. To factor in the uncertainties from geopolitical risks, we cut 
our TP from RMB116.01 to RMB67.53 (based on a 10-year DCF model with 
WACC of 10.73% and terminal growth of 2.0%). We forecast revenue to 
grow by -3.0%/ +10.3%/ +11.1% YoY and adjusted non-IFRS net income to 
grow by -5.5%/ +10.8%/ +12.9% YoY in 2024E/ 25E/ 26E, respectively.
