InnoLight (300308 CH) 
 
 
 
True beneficiary in AI value chain  
 
We think 2024 is set to be another solid year for both infrastructure investments 
and downstream demand continue to thrive. According to Bloomberg's 
consensus, CSP3 (comprising Amazon, Google, and Microsoft) along with Meta, 
are projected to ramp up their capex by 16.6%/7.6% YoY in 2024/2025E. We 
reaffirm our positive stance on optical transceiver players, specifically in light of 
their ongoing capacity expansion and production ramp-up of the high data rate 
optical modules, e.g., 400G/800G products. We maintain BUY on Innolight, 
with new TP of RMB136. 
Last week, TFC pre-announced its FY23 earnings, with NP growth of 68-88% 
YoY to RMB677-758mn. The robust performance was primarily driven by the 
lofty demand for AI computing power in data centers, boosting sales of TFC’s 
high speed optical modules. TFC’s performance underscored our confidence in 
Innolight, one of our top picks as a true beneficiary in AI value chain.  
Considering greater-than-expected ramp-up of TSMC’s CoWoS capacity and 
continued strong investments in AI infrastructure, we expect Innolight’s 2024/25E 
revenue to come in better than our previous estimates. We revised up revenue 
forecasts by 22%/31% and lifted GPM to 34% and 33% for 2023E/24E/25E 
(vs. prior 32%/32%). The new TP is based on 30x 2024E P/E, which is close 
to 5-year historical average of forward P/E (vs. previously 35x, factoring in market 
sentiment). 
We recommend investors pay special attention to the forthcoming earnings of 
CSP3 & Meta next week. The focus should be on their future projections for cloud 
revenue and capex guidelines, as these factors will be pivotal in understanding 
the industry's future direction.
