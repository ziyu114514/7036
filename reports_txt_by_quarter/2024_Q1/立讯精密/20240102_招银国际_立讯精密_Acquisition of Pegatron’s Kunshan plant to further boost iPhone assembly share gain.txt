Acquisition of Pegatron’s Kunshan plant to 
further boost iPhone assembly share gain  
 
Based on filings of Pegatron (iPhone OEM) on 28 Dec, Luxshare is expected to 
invest RMB 2.1bn for 62.5% stake of Pegatron’s iPhone assembly plant in 
Kunshan. After the deal close, Luxshare will become the 2nd largest iPhone 
assembler with 35%+ share after Foxconn, and Pegatron will target to reallocate 
resources and regional production capacity. Despite recent macro headwinds 
and iPhone’s pressure from Huawei’s comeback, we believe Luxshare is well-
positioned for further share gain across Apple’s iPhone/ Watch/AirPods/Vision 
Pro supply chain in FY24/25E. We are positive on Luxshare’s synergy with 
recent acquisitions, fast-growing auto/comm. business and better operating 
efficiency in FY24/25E. The stock is trading at 22.2x/17.6x FY23/24E P/E (1-sd 
below 5-yr avg. P/E). Maintain BUY with the same TP of RMB46.96 (based on 
24x FY24E P/E). Upcoming catalysts include Vision Pro ramp-up and auto tier-
1 progress. 
 Luxshare to acquire Pegatron’s iPhone assembly plant in Kunshan, 
boosting iPhone assembly share. Luxshare will invest RMB 2.1bn in the 
Kunshan plant for 62.5% stake as capital expansion, and Pegatron’s stake 
in the facility will drop to 37.5%. After the expansion into iPhone assembly 
business since iPhone 14 Series, Luxshare has been gaining shares with 
order win of three iPhone 15 models in 2023, including premium 15 Pro. 
Foxconn, Pegatron and Luxshare are the three major iPhone assemblers 
with share allocation of 60%, 25% and 15%, based on our estimates. After 
the deal close, we believe Luxshare will surpass Pegatron to become the 
2nd largest iPhone assembler after Foxconn.  
 Accelerated share gain across Apple product lines and strong outlook 
in auto/comm segments. Luxshare pre-announced FY23E net income 
growth at 17.5-22.5% YoY in 3Q23 earnings release, implying 31% YoY 
growth in 4Q23 (vs 15% in 3Q). We believe stronger earnings in 4Q23 was 
a result of Luxshare’s share gain in top module/ smartphone OEM biz and 
higher share allocation of high-end models, and we are positive on further 
iPhone OEM business upside in FY24/25E post Kunshan plant acquisition. 
In addition, comm./auto tier-1 business are poised to deliver solid growth 
and better margins with order wins and product portfolio expansion.  
 Attractive risk/reward; Reiterate BUY. We are positive on Luxshare’s 
share gain across Apple product lines and robust auto/comm. outlook, and 
market concerns on Huawei’s comeback are overdone. The stock is trading 
at 22.2x/17.6x FY23/24E P/E, close to 1-SD below 5-year hist. avg. P/E. 
Reiterate BUY with the same TP of RMB46.96 (24x FY24E P/E).

Valuation  
Reiterate BUY with TP of RMB 46.96. 
We maintain our 12m TP of RMB 46.96, which is based on the same 24x FY24E P/E. We 
believe this is justified as Luxshare continues to deliver resilient earnings growth, market 
share gain and product expansion to capture Apple and NEV opportunities in the next 3-5 
years.   
Upcoming catalysts include share gain in Apple products, Vision Pro ramp-up and auto tier-
1 progress. Major risks include weaker iPhone/AirPods demand, weaker yield improvement 
and slower integration of acquired businesses.
