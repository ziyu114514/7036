ZTE (000063 CH) 
 
 
 
Improved margins in 2023 
 
ZTE released its FY23 results. Revenue grew by 1.1% YoY to RMB124bn, in line 
with consensus and 3% higher than our forecast. Net profit increased by 15.4% 
YoY to RMB9.3bn, 5% lower than consensus and in line with our forecasts. Gross 
margin for 2023 was 41.5%, representing a 434bps increase from FY22. NPM 
showed a similar trend, reaching 7.5% in FY23 from 4.2%/5.9%/6.6% in FY20-22. 
ZTE’s profitability improved steadily as a result of the company’s continued efforts 
in operation optimization and cost reduction (i.e., self-developed components). 
 For 4Q23, the company's revenue grew by 14.7% YoY and 21.5% QoQ, while 
its net profit grew by 17.8% YoY and fell by 37.3% QoQ, respectively. The 
sequential decline was mainly due to 1) a lower GPM (36.0% in Q4 vs. 44.6% 
in Q3) on a less favorable revenue mix, which was partially offset by cost 
optimization with in-house designed components in Consumer/Government 
and Enterprise segments, 2) a 42.5% increase in SG&A in Q4 on higher 
employee benefits and marketing. 
 By segment, 1) revenue from Carrier segment increased by 3.4% YoY on 
domestic market share gains in RAN and non-RAN businesses and overseas 
progress. 2) Consumer segment sales declined by 1.3% YoY on overseas 
inventory digestion and intensified competition, partially offset by domestic 
growth in family network business. 3) Enterprise & gov't segment sales 
declined by 7.1% YoY in 2023 due to a slowdown in investment. 
 Looking ahead to 2024, we believe ZTE is poised to capitalize on emerging 
trends in the telecom industry, focusing on the evolution towards 5.5G/6G and 
AI compute power. Maintain BUY on ZTE (000063 CH) with adjusted TP at 
RMB34.2, based on 15x 2024E P/E, which is close to its 3-year avg. (vs. 
previous 16.5x, considering potential downside risk from continued industry 
headwinds and slower-than-expected development in AI). Next catalyst may 
be telecom operators' capex outlook.
