wave

among the TOP10 gold mines in the country. Asset injection from the
parent group is expected to support the rapid growth of the Company's
future gold production, while acquisition of Barrick Gold Corporation's
Veladero Gold Mine has kick started the Company's global expansion
strategy. As the purest target in the domestic gold industry, the Company
has seen a visible increase in its valuation during the gold price rising
cycle. We give a 17x EV/EBITDA valuation for the Company, corresponding
Chief Non-ferrous
to a reasonable market cap of Rmb84.1bn next year. We raise the target
Metal
price to Rmb3.80, and retain our "BUY" rating.
A leader with purest business in the gold industry enjoys a big upside for
valuation. Gold business respectively accounts for 99% and 95 of the
Company's aggregate operating revenue and gross margin. As the purest gold
target in China, the Company's market performance is highly correlated with
gold price. The Company's valuation level is expected to increase significantly
in the gold price rising cycle, and the Company's future gold production growth
is highly deterministic, which further supports its valuation level.
Excellent resource endowment supports the Company's rapid growth in
gold mines in China, with 850 tonnes in gross gold reserves and a gold output
of 29.39 tonnes in 2017, ranking first in the country. Their mining costs are
lower than the average in China. All these four main mines have plans to
expand production in the future. Meanwhile, Shandong Gold Group, a major
shareholder of the Company, has remarkable reserve increases, with gold
reserves as high as 1,700 tonnes. In 2017, its output of gold outside the listed
company stood at 5.3 tonnes. With the injection of assets from the parent
group, the Company's gold production will see direct growth in the future, with
its long-term output expected to reach 50 tonnes, which will support the
Company's rapid earnings growth.
Acquisition of Veladero Gold Mine kick starts global expansion. The
Company acquired Barrick Gold Corporation's Veladero Gold Mine in 2017,
which increases its gold reserves to 987 tonnes. Veladero Gold Mine is
expected to contribute more than 9 tonnes to the Company's gold output in
2018. The injection of mature gold assets supports the rapid growth of the
Company's gold production and earnings, which will open up its strategic
expansion worldwide and offer a broad upside for future growth.
Potential risks: Gold price volatility, and less-than-expected gold production.
Investment advice: Fast-growing gold production and an upward gold price
cycle combine to significantly push up the Company's earnings. Given the
Company's fair value change in 2018 and potential incremental gold assets in
2020, we lift our forecasts for the Company's 2018-2020 attribute net profits to
Rmb1,204mn/1,652mn/ 2,070mn, implying EPS of Rmb0.54/0.75/0.94 (vs.
former EPS forecasts of Rmb0.61/0.75/0.87) respectively. Taking into account
the increases in debts and financial costs due to the acquisition of overseas
gold mine, we adopt an EV/EBITDA method to evaluate the Company.
Considering the reasonable premium of the Company as the purest gold
target in China, we raise its target price to Rmb38.0, corresponding to a
market cap of Rmb84.1bn. We retain our "BUY" rating.
