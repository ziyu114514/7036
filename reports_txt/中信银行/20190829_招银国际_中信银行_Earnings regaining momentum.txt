■ Results positives: 1) Loan growth accelerated to 6.3% in 1H19 (vs 5.7%
in 1H18), primarily boosted by retail segment (+11.0% HoH), esp. mortgage
and credit card. That said, asset quality of retail loans was well controlled, as
retail NPL ratio edged down 10bp HoH to 0.9%. We believe higher retail
exposure (+1.8ppt HoH to 43%) would underpin a better-than-peers margin

165.2%, lower than JSBs' average of 193%. NPL balance rose 3% QoQ on
faster formation, yet NPL ratio was unchanged at 1.72%. There might be
limited room to further lower credit cost until the Bank builds a more
comfortable provision buffer. 2) 2Q19 NIM stayed flat at 1.96%, as lower
interbank funding cost was offset by higher deposit cost amid deposit
competition. Loan yield retreated 6bp HoH, due to lower yield for retail loans
and discounted bills. 3) CET-1 and total CAR fell 19bp/36bp QoQ to
8.58%/12.27%. The Bank has issued RMB 40bn CB in Mar 2019, but
conversion may take time given its below-book valuation.
