财务预测表
Summary
Investment Highlights:
Considering rapid AI server growth, we raise revenue forecasts but slightly lower profit due to structural impact, maintaining
an 'Outperform' rating. We project 2025-2027 revenue at RMB 141.3 billion, RMB 161.9 billion, RMB 184.1 billion, with net
profit attributable to shareholders at RMB 8.06 billion, RMB 8.97 billion, RMB 10.28 billion, and EPS at RMB 1.68, RMB 1.87,
RMB 2.15. Based on comparable company valuations, we assign a 2025 PE of 40x, with a target price of RMB 67.37, maintaining
'Outperform'. Revenue accelerates, but structural changes pressure GPM. 25H1 revenue is RMB 71.55 billion, up 14.51% YoY,
with net profit attributable to shareholders at RMB 5.06 billion, down 11.77% YoY, GPM at 32.45%, down 8.02 pct YoY, NPM at
7.07%, down 2.11 pct YoY. 25Q2 revenue is RMB 38.59 billion, up 20.92% YoY, 17.04% QoQ, with net profit attributable to
shareholders at RMB 2.60 billion, down 12.94% YoY, up 6.16% QoQ, GPM at 30.90%, down 8.09 pct YoY, 3.38 pct QoQ. Second
growth curve business doubles, Al servers enter volume increase phase. Revenue from second curve, led by computing power
and terminal products, grows nearly 100% YoY, with server and storage revenue up over 200% YoY, Al server revenue share at
55%. Benefiting from high growth in servers, government and enterprise revenue is RMB 19.25 billion, up 109.93% YoY, GPM
at 8.27%, down 13.50 pct YoY. Recently, the company won the largest share in China Mobile's 2025-2026 Al general computing
equipment (inference type) centralized procurement, highlighting competitive strength. Additionally, carrier network revenue
is RMB 35.06 billion, down 5.99% YoY, GPM at 52.94%, down 1.38 pct YoY. Consumer business revenue is RMB 17.24 billion, up
7.59% YoY, GPM at 17.78%, down 1.03 pct YoY. Al full-stack capability stands out, with a major breakthrough in national
computing power. The company enhances intelligent computing product R&D, meeting diverse AI scenario needs through self-
developed chips, AI servers, and software capabilities. Core chip capabilities are prominent, with self-developed 'Dinghai' DPU,
'Lingyun' switch, 'Zhuifeng' CPU chips. At the 2025 China Computing Power Conference, the company won the annual major
breakthrough award for its intelligent computing supernode system based on GPU card high-speed interconnect open
architecture and self-developed 'Lingyun' AI switch chip. We believe the company can further strengthen its long-term
competitive strength in AI with industry-leading chip design capabilities.
Risk Warning: Intensified market competition; second growth curve business growth weaker than expected; innovation
business expansion weaker than expected.

海通国际 A 股覆盖：海通国际可能会就沪港通及深港通的中国 A 股进行覆盖及评级。国泰海通证券（601211.CH），海通国际于上海的母公司，也会于中国发布中国 A 股的研究报告。

HAITONG SECURITIES (601211 CH), the ultimate parent company of HTISG based in Shanghai, covers and publishes research on these same A-Shares for distribution in mainland China. However, the
rating system employed by GTHS differs from that used by HTI and as a result there may be a difference in the HTI and GTHS ratings for the same A-share stocks.
