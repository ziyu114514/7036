due to unfavorable product mix (i.e., lower contribution from high-margin carrier
segment). NPM improved seguentially to 9.4% (vs. 9% / 7.5% in 1Q24/FY23) in

Shareholding Structure
Given RAN business accounted for more than half of ZTE's carrier business
sales, the Company's carrier revenue fell by 8.6% YoY to RMB37.3bn in
1H24. Carrier's GPM remained strong at 54.3% in 1H24 (vs. 54.4%/44.2%
in 1H/2H23). Overall, the Company's GPM was stable at 40.5% in 1H24 (vs.

demand on FTTR market and recovering consumer electronics demand.
Govt/enterprise revenue growth was driven by a surge in server and

memory storage sales, however, these relatively low-margin products put
pressure on the segment's GPM (21.8% in 1H24 vs. 34.9% in 2023).
Looking forward, we expect these segments will maintain decent growth, as
the spending of consumer and enterprises may continue to recover.
Maintain BUY on ZTE. TP adjusted to RMB32.86, based on 15x FY24E
P/E, which equals to its 3-year historical avg. We revised down our
revenue forecasts by 3%/2% for FY24/25E, given continuous headwinds

from domestic telecom market (lower spending in RAN). We trimmed net
profit forecasts by 3%/7% on lower GPM but partially offsetting by better
operating efficiency. Potential downside risks include 1) Sino-US trade
tensions, 2) softer capex of domestic telcos and overseas 5G deployment
delays, 3) weaker-than-expected consumer/enterprises' spending.
