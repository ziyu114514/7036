可比公司估值表
财务报表分析和预测
Summary
The company released its 2023 annual report and 2024 first quarter report, and the performance growth was in line with
expectations. In 2023, the company will achieve revenue of 344.500 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of -6.33%, and a net
profit attributable to the parent company of 11.944 billion yuan, a year-on-year increase of -1.99%, of which Q4 will achieve a
revenue of 89.484 billion yuan, a month-on-month increase of 5.08% and a year-on-year increase of -0.05%, and a net profit
attributable to the parent company of 3.594 billion yuan, a month-on-month increase of -5.37% and a year-on-year increase of
31.99%. In 24Q1, the company achieved revenue of 80.814 billion yuan, -9.69% month-on-month and 2.81% year-on-year, and net
profit attributable to the parent company of 1.926 billion yuan, -46.41% month-on-month and 4.39% year-on-year.
The operating performance rose against the trend, and the product differentiation continued to strengthen. In the context of
the downturn in the steel market, the company's export orders will hit a record high in 2023, achieving a total profit of 15.09 billion
yuan, maintaining the first place in the domestic industry in terms of operating performance, and outperforming the industry
market by 12.8%. In 2023, the sales volume of "1 1 N" products will be 27.92 million tons, an increase of 10% year-on-year, and
cold-rolled automotive steel will be rated as the seventh batch of single champion products in the manufacturing industry of the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology.
The results of cost reduction and efficiency increase have been remarkable, and the business resilience of Pugang's leading
enterprises has been highlighted. In 2023, the company will achieve steel sales of 51.9 million tons, a year-on-year increase of
4.3%, the price per ton of steel will be about 5,240 yuan/ton, a year-on-year decrease of 9.83%, the cost of steel per ton will be
about 5,034 yuan/ton, a year-on-year decrease of 10.26%, and the gross profit per ton of steel will be about 206 yuan/ton, a year-
on-year increase of 2.34%. In Q1 2024, the company will achieve cost reduction of 2.24 billion yuan, which strongly supports the
company's operating performance to outperform the industry market.
Promote the action of "improving quality and efficiency and emphasizing returns" to safeguard the rights and interests of all
yuan per share in the second half of 2023, and the total expected dividends in 2023 will be 6.781 billion yuan, accounting for 56.77%
of the net profit attributable to shareholders of the parent company in the consolidated statements; 2) Increase the frequency of
dividends, and take the medium-term and annual profit distribution plan as a long-term dividend policy;3) Timely dynamic
repurchase, as of the end of March 2024, the company has repurchased 342 million shares through centralized bidding
transactions, and the total amount paid is 2.089 billion yuan, and the company will continue to promote the share repurchase plan
to enhance investor confidence and maintain the company's investment value.
In 2024, we will strive to achieve "No. 1 in business performance in China". Specific targets include: "1 1 N" product sales volume
of 30 million tons, export sales ratio of more than 10%, cost reduction of more than 3 billion yuan month-on-month, technical
energy saving of 300,000 tons of standard coal, "scene Al" application ≥ 100, major projects to achieve node goals. In 2024, the
company plans to produce 49.06 million tons of iron, 51.5 million tons of steel, and 52.22 million tons of commodity billets, with
a total operating income of 330.2 billion yuan and an operating cost of 303.4 billion yuan.
Earnings forecasts and valuations. We expect the company's EPS from 2024 to 2026 to be 0.61, 0.66 and 0.70 yuan respectively.
Considering the leading position of Baosteel shares, based on the 2024 EPS and referring to the valuation of comparable companies,
we give a PE valuation of 14 times in 2024, corresponding to a reasonable value of 8.54 yuan, and maintain an "OUTPERFORM"
rating.
Risk Warning. The risk of large fluctuations in raw materials. Downstream demand is less than expected. The risk that the crude
steel production restriction policy exceeds expectations.
ESG Comments
