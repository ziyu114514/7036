2Q17 net profit beat on strong sales growth and expense control
Research Analyst
Wuliangye reported 2Q17 results with 23.3% yoy sales increase to RMB5462m
and 40.1% net profit yoy increase to RMB1378m. Sales and NPAT was 10%/17%
higher than our estimates, mainly due to better than expected sales volume and

profit increased 28% yoy in 1H17.
Sales increased 23.3% yoy in 2Q17 (vs 15.1% yoy in 1Q17), helped by
increasing demand thanks to Moutai's under-supply and Wuliangye's ex-
factory price hike (Wuliangye raised ex-factory price from Rmb659/bottle
to Rmb679/bottle in March and to Rmb739 in September 2016)
Business tax and surcharges/sales increased 420bps yoy to 12.2% in
2Q17, mainly due to increasing consumption tax base. According to the
new tax regulation No.218 issued by Sichuan tax bureau, the tax base
could be increased to 70% of the ex-factory price sold to distributors
Price/price relative
compared to previously c.50%, based on our estimates.
If excluding the tax impact, gross margin improved 340bps to 73.7% in
2Q17 as a result of ex-factory price hike and better product mix.
SG&A/sales ratio declined 750bps to 28.7%, helped by lower operating
leverage and stronger cost control.

Advance from customer balance increase 25% yoy to Rmb5.5bn in
1H17, indicating increasing confidence from consumer demands.
We expect Wuliangye's net profit continue to speed up for three reasons. Firstly,
Moutai's retail price hike and under-supply will drive the consumers' demand shift
to Wuliangye. Secondly, increasing channel re-stocking demand from distributors
as the retail price are recovering to over Rmb900/bottle (vs Rmb739's ex-factory
price). Thirdly, the margin continue to improve helped by price hike, lower
channel rebate and stronger cost control. Considering the impact from increasing
consumption tax basis, we expect the net profit growth to speed up from 28%
yoy in 1H17 to 33% in 2H17.
Revise up target price by 13% to Rmb62; reiterating Buy
We revised up net profit by 5-9% in 2017-19E, which is to factor in a better growth
in high-end liquor and stronger expense control, while partly offset by higher
consumption tax basis. We revised up target price by 13% to Rmb62, based on
13.8x 2018E EV/EBITDA, slightly higher than our old valuation of 13.4x, mainly
due to our more optimistic opinion of the company. We reiterate Buy. Downside
risks: 1) macro deterioration ; 2) government's increasing measure on anti high-
end liquor consumption.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to
specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at https://
