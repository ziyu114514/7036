Company Note
China Vanke-A
China
Upgrade to Add on attractive valuation
ADD (previously HOLD)
Vanke's 1H18 core net profit rose 44% yoy to Rmb10.4bn, 15% above our estimate,
on the back of higher-than-expected revenue and gross margin.
We expect gross margin (post land appreciation tax, LAT) to stay at a high level of 25-
27% over FY18-20F.
We believe the major overhang on its share price has been removed as Baoneng has
in the past few months already disposed of an 8% stake in it (vs. target of 10%).
Vanke has a sizeable Rmb520bn of sold but unrecognised sales. We estimate it has
already locked in over 95%/65% of FY18F/FY19F earnings.
Upgrade to Add in view of its attractive valuation. Our TP of Rmb35.0 is unchanged.
1H18's core earnings beat our estimate by 15%
Vanke announced a stronger-than-expected set of results, with core net profit rising 44%
yoy to Rmb10.4bn, 15% ahead our estimate, on the back of higher-than-expected volume
and gross margin. No interim dividend was declared as usual. Net gearing increased
from 9% at end-2017 to 33% at end-Jun, primarily due to one-off expenses to take Global
Logistic Properties private.
Contracted sales could see 31% yoy growth in FY18F
Key changes in this note
In 7M18, Vanke grew its contracted sales by 12% yoy to Rmb350bn. Given that it will
FY18F EPS increased by 5%.
\mathbf{z}
have more sellable resources in 2H18F, we estimate that Vanke should be able to
FY19F EPS increased by 5%.
achieve total contracted sales of Rmb695bn in FY18F, representing 31% yoy growth.
\rightarrow
FY20F EPS increased by 5%.
Gross margin to stay at 25-27% over FY18-20F
Its gross margin (post land appreciation tax, LAT) for 1H18 came in at 27.4%, up 2.1%
pts yoy and 1.9% pts above our estimate, driven by bookings of relatively high profit
margin projects in 1H18 and recovery of the overall property market since 2016. We
expect its gross margin to be maintained at 25-27% over FY18-20F, supported by rapid
price hikes for its property projects.
Overhang on Vanke removed
In Apr 2018, it was reported that Baoneng Group plans to dispose of a 10% stake in
Vanke-A. In the subsequent months, Baoneng reduced its stake in Vanke-A by about 8%,
according to the latter's stock exchange's announcements (refer to Figure 2 for more
details). This suggests that it only has a c.2% stake to be disposed of in the coming
months (total consideration of c.Rmb5bn at current share price). As such, we believe the
major overhang on its share price has been removed.
Huge unbooked sales secure earnings for FY18F and FY19F
As at Jun, Vanke has a sizeable Rmb520bn of sold but unrecognised sales; we expect
most of these to be recognised in 2H18F and FY19F. As such, we assess that Vanke has
already locked in over 95% of FY18F earnings and 65% of FY19F earnings.
Upgrade to Add on attractive valuations
We raise our EPS estimates by 5% for FY18-20F after updating the property completion
schedule. Our target price of Rmb35.0 is based on par to NAV. We upgrade to Add on
attractive valuations. Vanke-A is currently trading at 33% discount to NAV, 6x FY19F P/E
and 5% dividend yield, which looks appealing, in our view. Potential re-rating catalysts
include stronger-than-expected contracted sales. Key downside risks are a slowdown in
China's economy, and further tightening policies imposed by the government.
