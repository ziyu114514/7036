财务报表分析和预测
Summary
In 2025H1, recurring net profit increased by 58.7% YoY. In 25H1, the company's operating revenue
\triangleright
increased by 35.0% YoY to 22.82 billion yuan; the net profit increased by 73.0% YoY to 5.72 billion
yuan; and the recurring net profit increased by 58.7% YoY to 5.58 billion yuan. In 2025Q2, the
company's operating revenue was 12.05 billion yuan (YoY +39.0%); net profit was 3.28 billion yuan
(YoY +74.2%); and net profit was 2.98 billion yuan (YoY +46.6%). In 2025H1, the company's main
product, polyolefin (including EVA), had a production capacity of 2.4046 million tonnes (YoY +96.64%).
The coke production capacity was 3.418 million tonnes, which was basically the same YoY.
The new project has been successfully implemented, with significant contributions from the new
\triangleright
production capacity. The Inner Mongolia 2.6 million tonne/year coal-to-olefin project, which supports the
production of 400,000 tonnes/year of green hydrogen-coupled olefin, has been completed and is
operating as planned, having fully reached production capacity. In the first half of the year, the project
produced 1,163,500 tonnes of polyolefin, accounting for 48.39% of the company's total polyolefin
production. It is currently the world's largest single-plant coal-to-olefin project, and the first to use green
hydrogen and modern coal chemical collaborative production technology to produce olefins on a large
scale. Following completion of the project, the company's olefin production capacity reached 5.2 million
tonnes per year, making it the largest in China's coal-to-olefin industry. The Inner Mongolia olefin
project demonstrates the application of multiple large-scale pieces of heavy machinery with
independent intellectual property rights in China, with a localisation rate of over 98%. Adopting the most
advanced DMTO-III technology, the project leverages its location, technological and investment
advantages to further reduce production costs and enhance core competitiveness. Secondly, the
100,000-tonne-per-year vinyl acetate project achieved a successful one-time start-up and smooth
production. This realises an independent supply of the main raw materials for the EVA unit, ensuring
their quality and stable supply, and laying a solid foundation for the coordinated development of the
enterprise's industrial chain and cost optimisation. Thirdly, the OCC device achieved a successful one-
time start-up and produced products with all indicators meeting the required standards.
\triangleright
The ongoing projects are progressing smoothly and the reserve projects are being actively promoted.
Construction of the Ningdong Phase IV olefin project began in April 2025, and is progressing well. As of
the end of July, 24% of the design drawings had been completed, 80% of the equipment had been
ordered, 80% of the civil foundation construction had been completed, 35% of the civil main frame
construction had been completed, and the steel structure had fully started the production of drawings
for further development. The project is planned for completion and operation by the end of 2026.
Secondly, the preliminary work on the Xinjiang and Inner Mongolia Phase II olefin projects is actively
underway.
\triangleright
billion yuan, and 14.11 billion yuan. Considering the valuation of comparable companies in the same
industry, we have given the company PE of 12x for 2025, which corresponds to TP of RMB19.32. We
initiate with the company with a "Buy" rating.
Risk warning. The project's progress is slower than expected, and demand from downstream is lower
than expected.
