PM Summary: Undervalued out-of-home leader
Focus Media is the market share leader in inner-building and cinema pre-show advertising,
with strong bargaining power over downstream players, which supports levered earnings growth.
Our outlook for a growing audience for this advertising driven by more office buildings/residential
properties in cities and increased movie attendance make us incrementally more positive on the
company and lead us to raise our EPS estimates by up to 9% to reflect higher revenue and
margins. We also increase our terminal year P/E to 20X from 18X, now referencing international
peers' historical average (previously, we referenced our China media coverage). We believe the
market is bearish about the overhang of selling pressure due to unlocking from restrictions, and
consider the stock undervalued trading at a 20X 2017 P/E, lower than international peers at 23X,
given its higher growth, higher margin and stronger cash flow profile. We upgrade Focus Media
to Buy from Neutral with a 12-month target price of Rmb16.26 implying 29% upside, among
the highest in our China media coverage.
Inner-building advertising: High-value "life circle" media
Focus Media's revenue from LCD media and poster frame media has seen stable growth (+13%
in 2014-16), broadly in line with overall advertising spending growth in China, and we also expect
a 13% CAGR in 2016-21E (still in line with industry growth), driven by more office buildings and
residential properties in cities. We think the reason for the stable growth is due to: (1) Exposure to
a captive audience: Focus Media's ad resources are usually installed in elevators, which are
small enclosed spaces, and are more likely to attract people's attention; (2) A growing audience:
Supply of office building and residential building in large cities will not decelerate; (3) Most of
Focus Media's audience are high income middle class with high purchasing power; (4) We
believe Focus Media offers effective/economically viable ways to drive a brand's penetration in a
short period of time.
Cinema pre-show ads: A fast growing advertising media
Cinema pre-show advertising is the fastest growing segment of Focus Media. The industry grew
33%/40%/45% in 2014-16 vs. an overall ad spending CAGR in China of +18% over the same
period, driven by rising movie viewership (35%/52%/9% yoy in 2014-16). The future driver of the
industry lies in stable growth in viewership (11% CAGR through 2020E), and higher advertising
coverage (40% of screens in China have advertising coverage in 2016 vs. our expectation of 65%
in 2021E).
Focus Media has a 63% share of the cinema pre-show ad market as of 2016, ahead of the other
two large players Wanda Media and Jingmao. Though competition is still intense, we think Focus
Media's market share will increase slightly because of its position as an independent agency able
to sign up cinemas from various cinema investment companies.
Diversified revenue sources and strong bargaining power
In the last few years, the revenue contribution from internet industry clients has increased from
16% in 2014 to 26% in 2016, thanks to the growth of the internet industry. While the internet will
continue to be an important contributor, we think Focus Media's revenue sources are diversified
into multiple industries and the company is thus relatively immune from industry specific risk.
We think the ultimate driver is growth of the advertising industry and economy. In the past four
years, Focus Media's share of China's advertising industry has been stable at about 2%. We think
inner building ads and cinema ads remain two valuable advertising media and Focus Media will
continue to grow in step with the industry. Focus Media has 90%/70%/63% market shares in inner
building LCDs / poster frames / cinema pre-show advertising as of 2016, while its downstream is
very fragmented. As a result, Focus Media's bargaining power is strong, which leads to low cost
inflation.
2017年5月31日
分众传媒 (002027.SZ)
Attractive vs. global peers, given stronger fundamentals
We raise 2017-21E EPS by 6-9% to reflect higher revenue and higher margins driven by a
growing audience. We also adjust our 2021E exit P/E multiple to 20X from 18X, referencing
historical-average international peer valuations, and discount back to 2017E using 8% sector
COE (still in line with our China media coverage). Compared with international peers, Focus
Media has higher growth, higher margins and stronger cash flow, and having increased
the dividend payout ratio from 32% in 2015 to 80% in 2016, its 2017E dividend yield comes to c.
4%, in line with the average of international peers. Accordingly, we now believe the stock merits
valuation in line with their average multiple in the long term. With our estimate changes and
multiple adjustment, we raise our 12-month target price to Rmb16.26, from Rmb13.48.
We consider the stock undervalued trading at a 20X 2017E P/E, compared with its 2-year
historical average of 29X (26X excluding the period from November 2015 to January 2016 when
the media sector as a whole rallied), and the average for international peers of 23X.

Cross check with DDM valuation
Focus Media raised its dividend payout ratio to 80% in 2016 and we believe the payout ratio is
likely to be maintained given its large cash balance. We thus cross check our valuation
methodology by deriving theoretical value based on 10-year dividend discount model (DDM),
assuming the same sector COE of 8% that we use for our target price, and a terminal growth rate
of 2.5% to reflect long term GDP growth. We find that DDM yields a similar per-share value (Rmb
16.59) to our current target price (Exhibit 11).

Inner-building advertising: High-value "life circle" media
After a decade of rollout, Focus Media today operates an LCD advertising network in more than
installed units. Given that the ASP of inner-building media in Tier 1 cities and Tier 3 cities can
differ by 4-8X (Tier 1 and 2 cities have taller office buildings and more higher-income earners),
and over 50%/40% of inner building media revenues are from Tier 1/2 cities, we believe the key
driver of growth, at least in the next couple of years, will remain Tier 1/2 cities rather than
penetration into Tier 3/4 cities, which we estimate have a much lower advertising value (i.e.
market revenue).
Whether it's penetrating new lower-tier cities, increasing more screens in higher-tier cities, or
hiking ad prices once or twice every year, Focus Media has been increasing its supply. However,
supply is not the dominating driver of growth; it is demand that ultimately determines which
markets the company can aim to penetrate.
On the demand side, a key question is whether the rise of new media, such as mobile internet,
could gradually replace all other traditional media. Newspaper, magazine and TV ads have
undergone a significant decline in ad revenue in China (-10% to 0% per year in the last three
years), while inner-building media still maintains stable growth, as evidenced by a 13% revenue
CAGR in the past two years for Focus Media in this category. During 2012-2016, inner-building
media segment revenue grew from Rmb5.1bn to Rmb7.8bn (78% of total 2016 revenue). The
11% CAGR over this period was broadly in line with overall ad expenditure in China during this
period, suggesting stable share in the advertising market.
Overall, we expect revenue from inner-building advertising to grow at a 13% CAGR in 2016-
21E, driven by a growing audience and superior media format. This segment is an important
driver of the company's topline, as inner-building media accounted for about 75% of revenue
in 2016. Given the company's strong bargaining power and operating leverage, we expect higher
revenue to drive margin expansion, and we raise our margin forecasts for this segment to 76-79%
for 2017-21E, from 75% on average over 2014-2016.
So why can inner-building media, or what Focus Media refers to as "life circle ad media"
maintain a stable share of corporate advertising budgets, and why has this media been
accelerating in the past two years? We think one of the most important reasons is the high value
this format offers, based on several merits.
Exposure to a captive audience: Focus Media's display resources are highly exposed to
people's lives. Its ads are placed in locations highly visible to people entering and exiting
residential buildings and office buildings via elevators, as well as people going to the cinema.
Moreover, office and residential building elevators in China tend to be small enclosed spaces
inconvenient for conversation; apart from looking at mobile phones, display screens or poster
frames inside such elevators are the only items to capture people's attention. We believe ads
displayed on such media in such locations have a higher chance of being viewed, with
potential to leave a deeper impression on people's minds.
cities will increase at 12% in 2016-20E, compared with 11% in 2012-16. According to the
National Bureau of Statistics, residential building area in large cities increased about 4-5% in
2013-16. Considering about half of existing residential buildings do not have elevators, and
almost all newly built residential buildings do, we estimate that the area of elevator-enabled
buildings has increased more than 10% per year in the past few years. We believe a growing
audience will create higher advertising value, and drive revenue growth of Focus Media.
(3) Targeted higher-income middle class: Focus Media's ad media are located in office
buildings, elevator-enabled residential buildings and cinemas, and thus are exposed to
2017年5月31日
分众传媒 (002027.SZ)
people with higher-than-average income. As such, we believe Focus Media's ad resources
are of higher value and more attractive to advertisers.
(4) Lower price than TV ads and online ad streaming. According to CTR Market Research,
Focus Media's CPM (cost per mille impressions) in multiple cities is lower than the CPM of
local television stations, and also cheaper than online ad streaming, making it more
economical to advertise on Focus Media.
(5) Highly effective way of building new brands. Given the above, we believe Focus
Media's display resources are the most effective way to make a brand popular all over China
in a short space of time. According to WPP's BrandZ 2016 report on the top 100 most
valuable Chinese brands, in the last two years, 81% of the top 100 brands in China have
placed their ads on Focus Media's network, suggesting the high value of Focus Media's
advertising network.

Cinema pre-show ads: A fast growing advertising media
Increased market penetration key
Cinema advertising is the fastest growing segment of Focus Media, with revenue up
65%/42%/51% yoy in 2014-16 and on our estimates set to grow a further 22% over 2016-2021E.
In cinema advertising, Focus Media rents pre-show time slots from cinema operators and sell the
slots to advertisers and agencies. The core competitive advantage of Focus Media lies in a
network effect backed by its leading market share in cinema advertising and broad client
base. As of 2016, Focus Media covers more than 1,500+ cinemas and 10,000+ screens,
accounting for 24% of total screens in China (up from 21% in 2015). In the future, Focus Media
plans to further increase its screen coverage by penetrating into lower tier cities and signing more
partners. We expect its screen penetration will increase to 40% in 2021E, from 24% as of 2016.
Moreover, we expect stable margins on leading market share and relatively strong bargaining
power.
Pre-show cinema ads are one of the fastest growing ad segments in China as a whole, with
revenue rising 33%/40%/45% in 2014-16 versus the total advertising market in China growing at
about a 17% CAGR over the same period. The rapid growth of the cinema advertising industry is
driven by rising movie viewership (35%/52%/9% yoy in 2014-16) thanks to the booming movie
market in China. The captive nature of cinema advertising also underlies the high value of cinema
ads, in our view.
The future driver of the industry lies in the stable growth of China's movie industry and viewership,
the latter of which we forecast to grow at an 11% CAGR through 2020. Another driver is higher
advertising coverage. As of 2016, only 40% of screens in China have advertising coverage, and
most of them are in Tier 1 and Tier 2 cities. However, we expect the coverage to increase to 65%
by 2021E, thanks to major players increasing their screen penetration.
In the US, growth of pre-show ads is also in line with movie box office growth. In 2016, the pre-
show ad market size was about 7% of box office revenue, up from 6% in 2012. As noted by the
Cinema Advertising Council (CAC) in its 2016 report, the high value of cinema ads resides in the
high ratio of millennial moviegoers, which is considered valuable to advertisers.

Competitive landscape: Consolidated but still intense
The market structure of cinema pre-show ads is somewhat consolidated. Focus Media is the
largest player with a 63% market share in 2016. Wanda Media, a subsidiary of Wanda Film
(002739.SZ) is the second largest player, and the third player Jingmao is a subsidiary of
Changyou (CYOU, Coverage Suspended).
Though Focus Media leads with network advantage, competition in the industry is still intense.
Wanda Media covers pre-show ads of all cinemas operated by Wanda Film. As Wanda Film will
grow its self-owned cinemas very quickly (32%/21% in 2017/18E, according to our estimate) and
will also have cinemas from CJ CGV and Bona Cinema joining its network, we expect the
resource growth of Wanda Media to be very rapid. Moreover, China Film (600977.SS, Not
Covered) also has eyes on the cinema ad business, though its market share is still less than 2%
(as of 2016).
Despite competition, we think Focus Media's market share will slightly increase, because Wanda
Media and China Film mostly operate their own cinemas and it would be difficult for them to sign
cinemas from other cinema investment companies due to the competitive relationship. In
comparison, Focus Media as an independent agency can sign cinemas from various cinema
2017年5月31日
分众传媒 (002027.SZ)
investment companies, thus gaining access to a bigger market. As cinema investment companies
are still fragmented and the consolidation process is still slow, we do not see any material threat
to Focus Media's market share.

Diversified revenue sources and strong bargaining power
Rising revenue contribution from the internet – a blessing or a concern?
In the last few years, the revenue contribution from internet industry clients has increased from
16% in 2014 to 26% in 2016, thanks to the growth of the internet industry. We note some
concerns over this mix change: some worry that fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) and autos,
which used to be Focus Media's most important client source, would be a drag in the future; some
also worry that reliance on internet industry clients may subject the company to a revenue
slowdown if the internet industry slows down.
Focus Media's revenue sources are diversified into multiple industries and the company is thus
relatively immune from industry specific risk (Exhibit 28). Revenue from FMCG and the auto
industry is stable. For the internet industry, Focus Media benefits from competition among internet
companies, like Didi Dache vs. Kuaidi Dache, Eleme vs. Baidu Delivery, etc. The trends and
hotspots change rather quickly, but there will always be new trends emerging and new companies
coming to advertise on Focus Media, for example the recent emergence of bike sharing company
Ofo. As long as the internet remains popular, Focus Media's revenue growth is unlikely to be
compromised, in our opinion.
We think the ultimate driver is the growth of the advertising industry and the economy. In the past
four years, Focus Media's share of China's advertising industry has been stable at about 2%. We
think inner building ads and cinema ads remain two valuable advertising media and Focus Media
will continue to grow in step with the industry.

Strong bargaining power leads to superior financials
Focus Media has a 90% market share in inner building LCD advertising, 70% in poster frame ads,
and 63% in cinema pre-show ads, as of 2016. However, its downstream is very fragmented. In
inner building advertising, downstream players are real estate management companies who
operate locally, with no nationwide players. In cinemas, Focus Media's downstream customers
account for about 37% of market share (Exhibit 27).
As a result, Focus Media's bargaining power is strong, which leads to low cost inflation. In 2016,
media rental costs for inner building media increased 11% yoy, while revenue increased 13% yoy,
and the gross margin of inner building media increased 0.5 ppt. The gross margin of cinema ads
also increased from 59% in 2014 to 62% in 2015, although it dropped to 61% in 2016 due to
contract renewals.
Potential M&A opportunities
The company has completed a series of acquisitions in the past two years, mainly in media
entertainment, sports and finance, including Miaopai, Shanghai DataSeed Information
Technology, and Hero Sports.
Focus Media has a large and high-income audience base, but apart from advertising, the
company has few ways to monetize the huge audience traffic. We believe that investing in media
companies could potentially give Focus Media opportunities: it could advertise the product or
service of the acquired company on its network and an audience, if interested, might potentially
purchase the product or service. Focus Media may even be able to make use of its idle
advertising slots, limiting any impairment of current advertising income.
Focus Media has abundant cash on its balance sheet (Rmb4.4bn as of 2016) and in our view is in
a position to conduct acquisitions if it chooses to. Given its broad audience, potential monetization
opportunities are promising. The company has stated that its intentions regarding M&A are to
realize higher monetization of its audience traffic and find new revenue sources.

Government subsidy
Focus Media receives a material amount of government subsidy every year. Most of the
government subsidy is tax refunds granted by local governments, and can be considered a
recurring stream of income. On top of this, in 2016, the company recognized a roughly
Rmb400mn one-off subsidy related to its A-share listing, and management expects another
portion will be recognized in in 2017. As the company will continue to pay taxes and is a sizable
tax contributor to local governments, we expect the recurring government subsidy to account for a
stable percentage of pretax profit in the next few years (Exhibit 33).

Key risks
Sell-off pressure from unlocked shares
On Dec 29, 2016, 3bn shares were unlocked from restriction, and on April 17, 2017, 505mn
shares were unlocked. The total shares unlocked account for 41% of the total shares of the
first date of unlocking, accounting for 16% of the unlocked shares. Selling of unlocked shares is
still underway and the shares could potentially be subject to sell-off pressure, creating an
overhang.
However, we note that the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) announced a new
regulation effective from May 27, stipulating that a given shareholder may not sell more than 3%
of a company's total shares within any consecutive 90-day period (among which no more than 1%
through bidding transaction and no more than 2% through block trading). We view this as positive
for Focus Media as we believe it could go some way to alleviating short term share sell-off
pressure.
Source: Company data
Bargaining power weakening in cinema advertising
The downstream players in cinema advertising are cinema investment companies. The market is
fragmented but there are a few large players like Dadi Cinema and Jinyi Cinema. The industry
might further consolidate, weakening Focus Media's bargaining power and posing an upside risk
to rent expenses.
Advertising dollar shifting online
In the past three years, online advertising has been growing very fast (30-40% in 2014-16),
especially mobile internet. Even though mobile penetration is already high, there is still risk that
advertisers will shift their dollar from traditional media (including out-of-home) to online, given that
online media offers a more targeted advertising service.
Pitfalls in diversification
The company has made a series of investments in areas like entertainment, finance and sports,
seeking to better monetize its user traffic and create new sources of revenue. However, its
expertise does not lie in entertainment or finance. Some of these acquisitions could fall through or
the acquired targets fail to integrate well, potentially diminishing earnings and cash returns.
