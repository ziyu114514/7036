行業蕭條期，市占率大幅提高
財政部 2016 年 12 月 30 日下發通知，將純電客車的國家補貼下調了 20 萬元每輛，地
方補貼不得高於國補的一半，並增加了滿足三萬公里運營里程的申領條件。受行業政

要覆蓋大中型客車市場，銷量也被拖累，但好於行業平均，同比僅下滑 5.24%,至
67268 輛。市占率反而得以提升，在大型客車市場佔有率為 28.8%，提升 2.9 個百分
點;中型客車市場佔有率為 44.2%,提升 4.9 個百分點;在大中型新能源客車市場佔有
率提高 3.4 個百分點至 28.3%。

期收窄 1.5 個百分點。
三費攀升
三萬公里申領條件使公司應收賬款中的國家補貼資金回款週期拉長，對公司的資金和

補貼新政下，行業洗牌利好龍頭擴張
2018 年國家新能源客車補貼政策的進一步調整，提高了行業入門難度，加速優

有率。
技術方面,公司的核心技術如節能水準處於領先地位,整車安全與控制技術、
整車輕量化技術、車聯網服務平臺等多項核心技術取得突破進展,大大提高了
產品競爭力,與 2016 年相比,整車平均能耗降低 5%以上。海外高端產品專案
順利推進,2017年公司新能源客車出口量同比增加18%至8412輛。與國外同行
相比,公司的新能源產品技術成熟度、規模化優勢顯著,且已經通過當地認
證,具備品牌和技術優勢,未來值得期待。
投資建議
總體上，雖然 2018 年產品單價或繼續承壓，但隨著行業格局進一步優化，產品
經過時間的檢驗,技術實力強、產品優質、綜合性價比高的企業將在未來新能
源客車市場中居於主導地位，海外市場也有望成爲公司業績的另一增長點。
