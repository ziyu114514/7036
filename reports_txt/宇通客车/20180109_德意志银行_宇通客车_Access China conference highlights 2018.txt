Yutong Bus attended our Access China Conference on 8 January. The following
Research Analyst
are the key takeaways from investor meetings:
Yutong sold 67,568 units of buses in 2017 (-5% YoY), including c.25k units of
Vincent Ha, CFA
new energy (NEV) buses. Among the total NEV bus sales volume, c.90% was

public buses. According to Yutong, it recorded over 10% YoY NEV bus volume
growth in 4Q17. However, pricing has been trending lower in 4Q17.
Yuki Lu
Research Associate
Management expects the company to achieve a 27-28% market share in NEV
bus market in 2017 (33% in total bus market including conventional buses), a
slight YoY increase with industry NEV bus sales declining more than 10% YoY.
Price/price relative
For 2018E, the company believes it will continue to outgrow the overall market
and remains positive on NEV bus sales in 1Q18 given the delay of the subsidy cut.
The company will strive to maintain the relatively stable profitability of its NEV
buses and expects to partially mitigate the negative impact from the reduced NEV
bus subsidy through raising net-subsidy selling price and supplier cost reduction

(i.e. battery cost).
- Management comments that about 60% of the public transportation bus sold
in 2017 were NEV buses. Despite the cuts in NEV bus subsidy in 2018-20, the
company believes that the public transportation field would still be government's

Deutsche Bank view - maintain Buy on increasing contribution from NEV bus
Despite the impact on margin due to possibly lower subsidies in 2018, we believe
that major NEV makers such as Yutong can probably mitigate this in the long run
by lowering production costs (e.g. battery and scale effects). Maintain Buy given
our optimism on Yutong's increasing profit contribution from NEV bus segment.
Our target price is based on 14x FY18E P/E (unchanged), c.30% above Yutong's

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited – up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors,
including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets and changes in
interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an
underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
