1H18 earnings hurt by subsidy cuts
Valuation & Risks
Vincent Ha, CFA
3.5ppt YoY gross profit margin erosion leading to 23% YoY earnings drop
Research Analyst
Yutong announced on 27 August that its 1H18 net profit dropped 23.4% YoY to
RMB616.5m. As this accounts for only 16% of our previous FY18 estimates, we
consider the results a miss. 1H18 gross revenue grew 29.0% YoY to RMB12.0bn

bus mix. Yet with the effect of new energy vehicle (NEV) subsidy cut, Yutong's
1H18 gross profit margin contracted 3.5ppts YoY to 20.9%. In addition, SG&A
also grew at a faster pace than topline growth. As a result, SG&A expense ratio
climbed to 16.1% (vs. 14.9% in 1H17).
The company hosted a conference call today. Key takeaways are as follows:
Profit decline: management attributed the profit decline to the rise in R&D
expense and changes in the NEV subsidy policy. To elaborate, the 30%
YoY subsidy cut was applied during the transition period (between 12)
February 2018 to 11 June 2018). Post 11 June, a 40% YoY cut was applied,

units, with sales volume of new energy bus up 195.7% to 8,765 units and
traditional bus down 15.0% YoY to 16,015 units. In terms of breakdown
by region, the domestic market rose 24.3% YoY to 21,721 units, whilst
overseas markets were under pressure, down 29.8% YoY to 3,059 units.
Cost cutting: Despite the challenging margin profile in 1H18, the company
expects gross profit margin to gradually recover on the back of: 1)
improved pricing of new products; 2) better cost control as purchase
costs of battery/electric motor/electronic control unit have declined; and
increased sales volume, which would lead to lower unit fixed costs.
Guidance: The company maintains its FY18 target – sales volumes returns
to 2016 levels; revenue to reach c.RMB34bn; net profit to maintain at the
2017 level.
Deutsche Bank view – still a well positioned new energy bus manufacturer
On the back of the strong 1H18 topline growth and thus higher ASP assumptions,
we raise our FY18-20 revenue forecast by 6.3-6.6% on higher ASP assumptions.

and mitigate subsidy cut pressure, as well as higher SG&A expense estimate on
higher R&D, we cut our FY18-20 forecast by 14.3-14.9%.
We still like Yutong's established market position in the bus segment, including
the new energy bus segment, and believe its earnings outlook should improve
with long-term receding of subsidy cut impacts. Our target price is based on 15.0x
FY18/19E P/E (from 15.0x FY18E), about 35% more than Yutong's mid-cycle P/
E of 11x to reflect our optimism on Yutong's increased profit contribution from
the new energy bus segment. This is justifiable, in our view, as we expect the
company to deliver a 11% three-year earnings CAGR in FY17-20E. Key downside
risks for Yutong include: 1) unexpected changes in the Chinese government's new
energy bus subsidy policy; 2) weaker-than-expected new energy bus demand;
and 3) market share loss in new energy buses.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the
currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
