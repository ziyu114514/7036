Soft bus sales continue in November
Event
Yutong reported November bus wholesale shipment data after the market
close on 4 December.
Impact
Soft November sales: Yutong shipped 5,784 buses in November, down 25%
units in 11M18. The weakness was mainly due to a continued decline in the
demand for conventional buses, especially in the non-urban transit segment.
Investment fundamentals
Yutong sold ~3,000 new energy buses (E-buses) in November, down from
4.663 units in November 2017.
What is behind our Neutral rating: 1) assuming 40% and 20% subsidy cuts
for E-buses in 2019-20E. The reported subsidy policy (LINK) indicates that
there could be an upside with subsidies in 2019; 2) expecting continued
weakness in bus demand in 2019, especially in conventional bus space and
overseas markets; 3) elevated impairment losses as well as R&D costs during
product and technology transition. We would turn more positive on better-than-
expected bus demand, lower-than-expected subsidy cut and higher-than-
expected battery procurement cost cut.
Action and recommendation
We maintain our Neutral rating.
