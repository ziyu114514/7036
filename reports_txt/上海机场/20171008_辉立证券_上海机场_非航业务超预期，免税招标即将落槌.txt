航空業務收入受准點率考核影響，同比增長 3.5%
2017 年上半年，受益於相對低油價和宏觀經濟緩慢復蘇，中國航空業穩中有進，航空
流量保持良好的增長勢頭，市場需求旺盛，航空客運市場保持快速增長。2017 年上半
年全行業的運輸總周轉量、旅客運輸量、貨郵運輸量分別按年增長 12.5%、13.4%、
5.1%。全國機場錄得的飛機起降架次、旅客吞叶量、貨郵吞叶量亦相應按年增長

受到准點率考核未達標影響，公司的飛機起降架次、旅客吞吐量增幅小於行業平均，
拖累上半年航空性業務收入僅同比增長 3.5%至 18.03 億元。同時，從結構上看，國內
航線的旅客吞叶量增幅(+11%)遠高於國際航線(+3%),而國際航線的貨運吞叶量
增幅表現亮眼（+18%）。
非航業務超預期,大增 26%
業績超預期的主要原因來自于高增長的非航業務。上半年公司實現非航收入
20.94 億元，同比大幅增長 26%，占總收入比重擴大 5 個百分點至 54%，首次超
過航空業務收入。其中商業租賃收入大幅提升 35.99%至 14.36 億元，主要受益
於 T1 航站樓改造完成後商業面積擴大;其他非航業務提升 9.68%至 6.58 億元。
免稅招標即將落槌，樞紐機場價值穩固
公司的機場免稅業務合同將於 2018 年 3 月到期,管理層表示正在進行新一輪招
標計劃,我們預計年底前有望啓動。預計新的提成比例由原來的 25%左右上漲
至 45%,大幅增厚業績。
2017 年上半年,上海機場的年旅客吞吐量鞏固了全國第二的排名,其中國際和
地區的旅客量繼續保持全國第一。公司仍在繼續推進以上海爲中心的長三角經
濟帶空中樞紐的建設，持續優化航線網絡結構，重點發展國際遠程航線，上半
年上海機場新增國際通航點 2 個,加密遠程航線 2 條,並且新增 3 家國外航空
個,其中國內和國際(包括地區)分別為 109 個和 125 個,彰顯樞紐機場地位
穩固。未來 2025 年三期擴建工程完成後，旅客吞吐量將超 8000 萬人次，再加
上由“單航站樓雙跑道”向“多航站樓多跑道”運營模式的跨越,預計公司將
開啟新一輪的穩健成長之路。
