3Q17 a small miss with higher selling
cost and flat JVs' earnings growth
Valuation & Risks
Vincent Ha, CFA
8% 3Q16 net profit YoY growth on decent sales at both local brands and JVs
Research Analyst
SAIC Motor released 3Q17 results after the market close on 30 October. The
company's 3Q17 gross revenue grew 17.4% YoY to RMB211.6bn, on the back
of 11.3% growth in vehicle sales volume during the period, probably due to
Fei Sun, CFA
product mix improvement. Meanwhile, SAIC Motor's 3Q17 gross profit rose
Research Analyst
26.1% YoY to RMB29.7bn with 1.0ppt YoY gross profit margin improvement,
possibly also due to better sales mix. Yet with a 46.7% higher selling expense
YoY and flat profit contribution from its JVs (despite 9.7% and 7.7% YoY sales
Yuki Lu
volume growth at SAIC Volkswagen and SAIC GM, respectively), 3Q17 net profit
Research Associate
increased only 8.1% YoY to RMB8.7bn. On a 9M17 basis, SAIC Motor's net profit
of RMB24.6bn was up 6.7% YoY, accounting for 70% of DB's FY17 forecast
and 68% of Bloomberg's full-year FY17 forecast. We consider the results slightly
below expectations as nine months' net profit accounted for 71-72% of full-year
net profits in the past two years.
Deutsche Bank view – stable earnings growth and attractive yield in the price
Going forward, we expect SAIC Motor's 4Q17 sales momentum to be sustained
with year-end sales rush and further product mix improvement. However, we
think that extra promotional efforts will be needed to push sales amid intensifying
competition. All in all, we envision a stable earnings growth trajectory for the
Price/price relative
company, which should support its generous dividend payout. We maintain Hold
on SAIC Motor because we think the current valuation is fair.
We raise our FY17-19 revenue forecasts marginally, by 3.7-5.2%, on higher sales
volume estimates, but trim our FY17-19 net profit forecasts 0.3-2.1% mainly
on lower consolidated EBIT margin assumptions. We value SAIC Motor at 9.5x
FY18E P/E (from 9x FY18E given recent auto rector re-rating), which is above the
company's historical trading average and close to the industry's long-term P/E
average. This is justified, in our view, as we expect SAIC Motor to achieve a three-
year net profit CAGR of 7% in FY16-19. On a P/BV basis, we believe the company's
implied FY18E target P/BV of 1.5x is justified, considering its 16-17% sustainable
ROE.
Key downside risks include: 1) a weak reception for its new models from various
SAIC brands; 2) pricing pressure amid industry competition; and 3) worse-
than-expected local brand profitability. Key upside risks include: 1) better-than-
expected sales volume and pricing; and 2) better-than-expected local brand
profitability.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to
specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
