Al-related transceivers have offset non-Al transceivers. Company's
2Q23 revenue showed sequential growth (17.9% QoQ) primarily attributed
Kevin ZHANG
to heightened shipment of 800G transceivers. However, total revenue fell
slightly in 1H23, as the Company pointed out that the demand for
200G/400G transceivers from datacenter was declining. This trend aligns
with our previous expectations that Al investment will likely
cannibalize certain traditional server expenditures and negatively affect
sales of non-Al high speed transceivers. (link)

■ Margins stand out particularly. GPM expanded to 31.1% in 2Q23 vs.
29.5%/29.3% in 1Q23/2022. NPM also increased to 16.8% in 2Q23 vs.

Share Performance
Maintain HOLD, with unchanged TP at RMB104. We lowered 2023-25E
revenue forecasts by 6%-11%, as non-Al weakness is greater than our
previous expectations. 2023-25E GPM was adjusted to 30.5%-31.7%,
reflecting favourable product mix as the Company is expected to deliver

from lower sales and higher GPM left NP almost unchanged. 1H23 total
revenue/NP now accounted for 39%/42% of our full-year estimates.
Potential upside/downside: We believe investors are closely monitoring
the scaling up of 800G transceiver capacity and the Company's ability to
sustain the current performance, i.e., sequential sales growth and
continuing margin expansion. Meanwhile, the deteriorated demand of
200G/400G transceivers for datacenter should be on investors' radar. While

we regard Innolight's optical transceivers business positively, we believe the
current valuation is full.
