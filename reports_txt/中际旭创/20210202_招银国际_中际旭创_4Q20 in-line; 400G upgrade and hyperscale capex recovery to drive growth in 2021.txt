preliminary net profit of RMB780-905mn (+52%-76% YoY), largely in-line
Stock Data
with our/consensus estimates, mainly driven by global hyperscale capex
from major cloud companies (e.g. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft)
and rapid 400G upgrade. For 4Q20, we estimate revenue/net profit grew
25%/62% YoY (vs +57%/56% YoY in 3Q20), given slower China 5G
deployment but improving margins due to better product mix and yield of
400G products.
Shareholding Structure
Expect strong demand pick-up in 2Q/3Q21E. Looking into FY21E, we
expect weaker 1Q21E on seasonality and sequential demand pick-up into
2Q/3Q21E, driven by datacom demand ramp from overseas clients. As the
global largest supplier of 100G/200G/400G optical modules and increasing
Share Performance
presence in telecom market, we expect Innolight to become the major
beneficiary of secular data growth and 400G datacom upgrade cycle. We
expect Innolight to deliver 29%/37% revenue/NP CAGR during FY20-22E.
Maintain BUY with new TP of RMB72.66. We reiterate BUY and adjusted

revision of our forecasts. Trading at 29.7x FY21E P/E (1-sd below 2-year
avg.), we think the stock is attractive, compared to 39% EPS FY20-22E
CAGR. Potential risks include weaker capex from global cloud companies,
slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and higher ASP pressure.

Valuation
Maintain BUY with new TP RMB72.66 (41.5% upside)
We derived our new 12m TP of RMB72.66 based on same 41.9x FY20E P/E, in line with
its 2-year historical average. We believe this is justified as Innolight is the industry leader
in the fast growing optical module market. Upcoming catalysts include increasing demand
of 200G/400G/800G and share gain in China telecom market. Potential risks include
weaker capex from cloud giants, slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and ASP pressure.
