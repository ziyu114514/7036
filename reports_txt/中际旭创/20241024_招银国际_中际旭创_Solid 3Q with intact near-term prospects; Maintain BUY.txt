trajectory, driven by the ramp-up in 400G/800G shipments and the upcoming

The company highlighted that 3Q performance was negatively impacted by
unfavourable USD/RMB exchange rate fluctuations. Excluding this impact
(~RMB100mn), the company still posted double-digit sequential growth,
continuing the strong growth momentum seen in previous guarters.
Additionally, supply chain challenges related to key components constrained

Price increases in the optical supply chain driven by Al demand: The
recent announcement (link) by Marvell (MRVL US, NR) of price hikes across
its entire product line due to sustained Al-driven demand could lead to higher
raw material costs for Innolight. However, we believe the company is well-
positioned to mitigate these impacts by passing on price increases to its
customers, given the strong demand for its products that gives company the

currently trading at 22.5x 2025E P/E. Risks: 1) China-US trade tensions, 2)
rising raw material costs, and 3) weaker-than-expected ramp-up speed.
