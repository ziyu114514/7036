RMB2.1bn/RMB217mn. We think the results are solid and largely in-line with our
expectations. We maintain our positive outlook on overseas Cloud demand and
Lily Yang, Ph.D
believe Innolight will continue to gain share in the optical transceiver market.
Reiterate BUY, with unchanged TP of RMB45.6.
Innolight's solid 4Q21/1Q22 results are largely within our expectations.
Alex Ng
FY21 revenue was 1% lower than our previous estimate and net profit to
shareholders was 3% higher than our estimate. 1Q22 revenue/NP
sales will deliver steady QoQ growth, following a similar trend as in 2021.
Lana Lin
GPM improved to 28.1% in 4Q21 from 24.5% in Q3, mainly due to favorable
product mix as hyperscale CSPs are ramping up the deployments for
200G/400G optical modules. However, GPM in 1Q22 dropped to 26.3% as
a result of continuing component shortage and increasing costs affected by

domestic partial lockdown.
Outlook remains positive given the demand from overseas Cloud
companies stays strong. In our previous report (Link), we pointed out that
Amazon, Meta and Microsoft all posted record Capex, and guided very
positive budgets for this year to support their cloud services and Al-related
Shareholding Structure
businesses. We maintain our positive outlook for Innolight. According to
Omdia, Innolight had taken up 12% market share in the optical transceiver
market (ranked No. 2). The Company has gained the most share among the
top 10 players, mainly driven by the increasing sales of its 200G and 400G
optical module products.
Share Performance
Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB45.6. We maintain BUY and
keep our target price at RMB45.6. Potential risks include weaker capex from
global cloud companies, slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and worse-
than-expected component shortage.
