to grow 32.03-55.51% YoY to RMB450mn-RMB530mn. 1H22 NP excluding
extraordinary items is expected to grow 29.85-55.82% YoY. Mid-point NP of
China Technology Sector
RMB490mn is estimated to account for 44.2% of FY22 NP, in line with our
previous forecast. The mgmt. attributed the growth to surging data demand (for

■ 1H22 results in line with our previous forecasts. Mid-point 2Q NP to
shareholders is expected to grow 31.2% YoY and 25.4% QoQ. The Company

impact from FX changes. We think 2Q results are in line with our previous
forecasts. This positive profit alert confirmed our view that optical transceiver
industry is one of a few sectors that managed to maintain their steady growth.
Datacenter demand to remain resilient in 2H22 despite concerns over
demand and spending cut. As earning season is coming, the market is
looking for more clarity over demand/supply. We expect mobile and PC
demand to remain weak, and the supply chain will continue to face challenges
from inventory adjustment. However, we believe data center and auto markets

will continue to outperform due to resilient demand. Although there are signs

Reiterate BUY with unchanged TP of RMB45.60. Innolight is a major
beneficiary of cloud capex growth. Product mix will continue to improve as
clients will deploy 800G optical modules starting from year end or early 2023.
Maintain BUY. TP of RMB45.60 is equivalent to 26x 23E P/E, close to
historical 2-year average (25x).
Potential risks include weaker capex from global cloud companies, slower
deployment of 5G infrastructure and faster-than-expected tech advancement.
