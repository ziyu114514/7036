14.9%/89.5% YoY and 39.7%/88.4% QoQ, respectively. The strong revenue growth

three quarters of 2023, climbing from 29.5%/31.1% in 1Q/2Q to 33.5% in 3Q. The

True Al beneficiaries apart from Nvidia start riding the tailwind. We have
noticed discrepancies in 3Q performances of several optical transceiver peers.
This underscores Innolight's position as a market leader and further solidifies its
status as a true beneficiary of the ongoing Al momentum, a point we previously
highlighted in our report (link). We believe these true beneficiaries in Al value

chain will gradually deliver a positive outcome in 2023/24E.
12-mth Price Performance
Maintain BUY with unchanged TP of RMB109.30. Looking ahead, we expect the
Company to maintain its robust performance, driven by the production ramp-up of
800G optical transceivers and better-than-expected demand for 400G products.
We will continue to monitor Innolight's clients' comments on their capex outlook as
the overseas hyperscalers are expected to announce earnings results soon.
Upside catalysts: 1) faster-than-expected ramp-up of 800G, and 2) slower-than-
expected decline of non-Al revenue. Downside risks: 1) continuous rise in interest

rates, 2) intensified geopolitical tensions, and 3) lower-than-expected production.
