PM Summary: Waiting for the light
Company Overview
Founded and headquartered in Suzhou in 2008, Innolight researches, designs, builds
and markets high-speed optical transceiver modules - devices that enable the
transmission of data via optical fiber cable. With c.5% global market share as of 2017,
Innolight is already a top supplier to cloud providers like Google, Amazon, Alibaba and
Tencent and will be one of the first to provide next generation 400G products in 2019. At
the same time, it is set to supply to the 5G mobile communications market with its
products already qualified by Huawei and ZTE.
Scenario Analysis
With US exports accounting for c.60% of current total revenue, and all of its
manufacturing facilities in China, we believe potential US tariffs would have a material
impact on earnings. While we don't incorporate any tariffs into our estimates, based on
our scenario analysis that includes stress-testing Innolight s top suppliers, we see:
a 10% tariff to reduce EPS by 12%/16%/2%(18E/19E/20E);
a 25% tariff to reduce EPS by 18%/30%/12%(18E/19E/20E).

Industry
The optical transceiver module market can be divided into two main sectors, Telecom
and Datacom (i.e. datacenters/cloud). The Telecom market can be further divided into
fixed-line network, transport network and access network (FTTH) and wireless network
(e.g., 4G, 5G).
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
Datacom: We forecast that the optical transceiver module market size of the global
Datacom sector growing at 20% CAGR between 2018 and 2022, reaching $5.8 billion.
The main drivers of the growth are (1) increasing demand for data center services, (2)
continued penetration of fiber used in new-built data centers and (3) optical transceiver
data rate upgrade in the newly built data centers.
Telecom: According to our estimate, Innolight's addressable Telecom market will grow
at a 39% CAGR from 2018 to 2022, arriving at $1.7 billion. (1) We forecast that the
global 5G base station will reach around 12 million units in 2027 (the end of the 5G
cycle), double the number of the total 4G base stations due to shorter coverage area. (2)
25G and 100G optical transceiver modules will be the mainstream choice for the 5G
fronthaul transmission network vs. 10G modules for 4G network.
Financials
We believe Innolight's 100G and 400G transceiver modules will be the key growth
avenue for the company. With the constantly growing demand for data from end users,
both Datacom and Telecom players are upgrading their current network with higher data
rate transceiver modules. Going forward, 100G and 400G transceiver modules will be
the mainstream choice in our view for the data center access/core layer networks and
5G fronthaul/backhaul networks.
Innolight also has superior ROE than the majority of its global peers, below industry
average cash conversion cycle, with low and stable financial leverage. We see healthy
and growing free cash flow over the next three years.
Valuation
Given uncertainty around tariffs, we apply Innolight's trough multiple of 20X to 2019E
EPS of Rmb2.29 to arrive at 12-month target price of Rmb46, implying 9% upside and
therefore we initiate at Neutral. We also explore different scenarios with the potential
tariff, and different multiples (detailed further inside), and a probability weighted
theoretical value. Scenarios:
No tariff: Rmb69 (based on 30X P/E on 2019E EPS of Rmb2.29), 64% upside
10% tariff: Rmb48 (based on 25X P/E on 2019E EPS of Rmb1.93), 14% upside
25% tariff: Rmb32 (based on 20X P/E on 2019E EPS of Rmb1.61), 24% downside
Our US macro team assigns a 70% chance of tariff implementation, with 25% on
non-consumer products, and an eventual "deal" to be reached in 12 months' time.
Based on this, for one scenario we apply a 70% probability to a 25% tariff scenario (20X
P/E) + a 30% probability to no tariff scenario (30X P/E), to derive an implied value of
Rmb43.
Key risks
Stronger or weaker demand from cloud and 5G capex
Uncertainties around tariff implementation
3. Competition from Silicon Photonics

Company Overview: Leading optical module maker benefiting from
cloud and 5G demand
A leading player in the global optical transceiver module industry
Founded and headquartered in Suzhou in 2008, Innolight researches, designs, builds
and markets high-speed optical transceiver modules - devices that enable the
transmission of data via optical fiber cable - used in a range of applications, including
cloud computing/data centers, long distance transmission and wireless access. The
transceiver modules work by converting a server's electrical signals into optical
signals, then transporting those optical signals by fiber-optic cables to a different server,
and then converting them back into electrical signals.
Innolight is a pure-play optical transceiver module manufacturer and its key investors
include CapitalG, the venture-capital fund of Google's parent Alphabet Inc, and was
acquired in July 2017 by Zhongji Equipment, an A-share listed electrical equipment
manufacturer based in Shandong Province. After the acquisition, Innolight accounted for
96.57% of the combined company's 2H17 revenue.

What is an optical transceiver module in layman's terms?
Optical transceiver modules are devices that enable the transmission of data via optical fiber cables by converting
electrical signals from servers into optical signals, and vice versa.
Optical transceiver modules are applied in many scenarios - from cloud operators like Amazon to communications equipment
manufacturers - and can operate at different transmission speeds and distances. The device is made up of a transmitter and receiver
with one side of the module plugged into the server/switch, and the other side is connected to an optical fiber cable, thus achieving the
conversion and transmission of data traffic. Simply put, whenever this is an optical fiber, an optical transceiver is needed at each end to
"activate" the network.

The increase in data traffic from around the world, especially with the growing
penetration of cloud services and as the next generation of wireless networks looms, is
boosting demand for optical fiber connections which can transmit data at a higher speed
and between longer distances as compared to copper cables.
Innolight's R&D strength is demonstrated in the company's leading market position in
100G/400G transceivers. Innolight was among the first to develop products for the 100G
market in the industry and its products were widely used among global tier one Datacom
players. Currently, Innolight is the No.1 100G transceiver supplier for Google, Amazon,
Alibaba, Tencent, and Huawei, and No.2 for Facebook, according to Innolight
management.

Innolight is also among the first to demonstrate the next generation 400G OSFP and
QSFP-DD product in 2017, and has already started shipping these in small volumes to
Google and Amazon in 2018. The company expects volume shipment in 2019.

Scenario Analysis: Potential US tariff impact and stress-testing the
supply chain
With US exports accounting for around 60% of Innolight's current total revenue, and all
of its manufacturing facilities located in China, we believe potential tariffs on US imports
from China as proposed by the White House would have a material impact on earnings if
enacted, as optical transceiver modules are subject to the proposed tariff. Therefore we
conduct a scenario analysis and stress-testing on Innolight's top suppliers to better
understand the potential change in estimates should the White House move forward with
tariffs, although note we do not incorporate any tariffs into our actual estimates given
tariffs have not been implemented.
1. We conduct one scenario assuming tariffs are 25%, in line with our US macro team
which assigns a 70% chance of tariff implementation, with 25% on non-consumer
products, and an eventual "deal" to be reached in 12 months' time.
2. We also conduct a scenario assuming tariffs are 10% given this was the original
proposed tariff before the White House lifted the proposal to 25%.
2018年9月13日
Scenario 1: 10% tariff
We estimate 2%/4%/2% lower revenue and 12%/16%/2% lower net income in
2018E/2019E/2020E.
of these suppliers can sustain a 5%-10% price cut. See our analysis below.
Assumptions:
□ Revenue
1. Assuming 70\%/60\%/50\% of revenue is from overseas in 2018E/19E/20E
2. For data center demand of US customers outside of US, Innolight can ship
directly to the end market
3. According to Jones Lang LaSalle, 34% of overseas data center capacity
under construction now is from US
4. We assume for overseas demand outside US, Innolight can directly ship
0%/50%/100% to end market
□ COGS
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
1. Among COGS, 65% of the value is for optical and electrical chips, which are
hard to find alternative suppliers
2. We assume for the other non-critical components, Innolight can transfer half
of its tariff to its suppliers
3. We analyzed Innolight's top 5 suppliers in 2014-2016, and estimate 3 out
of 5 are able to sustain a 5%-10% price cut.
Scenario 2: 25% tariff
In this case because it would be more severe, we believe Innolight would need to
use a non-China OEM to manufacture their US shipments to avoid the tariffs, similar
to some of its global peers.
Revenue therefore won't be impacted, but net income will be 18%/30%/12% lower
in 2018E/2019E/2020E due to the costs of outsourcing.
Assumptions:
□ Revenue
Revenue will be unchanged since Innolight would use a non-China OEM to
manufacture their US shipments
COGS
1. Innolight's US demand are mostly 100G modules with c.28% gross
margin currently
2. Assume OEM produced gross margin will be 5% lower (i.e. 23%), and OEM
will add a 10% cost margin
3. Gross margin for 100G modules will be lowered to 15% when outsourced
Stress-testing Innolight's top suppliers
suppliers over 2014-2016 (supplier names for 2017 not disclosed by Innolight) to
estimate if Innolight could theoretically pass on some of the tariff pressure to its
suppliers, namely Avago (now known as Broadcom, covered by Toshiya Hari),
Mitsubishi Electric (covered by Ikuo Matsuhashi), Suzhou Agix (838112.OC, traded
on China OTC market, Not Covered), LuxNet (4979.TW, Not Covered), and Macom
(covered by Mark Delaney). Using this historical data, we believe 3 out of 5 of these
suppliers in theory could sustain a 5%-10% price cut based on our sensitivity
analysis below meaning Innolight could past on tariff pressure to those in our view.
By using simple maths and historical data and holding everything else steady, we
estimate Avago/Agix/Macom could still have a historical 40%-60% gross margin and
a 15%-35% net margin, even after a 5% price cut, and those margins would still be
relatively high compared to historical trough levels. Mitsubishi/LuxNet on the other
hand have relatively thin/negative margins, and thus would probably be less likely to
be able to take price cuts.

Competitive Advantages: Strong R&D, superior packaging
technology, and fast product refresh cycle
#1: Superior R&D strength
Stable management team with rich experience in R&D
The global optical transceiver module industry has experienced accelerated product
iteration in recent years due to increasing demand for data from end users. The
trend requires R&D personnel to be both experienced and commercially agile in
order to capture the growth opportunities.
Innolight stop management team has extensive experience in the global optical
communication industry and has been with the company for around 10 years. All
members in the company's R&D leadership team are US-educated PhDs and have
held significant R&D related positions in established industry giants like Pine
Photonics, Opnext, Oplink, Intel and Agere Systems (former Alcatel Lucent). By the
end of 2017, Innolight had built a full-spectrum 400-person R&D team with
specialized expertise in optical, electronic, mechanical, software, testing and
manufacturing procedures.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
Strong commitment in R&D
Innolight has three Research Centers located in mainland China, Taiwan and the
US, enabling it to attract a global talent pool in the industry. At the end of 2017, the
company has 397 dedicated R&D personnel and 366 employees have a Bachelor or
above degree. Innolight's R&D spending accounted for ~ 8% of their total sales in
2017, which translates into around Rmb 375,000 per person. Innolight also partners
with its clients to design products that are tailored to their specific needs. For
example, Innolight partnered with Google to develop its 100G product, which was
later deployed in Google's new data centers.
Innolight has historically invested heavily in R&D. According to management,
Innolight spent 20% - 30% of their total sales in R&D when the company first started.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
It allowed the company to quickly ramp up their product portfolio. From 2012 to
2017, the company's R&D spending grew at 71% CAGR thanks to its fast topline
growth, reaching Rmb 277 mn in 2017. Innolight had an R&D/sales ratio of 7% in
2017, trailing that of its global peers thanks to lower personnel costs in Mainland
China. Innolight's R&D/sales ratio was in line with its domestic peers in 2017, but
was ahead most of them in terms of absolute values (only Accelink spent more in
R&D than Innolight among domestic firms, as Accelink is vertically integrated.).
Industry-leading packaging technologies
According to the management, Innolight is the first in the industry to introduce
non-hermetic packaging technology (COB) in data center optical transceiver
modules. Compared with hermetic packaging, non-hermetic packaging enables cost
reduction, lower production precision requirement and less physical space, which is
ideal for data center applications.
Another core technology of the company is its single mode parallel optical design
and specifically its free space coupling technology. According to a patent filed in
China by the company, Innolight has developed a technology that enables it to
increase its coupling error tolerance from <0.2um to around 1um, significantly
improving the company's coupling efficiency and production yield. These
leading-edge solutions require expertise and intellectual property across numerous
disciplines including active and passive optical device design, systems-level analog
and mixed-signal integrated circuit design, and optical device integration and
packaging, much of which is developed over time and cannot be easily replicated.

图表 17: COB packaging
图表 18: Best-in-class free-space coupling technology
What is COB packaging:
A bare chip that is mounted directly onto the
printed circuit board (PCB) instead of being
socketed to it
Advantages of COB packaging:
Enable fully automated production process
Increase production precision
Reduce packaging cost
Require little physical space
Key sub components:
1) Laser; 2) No.1 lens; 3) No.1 lens connected ring;
No.2 lens; 5) No.2 lens connected ring;
6) Hollow shaft slip ring; 7) Substrate
How it works:
Traditional single mode laser coupling uses
a single lens to conduct active coupling.
However, this method requires high
production precision (<0.2um coupling error)
Innolight uses two coaxial lenses to enlarge
the light spot, enabling high coupling
efficiency even the coupling error is relatively
high (~1um)
Benefits:
Improve production yield and productivity
#2: Fast decision making and product refresh cycle
Concentrated R&D focus on packaging technology
Most of Innolight's global competitors are vertically integrated players, who cover
all segments in the value chain, from chip design to module packaging. Chip design
and scale production is very capital intensive and time consuming. Plus, there are
many different types of optical chips, so it is very difficult for one company to be the
best at everything. In comparison, Innolight focuses only on the transceiver module
packaging technology and chooses to work with industry leading suppliers for their
electrical/optical chips and other components. By doing so, we believe Innolight is
able to better leverage its own expertise in packaging technologies and maintain the
flexibility in choosing a supplier that enables the quickest product launch.
Industry-leading manufacturing facilities and experienced production personnel
Innolight's NPI (New Product Introduction) team has c.10 years of new product
launch experiences and the manufacturing management team has on average more
2018年9月13日
than 8 years of experience and over 5 years' experience in the optical
communication industry. The experienced production team enables smooth
production management and efficiency. Innolight has also invested heavily in
automated production and testing lines. Currently, Innolight has 16 production lines
and 160 fully automated testing systems. Combining its main R&D and
manufacturing facilities at a single location with company headquarters facilitates
active cooperation between departments and also helps the company to respond
quickly to market changes.
Strategic relationship with upstream chip makers and sub-module suppliers
To ensure a stable supply of key components, Innolight has built multiple strategic
partnerships with major upstream chip and sub-module suppliers in various locations
including North America, Japan and mainland China. In addition, Innolight has a
joint-design-manufacture collaboration with Google for 100G data center optical
transceiver modules. As part of the collaboration, Google purchases customized
chips from a third party supplier and sells the chips to Innolight. The collaboration will
also help to stabilize chip supply as Google has an aligned interest with Innolight
and much higher bargaining power in the industry.
Trust building with key customers
Innolight has overseas branches and distribution partners in multiple worldwide
locations including US, EU, Japan, South Korea, Russia and Israel. The local
presence helps Innolight to better understand its customer needs and thus allows
the company to offer tailored products. Currently, Innolight is the largest 100G
transceiver module supplier to Google, Amazon, Alibaba, Huawei and Tencent and
is among the top suppliers for Facebook. Its telecom products have already been
tested and certified by Huawei and ZTE, enabling Innolight to tap into the 5G mobile
technology market once the construction cycle starts.
#3: Best-in-class operational efficiency
Lower R&D and SG&A costs vs. overseas peers
Compared to most of its overseas competitors, Innolight has a much lower SG&A
2017, Innolight's R&D cost ratio and
its SG&A (ex. R&D) cost ratio is cc. 8% and cc. 5% lower than its overseas peers.
This is largely attributable to much lower personnel cost in China vs. US. Based on
our channel checks, a senior engineer level hire for major competitor Finisar will cost
around Rmb 850,000 per annum based in the US, while it will only cost around Rmb
500,000 for Innolight.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
Higher gross profit margin vs. domestic peers
Unlike most of its domestic peers, Innolight's product portfolio is relatively
high-end, with 40G/100G optical transceiver module products accounting for 89% of
the company's total 2H2017 sales (vs. 15% for Accelink). The low-end optical
transceiver module market is highly competitive with both global and domestic
players. Therefore, the pricing pressure on the low end is relatively high, putting
pressure on the GP margin. Due to technology barriers, most of Innolight's
domestic peers do not have the mass production capability for 100G transceiver
modules with a high yield rate as Innolight does, enabling Innolight to achieve a
higher gross profit margin as competition in the high-end module market is less
intense. As Innolight's SG&A level is in line with its domestic peers, its net profit
margin, outperforms most of its peers.

Industry: Dual capex engines from cloud and 5G driving industry
growth
The optical transceiver module market can be divided into two main sectors, Telecom
and Datacom (i.e. datacenters/cloud). The Telecom market can be further divided into
fixed-line network, transport network and access network (FTTH) and wireless network
(e.g., 4G, 5G).
2018年9月13日

Datacom sector
We forecast that the optical transceiver module market size of the global Datacom
sector to grow at 20% CAGR between 2018 and 2022, reaching $5.8 billion. The main
drivers of the growth are (1) increasing demand for data center services, (2) continued
penetration of fiber used in new-built data centers and (3) optical transceiver data rate
upgrade in the newly built data centers.
(1) According to the Cisco Global Cloud Index, the global data center traffic will reach
20.6 Zettabytes by 2021, representing a 25% CAGR from 2016 to 2021. The trend is
mainly driven by new applications such as 4K/8K streaming, AR/VR and autonomous
driving, which have high bandwidth requirements. The increase of data traffic triggers a
higher demand for optical fiber connections which can transmit data at a higher speed
and between longer distances as compared to copper cables.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
(2) In 2016, around 90% of the DCs in China used the traditional three-layer structure,
which hardly requires fiber connections at the access layer (between servers and
top-of-rack switches). However, starting in 2013, with the advent of the two-layer
spin-and-leaf architecture data centers, which is designed to accommodate the
increasing 'west to east' (between-server) traffic within data centers, will start to use
all-fiber connections in the access layers, significantly boosting data center optical
transceiver usage (4 vs. 0 per server). To cope with the increasing demand, data center
service providers like Google, Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Microsoft, and Alibaba are
also steadily increasing their investment in hyperscale data centers. According to Cisco,
the number of global hyperscale data centers will increase from 338 in 2016 to 628 in
(3) Lastly, we noticed that in new generation data centers, 10G/25G/40G transceivers
are replacing 1.25G transceivers that were used between servers and switches, and
40G/100G transceivers are becoming the mainstream choice for switch-to-switch
connections. In the future, data centers are planning to adopt 400G and even higher
data rate optical transceivers, driving the ASP growth.

Telecom sector
Telecom market can be further divided into fixed-line network, transport network, access
network (FTTH) and wireless network (e.g., 4G, 5G). Given that Innolight does not and
is not expected to have exposure to the first three subsectors, we only include the
wireless network market in our framework.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
According to our estimate, Innolight's addressable telecom market will grow at a 39%
CAGR from 2018 to 2022, arriving at $1.7 billion. The growth is mainly driven by the
rollout of global 5G network, which is expected by telcos to be available for commercial
million units in 2027 (the end of the 5G cycle), double the number of the total 4G base
stations due to shorter coverage area. This will significantly push up the volume demand
for optical transceiver modules, as it is a key component for the 5G optical network.
In the 5G era, data transmission speed will be greatly increased. According to China
Mobile, 5G data transmission speed will reach 1.5Gbps, 10X that of 4G. The data rate
increase is achieved by using higher speed transceiver modules. 25G and 100G optical
transceiver modules will be the mainstream choice for the 5G fronthaul transmission
network vs. 10G modules for 4G network, while 100G, 200G, and 400G will be widely
used in the midhaul and backhaul transmission network.

track record of launching new products early in the product's life cycle. In the
recent 400G product cycle, Innolight launched its 400G offering at the same time as
its integrated global peers and 6 months earlier than its domestic peers. The
first-to-market strategy enables the company to continuously gain market share in a
less competitive market in early cycle of a new product. According to the
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
management, Innolight has a 20% to 30% market share in the global Datacom
transceiver module market. Especially in the mainstream 100G market, the company
is the top 100G supplier to top-tier cloud service providers like Google, Amazon,
Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, and is among the top suppliers to Facebook (expects to
become No.2 supplier in 2H18). The leading position of Innolight in the Datacom
market positions it well to capture the next round of data center upgrade from 100G
to 400G transceiver modules.
Telecom
Innolight's strong revenue growth also benefited from the telecom 3G and 4G
construction cycles in China. According to the company, its 6G LTE SFP+ optical
transceiver module was adopted by China Mobile in their 3G network rollout, while
its 10G products were also widely deployed in the 4G network construction in China.
Since China's 4G capex peak in 2015, demand from telecom customers have
retreated. We believe the upcoming 5G construction cycle will be another major
boost for the Innolight's topline performance. We forecast that the total number of
the global 5G base stations will double that in the 4G era, leading to significant
volume demand increase for optical transceiver modules. Innolight targets to take
around 30% of the total 5G market share in China.
Forecast
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
Looking into the future, we believe Innolight's 100G and 400G transceiver modules
will be the key growth avenue for the company. With the constantly growing demand
for data from end users, both Datacom and Telecom players are upgrading their
current network with higher data rate transceiver modules. Going forward, 100G and
400G transceiver modules will be the mainstream choice in our view for the data
center access/core layer networks and 5G fronthaul/backhaul networks.
Innolight has planned to invest Rmb 1.13 billion in a new industrial park in Tongling,
Anhui. Upon completion, the new facility is expected to produce 1,600,000 100G
transceiver modules annually and 1,400,000 transceiver modules for 5G wireless
network. Since first launching 400G products in 1Q2017, Innolight has already
shipped a small batch of samples to Amazon and Google for their newly built data
centers, on par with its global integrated peers. In addition, the company has
planned to invest Rmb 440 million to fund a new 400G optical transceiver module
400G optical transceiver modules per year, significantly increasing the current
manufacturing capacity.

Cost structure
COGS and Suppliers
Innolight is a pure-play optical transceiver module manufacturer, while most of its
peers have different levels of vertical integration, especially its global competitors. As
a result, its gross margin trails behind its global peers (cc. 10%), as it needs to
import key optical components, especially laser chips (90% of high end chips for
optical transceiver module are manufactured outside of China) from overseas
suppliers. In 2016, Avago and Google Inc. are the top two suppliers of Innolight, who
accounted for 14.85% of Innolight's total purchase. Japanese optical component
suppliers Mitsubishi and Sumitomo are also the two important chip suppliers for the
company.
R&D
The company has a strong commitment to R&D. According to the management,
Innolight historically spent 20% - 30% of their annual revenue in R&D when they first
started the business. This enabled them to quickly build up their product portfolio.
From 2013, Innolight's R&D spending started to see a decrease from 13% to 6% in
2017. This is largely thanks to the company's fast topline growth and lower R&D
personnel cost in China. The R&D figure is now in line with its domestic competitors
and cc. 6% lower than its global peers, improving the company's operating
leverage. In the future, it can be expected that Innolight's R&D spending will
fluctuate with the product cycle of their new products (e.g. new 400G products ramp
up).
SG&A
The company's lower gross profit margin is further offset by its lower SG&A (ex.
R&D) cost. Innolight's SG&A expenses were relatively stable in the past five years,
at around 6% of the company's total revenue. The figure was higher in 2015 due
to an employee stock incentive plan. In 2015, Innolight's stock-based
compensation was Rmb 3,370 mn vs. Rmb 21 mn and Rmb 1,429 mn for 2014 and
2016 respectively. On average, Innolight's SG&A (ex. R&D) expenses were
significantly lower than its global peers (~7%).
Net profit
On the bottom line, Innolight has outperformed most of its peers in the past five
years, with a stable profit margin at ~10%.

Balance sheet and cash flow
Shorter cash conversion cycle vs. domestic peers
In 2017, Innolight had a cash conversion cycle of 86 days (i.e., 2.9 months), which
was much lower than domestic peers at more than 160 days, and close to that of
overseas players level. The short cash conversion cycle mainly benefits from the
lengthy account payable days. Innolight's longer inventory days and AP days are a
result of the fact that it purchases components from third-party suppliers.

Improving return on equity
Innolight's ROE has improved from 11% in 3Q2017 to 15.4% in 2Q2018, driven by
growth in total asset turnover from 0.6x to 0.7x and net margin improvement from
11.4% to 11.9% over the same period. As we expect the company to continue
gaining market share and enjoy operating leverage, we forecast ROE improving to
26% by 2020E.
Low and stable financial leverage
We see Innolight's financial leverage levels have remained low and stable over the
past 4 quarters, and see it staying low over the next 3 years. Interest coverage ratios
have shown improvement. We do not see any short-term solvency risks on debt
repayments given its current low debt levels.
2018年9月13日

Capex
In 3Q2017, Innolight spent Rmb421mn on capex, accounting for 15.6% of its total
revenue. Capex as % of revenue was at its peak in 4Q2017, then dropped to around
10%. Going forward, we expect Innolight's capex to be around Rmb500mn level in
the next three years.
Free cash flow
We expect Innolight's free cash flow to grow stronger in next three years,
mainly driven by margin improvements.

Valuation: 12-month target price of Rmb46 reflects tariff
uncertainties
We believe P/E is the key valuation metric investors focus on for Innolight, as it takes
into account all the revenue and cost elements affecting earnings (cost structure, capital
structure, effective tax rate, FX, etc.) and also reflects profit making ability. This is also in
line with our valuation methodology for the A-share tech space.
We forecast 34% revenue and 47% EPS CAGR for Innolight over 2018E-2020E, and
apply a 20X P/E multiple on 2019E EPS of Rmb2.29 to reflect our cautious view amid
trade uncertainties. Our 12-month target price of Rmb46 implies 9% upside, and
therefore we initiate at Neutral.
Potential positive catalysts over the next twelve months include:
Volume shipment of 400G products in 2019, Innolight is already shipping in small
volumes to Google and Amazon;
2. 5G module procurement from Telecom customers in 2019, Innolight has already
passed Huawei and ZTE's testing and is shipping in small volumes to them now.
20X is the trough 12-month forward P/E multiple for Innolight compared with a historical
average of 30X since 3Q17 when it was acquired by Zhongji Equipment. Considering
Innolight's above industry revenue/earnings CAGR, we believe 30X is reasonable
under normal circumstances vs. current global peer average of 23X, while we choose
25X for our 10% tariff scenario as this is the midpoint multiple between our No tariff
(30X) and 25% tariff (20X) scenarios.
We also explore different scenarios with the potential tariff, and a probability weighted
theoretical value.
No tariff: Rmb69 (based on 30X P/E on 2019E EPS of Rmb2.29), 64% upside
10% tariff: Rmb48 (based on 25X P/E on 2019E EPS of Rmb1.93), 14% upside
25% tariff: Rmb32 (based on 20X P/E on 2019E EPS of Rmb1.61), 24% downside
Our US macro team assigns a 70% chance of tariff implementation, with 25% on
non-consumer products, and an eventual "deal" to be reached in 12 months' time.
Based on this, we assign a 70% probability to 25% tariff scenario + a 30% probability to
no tariff scenario, to derive an implied value of Rmb29*70%+Rmb69*30%=Rmb43. In
terms of forecasts, we use the "no tariff" scenario given there has been no
implementation to date and will adjust to the tariff level should the tariffs actually be
implemented.
Quotes from US macro team:
While a number of details are uncertain [to Trump Administration's proposed
US$200bn in additional tariffs on China], our Washington team expects the White
2018年9月13日
House to move forward with these tariffs, imposing a rate of 10% on consumer
goods and 25% on other (industrial/intermediate) products.
While the outlook is uncertain, we expect the White House to move forward with
tariffs on the majority of the next round of $200bn in imports proposed in July (70%
chance). We expect that the recently proposed 25% tariff rate (up from the earlier
proposed 10% rate) will be applied to a subset of the $200bn of targeted imports.
However, the decision here is likely to rest in part on whether the recent CNY
depreciation has reversed or continued by the time the decision is made, likely in
September.
We now see USD/CNY weakening further past the psychologically important level of
in 12 months as an eventual "deal" still seems to us as a reasonable base case
assumption.
Where are we vs. consensus?

Key risks: demand, tariff, and Silicon Photonics
1. Stronger or weaker demand from cloud and 5G capex
Our 34% revenue CAGR (2018E-202E) forecast for Innolight is based on resilient
demand from both datacenter expansion and 5G rollout starting in 2H19. If the global
datacenter spending accelerates due to fast growth of global data traffic demand or
slows down due to rising component pricing as a result of the trade war or economic
slowdown in certain markets, Innolight may experience a faster or slower growth
trajectory than what we expect; same is true if China or global 5G rollout progress is
faster or slower than our expectation. Currently, 30% of Innolight's revenue come from
domestic customers' demand and 70% from overseas. Innolight now has very little
exposure to the Telecom market, almost all of its revenue is generated by Datacom
customers.
2. Uncertainties around tariff implementation
Amid the uncertainties around ongoing trade war between the United States and China,
the US has announced a second batch of US$200bn tariff plans at a rate of either 10%
or 25%, which may take effect later this year. Optical transceiver modules will be subject
to the second batch of tariffs. On Sep 7th, the Wall Street Journal reported "Trump
ready to roll with yet more tariffs, hitting $267bn in Chinese goods". On Sep 12th, the
Wall Street Journal reported "U.S. Proposing New Round of Trade Talks With China
before the US$200bn tariff goes into effect. Whether the tariffs will be implemented
eventually and at what rate will they be implemented pose both upside and downside
risks to Innolight' s fundamental business as well as share price. For more details
please see our scenario analysis on potential US tariff impact and stress-testing the
supply chain.
3. Competition from Silicon Photonics
What is Silicon Photonics?
2018年9月13日
Silicon Photonics is an emerging technology that uses semiconductor-grade silicon as
the platform for the integration of active and passive photonic circuits along with
electronic components on a single micro-chip. Silicon photonic devices can be made
using existing semiconductor fabrication techniques, resulting in high-volume production
with low cost. Since 2000, companies like Intel, IBM, Acacia and Luxtera have started to
invest into the space and made visible progress.
Advantages of Silicon Photonics
System integration: Silicon photonics IC integrates waveguides, modulator, detector
and de/mux onto one single chip. According to Finisar, over 84% of the functions are
integrated with high yield at wafer level in a Si fab. As silicon photonic chips are
much smaller than the optical components it replaces, hand assembly of hundreds
of piece parts can be eliminated, significantly reducing manufacturing complexity. In
addition, the small size of a silicon photonic chip also leads to improved chip density.
Low cost: Conventional VCSEL, DML and EML chips use InP or GaAs as raw
material. Per inch, InP costs around $88 and GaAs costs around $55. In
comparison, silicon photonics chips use Si, a semiconductor that can be produced
from sand, which only costs around $2.5 per inch.
Low power consumption: The first generation of CFP2 100G transceiver modules
consumes around 20-24 watts. In comparison, a similar CFP2 100G transceiver
module using silicon photonic chip only uses around 3.5 watts, an 85% improvement
from the conventional module mainly driven by the high level of integration and
compact size of the Silicon Photonics chips.
Scalability: Silicon photonics chips have the capability to incorporate Wavelength
channels of 25G lasers at different wavelengths. With WDM, Silicon photonics
optical transceiver can transmit up to 40 channels of light at different wavelengths,
coupling to a single strand of optical fiber.
Major challenges faced in the 100G optical transceiver market
In 2015, Luxtera unveiled its 100G PSM4 optical transceiver module, supporting
transmission distance of up to 2km. In 2016, Intel, for the first time, announced the
commercial availability and volume production of its 100G silicon photonics optical
transceiver module products in both PSM4 and CWDM4 specifications with transmission
distance of up to 10km. Despite gaining adoption by Datacom customers in the
beginning, Silicon Photonics 100G products face several challenges from conventional
products.
For very short reach links (<100m), VCSEL materially outperforms Silicon Photonics
in all performance metrics (cost/power consumption/density).
For the intermediate reach links (500m-2km), Silicon Photonics products compete
with conventional DML products in both PSM4 and CWDM4 specifications.
Silicon Photonics 100G PSM4 transceiver module is a relatively mature
product, taking up around 50% of the overall 100G PSM4 market share.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
However, as PSM4 structure uses 70% more fibers than CWDM4 structure,
becoming the mainstream choice for data center connections.
For 100G CWDM4 products, Silicon Photonics transceiver module still has not
achieved volume production due to production yield and product reliability
issues (coupling error, separate laser problem, low economies of scale for
CMOS and immature upstream supply chain).
M&A rank for Innolight
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering
both qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and
regions) to incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then
to 3, with 1 representing high (30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an
acquisition target, 2 representing medium (15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low
(0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2, in line with our standard
departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our target price. M&A
rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price target, and
may or may not be discussed in research.
We have previously examined our Asia Pacific technology coverage using an M&A
framework (see "Navigating the noise (6): Introduce M&A framework, update
roadmap", July 4, 2016). In the framework, we examine companies' potential as M&A
targets and rank them from 1 to 3 based on our assessment of three key factors.
Firstly, we look at whether there are any impediments, such as shareholder
structure/preferences, industry regulations/government policies, and takeover defense
strategies that could prevent a transaction from occurring. We then consider four
qualitative factors
attractiveness of technology, attractiveness of customers, cost
synergy potential, and other/intangible value
and two quantitative factors
market
cap and valuations.
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
We gauge whether there are any impediments to M&A because, if there are, a company
is unlikely to become an M&A target even if it ranks 1 or 2 on qualitative/quantitative
criteria.
When assessing potential impediments, we take into consideration:
Major shareholder preferences (we assume that shareholders with a 20% or
greater stake have significant influence, or a blocking stake), and take into account: any
potential actions by major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third
party (including whether they would likely be receptive, or if they may be opposed to
selling), or if they have announced a preference to raise their stake in the company;
2018年9月13日
Regulatory and or government policy impediments; and
Possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill.
We assign a "No" qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are
applicable and a "Yes" qualification if these considerations do not apply.
Four qualitative assessment criteria
Technology: We look at whether or not a company has attractive technology
capable of generating future value, as well as its technological capabilities and
intellectual property rights. We assign a rank of "3" if its technology is unattractive,
"2" if it is moderately attractive, and "1" if it is very attractive.
Customer base: We look at whether or not a company has an attractive customer
base and product applications. We also take customer retention and end-market
exposure (including sales channels) into account. We assign a rank of "3" if its
customer base and product applications are unattractive, "2" if they are moderately
attractive, "1" if they are attractive.
Cost synergies: We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for
profit margin/ yield improvement via acquisition of an M&A target company. We assign a
rank of "3" if there is low possibility of synergies, "2" if there is some possibility,
"1" if there is high possibility.
Other: We look at whether or not a target company possesses attractive assets,
including brand strength, outstanding management/employees, and intangible assets.
We assign a rank of "3" if they are unattractive, "2" if they are moderately
attractive, "1" if they are attractive.
Two quantitative assessment criteria
Market cap: We score a company based on the assumption that the smaller it is the
easier it is to acquire. We also take regional qualities (such as differing market cap
ranges between regions) into account.
Valuation: We look at whether a target company's three-year average P/E and
EV/DACF are below the industry/peer average for the same period, as we believe
companies trading at a discount to peers are more likely to be acquired. We assign a
score of "3" if the company appears overvalued relative to its respective industry
"2" if its valuation is in line with the peer average, "1" if its valuation
peer group,
is discounted. We take into account differing valuation multiple ranges between the
companies depending on their region and their peers.
2018年9月13日
全球投资研究
中际旭创 (300308.SZ)
Within this overall framework, we assign an M&A rank of '3' to Innolight. When
Innolight was purchased by the listed Zhongji Equipment in 2017, the effective
controller/controlling shareholder of the listed company (Mr. Wang Xiuwei, Chairman of
Zhongji Equipment) made a promise to voluntarily remain as controlling shareholder and
will not assist any party in seeking controlling shareholder status of the company within
the 60 months of the deal's completion. This promise practically blocks any possibility
for an M&A during the defined period.
However, we believe M&A may be a possible scenario after the defined five year period
given:
The company's strategy advisor (former Chairman) historically co-founded several
firms within the industry and sold to larger players later on. In 1995, he sold SDL, an
optical equipment company to JDSU (later split into Lumentum and Viavi) for $41 billion.
In 2000, he co-founded Pine Photonics Communications with Innolight's current CMO
Mr. Osa Mok. During his five year tenure at the company, he worked with Liu Sheng,
Innolight's current CEO, who was serving as the head of Pine Photonics' China R&D
center. Innolight's current CTO, Wei-long William Lee also worked in Pine Photonics at
the time as a senior optical engineer. The company was later sold to Opnext, the
optoelectronics spin-off of Japan's Hitachi. Mr. Liu Sheng continued to serve in Opnext
as a senior manager in R&D before founding Innolight in 2008. We believe this
experience makes Innolight's current key management open to the idea of an M&A
exit if a situation were to present itself.
