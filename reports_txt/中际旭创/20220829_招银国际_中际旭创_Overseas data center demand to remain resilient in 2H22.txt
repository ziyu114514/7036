positive on overseas clients' capex growth given their reaffirmed commitment to
invest in technology infrastructure even in this tough macro environment. We
maintain BUY rating and adjust TP to RMB42.0, reflecting softer-than-expected
domestic demand for optical transceivers.

■ Innolight's 2Q sales grew 2.6% QoQ, in line with expectations. By
geography, overseas sales contribution increased significantly from 75.1% in
FY21 to 85.6% in 1H22. This is mainly due to strong demand from overseas

cloud companies and relatively soft demand from domestic ICPs.
Amazon/Google/Meta's total capex grew 34.9%/23.6% YoY in 1Q/2Q22. The
surging demand for 200G/400G transceivers created favorable product mix.
We see 2Q GPM grew to 27.3% vs. 26.3% in 1Q. As the market continues to

embrace higher bandwidth (e.g., continuous migration to 200G/400G, deploy
800G optical modules starts from 4Q22), we believe Innolight can benefit from
this trend.
Looking forward, we remain positive on overseas clients' capex growth.
Although we see many companies are being disciplined or even cut on

spending, large cloud leaders (AMAN/GOOG/FB/MSFT) all confirmed of
continuous investments in technology infrastructure. However, the market
seems to be less confident in Innolight's clients' demand, especially when
Amazon and Meta guided lower-than-average sales growth for 3Q (-2% and -
6%) and reduced hiring plans, suggesting weak consumer spending. Contrary

to the consensus, we are more opportunistic than the market, considering
resources should be allocated to key growth drivers, which will help boost
performance when macro recovers.

■ Maintain BUY and TP adjusted to RMB42.0. Innolight is a major beneficiary
of cloud capex growth. We maintained positive outlook for its overseas

business but lowered forecasts for domestic sales. New TP of RMB42.0 is
based on 26x 23E P/E. Potential risks include 1) reduced capex from global
cloud companies, 2) slower deployment of 5G infrastructure and 3) faster-
than-expected tech advancement.
