司近十年來首次送股，將提升流動性。
具體而言，醫藥工業業務營收 58.5 億元,同比增長 17.8%,毛率 80.5%,
維持快速增長趨勢。公司核心品種百令膠囊收入突破 20 億元,增速逾 20%,阿
卡波糖則超過 15 億元,增幅近 30%,免疫抑制劑三個主要品種環孢素、嗎替麥
考酚酯、他克莫司合計營收約10億元。
商業業務實現營收 201 億元,同比增長 16.4%,毛利率 7.9%,維持在 8%左
右,主要得益於浙江省醫藥商業行業集中度提升。還值一提的是,公司正從傳
統流通商轉向綜合健康服務供應商，子公司寧波公司在醫美和大健康領域精耕

費用方面,2016 年財務費用 0.9 億元,同比下降 1.2 億元,因公司定增
34.7 億元明顯改善財務狀況,這也是業績增速明顯快于營收增速的主要因素。
醫保目錄調整助力快速成長
根據 2017 版醫保目錄,公司 3 個藥品新納入,阿卡波糖片由乙類調整爲甲
類,另有他克莫司膠囊等 3 個產品取消了適用症,因此,公司成爲新版目錄主
要受惠者之一。
百令從腫瘤輔助用藥改爲氣血雙補劑,利好未來進行多科室拓展。而且,
百令膠囊市場目前主要以城區公立醫院爲主,未來分級診療推進將帶動整體市
場擴大。同時,江東年產 1200 噸發酵冬蟲夏草菌粉專案(一期專案)順利通過
GMP 現場核查,有效解決產能瓶頸問題。我們預期百令有望維持 20%以上增速。
阿卡波糖由乙類升級爲甲類，終端支付能力提升有望形成放量效應。目前
阿卡波糖市場主要以原研廠商拜耳爲主，但華東醫藥及綠葉產品具備價格優
勢，不僅在招標中有競爭力，在基層覆蓋率也超過原研藥，未來進口替代效應
將進一步提升,總體預計維持30%以上增速。

此外，達托黴素、吲哚布芬等首仿或獨家品種進入醫保，未來亦將隨著招
標推進進一步放量。目前，達托黴素已在上海中標。而且，新版目錄取消了他
克莫司口服製劑和環孢素的適應症限制，還將有利於其進行多科室推廣。
產品儲備豐富
目前，除了強化腎病、內分泌、免疫抑制、消化系統等專科領域外，公司
還努力拓展抗腫瘤、抗重症感染與心血管等新領域。2016年公司共取得甲磺酸
伊馬替尼片、利奈唑胺片等 13 個臨床批件，獲得了百令顆粒劑、吲哚布芬片、
地西他濱原料及製劑 4 個生產批件。此外,泮立蘇粉針方面,公司還是國內首
家向美國 FDA 遞交 ANDA 申請並受理,並啟動了他克莫司膠囊在海外的臨床研
究。因此，公司在藥品製劑的產品梯隊還將爲未來發展提供動力。
主要產品降價超預期;
產品推廣不及預期;
“兩票制”落地低於預期。
