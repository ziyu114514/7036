度均價約爲 6.6/7.5 萬元每噸,相比去年同期 9.7/13.5 萬元的均價,大幅下跌了 33-

公司斥巨資 40.7 億美元收購 SQM 股權產生了 35 億美元的債務,長期借款由去年同期
的 18.8 億飈升至 282 億人民幣,淨負債率達到 266%。前三個季度的財務費用高達

5.1/5/6.4 億元,單季財務費用高于 2018 年全年的 4.7 億元。資産收購帶來的財務費用
縣漲是公司業績重挫的主要原因。
此外,收購後 SQM 業績表現未達預期,令公司的投資收益逐季减少,前三季分別爲
1.39/0.94/0.77 億元。

財務資料
募集不超過 70 億元，擬全部用于償還購買 SQM 股權的幷購貸款。此外公司還計劃運
用包括中短期票據、美元債和可轉債在內的多種融資方式緩解償還幷購貸款本息的壓
力,降低財務費用。若成功募集,公司的財務壓力將得到有效緩解。
鋰價有望受益于供需結構好轉，觸底回升
碳酸鋰價格目前跌破 6 萬每噸,低于許多企業的成本綫,行業位于高成本産能出清的
前夜。需求方面，短期內動力電池將迎來開工旺季，中長期來看歐洲新的排放標準和
電動車補貼政策將爲原材料鋰的需求帶來支撑。總體來說，未來鋰價下行空間有限，
而上行彈性將逐漸顯現。
