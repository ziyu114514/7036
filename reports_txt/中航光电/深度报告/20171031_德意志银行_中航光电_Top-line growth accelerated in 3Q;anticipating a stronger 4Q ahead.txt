Near-term growth to further accelerate; long-term visibility improving
Research Analyst
Despite c.40% share price appreciation YTD (vs. SZCOMP: +3%), we see further
upside potential for Jonhon as re-rating continues to accelerate earnings growth
along with improved visibility. Revenue growth indeed accelerated in 3Q. With

4Q to deliver 38% NP growth. Looking beyond 2017, the upcoming two rounds
of capacity expansions will likely lift its headquarter's capacity by c.50%, and
the new capacity will be mainly used for new products and applications that
Price/price relative
have substantial import substitution potential. During the previous capacity
expansion cycle (2014-15), Jonhon delivered earnings CAGR of 50%+. We have
been anticipating an earnings upcycle for the coming three years, and we now
have higher conviction. We see upside potential to our current assumption of a
constant growth acceleration of 30%+ towards 2020; maintaining Buy.
Sales growth accelerated; margin expansion continued

Shenzhen Index (Rebased)
3Q sales of Rmb1.5bn rose 8% yoy, a visible acceleration from 1H's 1% yoy
growth. High GPM was largely sustained in 3Q, which increased 2.5ppt yoy,
leading to a 16% growth in GP. However, this was partially offset by higher opex
and finance costs in 3Q. NP was up 13% yoy, which also accelerated from 1H's
11% increase. 9M NP amounted to Rmb629m (+12% yoy), which achieved 73%

During our recent visit to Jonhon's Luoyang headquarters (in mid-September),
Price/book (x)
management indicated that new orders for defense and NEV picked up since

the beginning of 3Q (see our trip takeaway note). However, the actual signing

of contracts took place in late 3Q (especially for defense orders, largely due to

military reform), which means revenue conversion will likely be skewed towards
the final quarter. The company guides for a 0-15% NP growth for the full year, the
same wide range they guided for in 1H and 9M. Its track record suggests that the
final result tends to come in towards the high end of the guided range. For this
year we expect full-year earnings growth to beat guidance (DBe: +18% yoy) as
we are projecting a 38% earnings growth in 4Q.
More capacity expansions, more applications and higher growth visibility
The company recently unveiled its plan to issue convertible bonds of up to
Rmb1.3bn, >70% of which will be used for capacity expansions including
Luoyang Phase III (announced in 2016) and Phase IV (announced this month).

Based on the current progress, we believe the new capacity will be gradually
released starting in 2018, with the majority of the capacity coming online during
2019-20. Upon completion, these two production plants will likely lift its Luoyang
headquarters' production capacity by c.50%. More importantly, in addition to
upgrading and expanding its existing capacity for NEV, fiber cable and system
integration, the new capacity will be used for new products such as high-speed
backplane connectors, liquid-cooling connectors, high-end optical connectors
and new applications in healthcare, nuclear power and deepwater; the domestic
connector markets for which are dominated by foreign players, hence huge import
substitution potential. We see higher long-term growth visibility as a result of
planned capacity expansions and strongly believe the 2013-15 earnings upcycle
(+41% EPS CAGR) could be repeated in 2018-20.
Retaining estimates and maintaining Buy; risks
We keep our earnings estimates unchanged after the 3Q results and maintain
Buy. We base our target price on a 2018E P/E of 30x, supported by an earnings
CAGR of 33% over 2017-19E. Key risks: further delay in military orders and higher-
than-expected opex.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to
specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
