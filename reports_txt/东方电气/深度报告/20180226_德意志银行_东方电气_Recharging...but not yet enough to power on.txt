Earnings seem to have stabilized; upgrading H-share to Hold

Following a 40% underperformance (relative to HSCEI index) over the past one
year, we are upgrading Dongfang Electric-H to Hold from Sell, as we believe

a reflection of demand recovery in core operations but driven by better-than-
expected cost reduction. The scope for further cost cuts is limited. We also do not
see support yet for a Buy case for its H-share. Against revised ROE assumptions
of 3-4% for 2018-19E, we believe our target P/B of 0.6x on 2018E is fair.
Power equipment: it seems that the worst is not yet over
Coal-fired (c.50% of total GP): Based on our utility team's projections,
annual capacity additions will fall to 30-40GW over 2017-19 (vs. 40-70GW
over 2014-16) and drop significantly to 11GW by 2020. Beyond 2020,
annual capacity additions will likely continue to fall to a sustained low
level of 5-10GW.
level will likely stay at c.22GW over 2018-20E (vs. 19-21GW in 2016-17).
In addition to limited industry growth, Dongfang has been struggling in
terms of market position (its market share has halved since 2011) and
profitability (only a single-digit GPM).
Nuclear power (c.10% of total GP): Approvals for new nuclear projects
clearly disappointed the market in 2017, against the high hopes. This
limits Dongfang's ability to convert its revenue in 2018 (under the
percentage-of-completion accounting method). We would prefer to stay
on the sidelines until we see concrete signs of a resumption in approvals.
Non-power equipment: not enough to drive a rerating
Overseas EPC: In light of the power equipment downturn and the
OBOR initiative, Dongfang clearly puts more emphasis on the overseas
EPC business. However, revenue conversion has failed to come through
despite a high backlog coverage of >5x. Given the uncertainties
associated with the execution of overseas projects, visibility of a
significant take-off of the business in 2018 is low. Moreover, Chinese
constructors' subdued valuations (at an average P/B of 0.6-0.7x on 2018E)
do not seem to support a rerating case for Dongfang.

aware that the firm may have a conflict of interest that could affect the objectivity of this report. Investors should consider
this report as only a single factor in making their investment decision. DISCLOSURES AND ANALYST CERTIFICATIONS
ARE LOCATED IN APPENDIX 1. MCI (P) 083/04/2017. The content may not be distributed in The People's Republic of China
("The PRC") (except in compliance with the applicable laws and regulations of PRC), excluding Special Administrative
Regions of Hong Kong and Macau.
Power plant services: Management has been bullish on the segment's
growth outlook. However, even at the assumed 25-30% revenue growth
for 2018-19E, GP contribution would reach only 12% by 2019E.
Earnings stabilization hinges upon cost reduction
Asset impairment losses, a key swing factor in earnings since 2015, seem
to have narrowed and there are signs of stabilization ahead. According to
Dongfang's 2017 earnings preview, selling expenses (which mainly include
warranty expenses) and asset impairment losses dropped 40% yoy. In our view,
these were the key drivers of its earnings turnaround in 2017, in addition to
margin normalization in its wind power, hydro power and construction business.
However, given the ongoing thermal equipment downturn, we don't see much
scope for further improvement in cost.
Upgrading H-share to Hold; reiterating Sell on A-share
Incorporating the 2017 earnings preview and latest company guidance, we
raise our earnings forecasts for 2018/19E, driven mainly by cost assumptions
(impairment losses and warranty expenses in particular). We raise our target
prices to HKD7.0 for the H-share and to Rmb5.7 for the A-share. We upgrade
the H-share to Hold as we believe the current valuation (0.6x P/B on 2018E) is
fair relative to our revised ROE assumption of c.3% for 2018. We reiterate Sell on
the A-share, given a rich valuation (at 1.0x 2018E P/B). Key risks: 1) better/worse-
than-expected delays/cancellations in thermal power projects and faster/slower-
than-expected progress in nuclear power projects.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including: (i) exchange rates can
be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous market factors,

interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls, which could
affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the currency of an
