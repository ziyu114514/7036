operating cash flow improved significantly to RMB4.38bn (vs -RMB1.6bn in

Valuation. We revise up our TP to RMB14.8, based on 24x 2024E P/E
which is equivalent to 0.5SD above the average of 20x since 2017 (previous
TP: RMB12.3, based on 19x). We now apply an above average target
multiple as we see initial signs of stabilisation of excavator sales in China's
market, and we expect a moderate recovery in 2025E.
Upside risk: stabilization of property investment in China; Downside risk:

further slowdown of overseas demand.
