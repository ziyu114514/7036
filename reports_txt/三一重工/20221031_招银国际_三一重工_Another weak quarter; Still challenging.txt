forecast by 52%/38%/36% (37%-44% below consensus), largely a result of lower

Our above average target multiple is to reflect potential earnings recovery in

the lack of upside potential.
■ Key highlights in 3Q22 results. Revenue dropped 8% YoY to RMB19bn.
Gross margin slightly improved 0.6ppt QoQ but still dropped 1.1ppt YoY to
23.8%. Selling & distribution expense ratio increased 2.9ppt YoY to 8.4%,
while R&D expense ratio also increased 2ppt YoY to 8.4%. All these drove the
Shareholding Structure
EBIT down 91% YoY to only RMB158mn. Net profit declined 61% YoY to
RMB963mn, with profit largely contributed by the finance income and other
gains. Operating cash inflow increased 12% YoY to RMB500mn. In 9M22,
revenue / net profit dropped 33%/71% YoY to RMB3.6bn.
Overseas accounted for 46% of total revenue in 3Q22. We calculate that
the overseas revenue in 3Q22 surged 68% YoY to ~RMB9.3bn, driven largely
by excavators (+89% YoY, 49% of total overseas revenue). In 9M22, overseas
revenue grew 44% YoY to RMB25.9bn. We believe overseas market will
continue to serve as a key growth engine that offsets the weakness in China.
Bear case scenario: 1.5x P/B. We still value SANY with earnings multiple at

present. That said, we think market will potentially switch to asset-based
valuation if the downcycle continues. We see 1.5x forward P/B (equivalent to

Upside risk: (1) stabilization of property investment; Downside risks: (1)
