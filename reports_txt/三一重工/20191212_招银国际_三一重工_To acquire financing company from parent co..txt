SANY Capital (“三一汽车金融”) from SANY Group (parent company of SANY
Heavy) for cash consideration of RMB3.98bn. The implied valuation of 24.4x
2018 P/E and 1.5x P/B (equity as at Oct 2019) does not look attractive, in our
China Capital Goods
view. Besides, an additional liability of RMB6.8bn will be consolidated in SANY
Heavy's balance sheet upon completion (attributable liabilities: RMB6.4bn). That
Wayne Fung, CFA
said, we believe the overall impact on SANY Heavy is limited given that the deal
size is not substantial. We estimate the earnings accretive will be <1%. We have
left our forecast unchanged as the deal is subject to shareholders' approval.

companies approved by CBIRC in China. SANY Capital is mainly engaged in
machinery financing business. SANY Group, parent company of SANY Heavy,
currently owns 91.43% stake in SANY Capital, while SANY Heavy owns 3%

income of RMB235mn in 10M19 and net profit of RMB84mn. The book value

12-mth Price Performance
Not attractive due to high valuation and increased liabilities. We calculate
that the implied P/E (based on earnings in 2018) reached 24.4x. Besides, the
acquisition cost of RMB3.98bn plus the increased attributable liabilities of
RMB6.4bn (RMB6.8bn x 94.43%) from SANY Capital will result in a reduction
of attributable net cash by >RMB10bn, though we think is still manageable
due to the Company's strong free cash flow.
Key risks: (1) Cyclical nature; (2) Risk of overseas business; (3) Increase in
raw material cost; (4) Risk of expanding to financing business.
