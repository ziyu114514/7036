surged 65% YoY to 26k units in Sep, the highest growth rate since May. Large

Shareholding Structure
Raise industry sales projection. Based on Jiangsu Hengli's (601100 CH,
BUY) latest production plan of hydraulic cylinders (see our latest note on
Hengli [link]), we foresee strong excavator demand growth with high visibility
in 4Q20E. We raise our industry excavator sales volume assumption in
2020E/21E by 13%/10%. We expect 35%/3% YoY growth in 2020E/21E, with
key drivers coming from resilient construction activities, replacement of labour

import substitution and export market are two structural drivers for SANY
going forward.

growth in 3Q20E, driven by 44% YoY increase in revenue and operating
leverage. SANY is scheduled to report on 29 Oct.
■ Key risks: (1) Risk of overseas business due to pandemic; (2) Slowdown of
construction activities; (3) Risk of expanding to financing business.
