pricing pressure. We also lower GPM projections by 9ppts/7ppts to 32%/37% in
2025/26E, factoring in near-term margin headwinds from elevated depreciation.

Revenue declined on soft demand, while product development

progress stayed intact. China's smartphone shipment grew 3.3% YoY in
1Q25 on government subsidies but decreased 4%/4% YoY/QoQ in 2Q as
demand fell. The weak recovery in market demand (2025 smartphone

shipment to grow by 0.6%/1.9% YoY, per IDC/Counterpoint) and slower-
than-expected industry consolidation weighed on Maxscend's performance.
1H25 sales dropped 25% YoY, although RF modules now accounted for 44%
of total revenue, up from 36%/42% in FY23/24. This shift demonstrates the

company's progress in product development (i.e., L-PAMiD, equipped with
in-house MAX-SAW, reflecting a fully localized supply chain). We expect
module revenue to exceed 50% of total sales in 2027E, aligning with industry
modularization and localization trends. However, without a strong rebound
in demand, we expect Maxscend's overall revenue to decrease by 9% in
2025E.
Margin headwinds persist. Maxscend booked a D&A expense of
RMB323mn in 1H25, up 22% YoY from RMB265mn in 1H24. Although
depreciation growth may have peaked, absolute expense is expected to
remain elevated in the near term as the company ramps up its 12-inch IPD
line (1H25 capacity: 5kwm). We think improved fab utilization across the 6-

Maintain HOLD. We see 2025-26E as transitioning years for Maxscend. Our
new TP is based on 45x 2026E EV/EBITDA (vs. prior 45x 2026E P/E),
slightly higher than 0.5-SD below 5-year historical avg. of 44x, reflecting
ongoing business model shift toward fab-lite/IDM. While Maxscend is well-
positioned in the RFFE market and China's localization, we think its margin
recovery may take another year. Upside catalysts: stronger-than-expected
recovery, accelerated localization. Potential downside risks: slower capacity
ramp-up, R&D delays.
