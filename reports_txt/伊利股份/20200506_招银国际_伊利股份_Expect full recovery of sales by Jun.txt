■ FY20E guidance. Yili sets its total revenue and PBT target at RMB97bn and
RMB6.1bn in FY20E, representing 7.5% YoY growth and 26% YoY decrease,
respectively. This implies 14% YoY growth/13% YoY decline for total
revenue/PBT, respectively, during 2-4Q20. That said, excluding government
grant and share award expenses, management expects adi. NP to resume
growth in 2-4Q20. Going forward, while Yili still focuses on domestic dairy
business, it will develop Southeast Asia market and develop healthy drinks
business.
