业绩点评: 重 申新视角看乳业,强调竞争拐点已现
Reiterate a New Perspective on the Dairy Industry and Emphasize the Turning Point of Competition has Appeared
观点聚焦 Investment Focus
(Please see APPENDIX 1 for English summary)
2022 年顺利收官, 2023 年拐点向上。公司 2022 年实现营业总收
入 1231.7 亿元(+11.4%), 归母净利润 94.3 亿元(+8.3%)。公司
2022Q4 营业总收入 293.1 亿元 (+14.5%), 归母净利润 13.7 亿元
(+80.1%)。公司 23Q1 实现营业总收入 334.4 亿元(+7.7%), 归
母净利润 36.2 亿元(+2.7%)。23 年公司计划实现营收 1355 亿元
(+10.4%), 利润总额 125 亿元(+17.9%)。对应利润率(利润总
额/营业收入)达到 9.2%, 同比大幅提升 60 个基点(2022 年因疫
情影响+澳优并表影响下降50个基点)。该经营目标超预期,彰显
了管理层对 23 年需求恢复和公司利润率扩张的信心。
液态奶环比修复,品类结构持续上移。22年液体乳/奶粉及奶制品
/冷饮产品分别实现收入849.3/262.6/95.7亿元,同比0.0%/+62.0%/
+33.6%, 毛利率分别为 29.1%/41.1%/38.5%。同比+0.78/+1.84/
-1.79PCT。其中 22Q4 液体乳/奶粉及奶制品/冷饮产品分别实现收
入 208.2/75.3/3.7 亿元, 同比+3.1%/+65%/+72.1%, 23Q1 分别实现
收入 217.4/74.4/37.9 亿元,同比-2.6%/+37.9%/+35.7%。液态奶板
块来看,考虑春节错期影响, Q1 液态奶收入同比有所下降,但
Q4+Q1 持平,相较 22Q2 跌幅-4.5%, 22Q3 跌幅-4.9%明显收窄。
23Q2-Q3 均为低基数,后期表观增速有保障,真实需求有刚性。奶
粉板块来看，同时剔除澳优并表影响，我们测算伊利内生奶粉达
到 25%+增速, 其中成人粉约 15%, 婴配粉约 35%+。
毛利率在上升通道,费用率确定向下。2022年公司毛利率/销售费
用率/管理费用率/净利率分别为 32.4%/18.7%/ 4.4%/ 7.6%, 同比
+1.7/+1.1/+0.5/-0.3pct。 澳优去年业绩承压, 基本未贡献利润, 但
剔除澳优影响, 内生净利率仍扩张 10 个基点, 体现公司内生经营
韧性。2023 年 Q1 分别为 34.0%/17.1%/4.2%/10.8%，同比-0.7/-1.1/
+0.9/-0.5pct。公司毛利率因奶粉等高毛利产品放量，仍在持续上
升通道,回顾历史自 2020 年 30.2%提升至 2022 年 32.4%,可持续
性强。2022 年因疫情影响费效比较低,销售费用率被动上升,但
23Q1 已验证趋势向下，全年费效比仍持续提升。
乳业长逻辑仍在验证，净利率提升大势所趋。我们重申乳业竞争
拐点已现的观点,该宏观逻辑持续被验证。首先,企业战略并未
改变,伊利并未改变 2025 年净利率 9%以上的长期目标。蒙牛亦
坚持 OPM 每年 30-50 bp 的目标。其次, 乳业销售费用率在持续下
降, 伊利 23Q1 销售费用率 (-1.1PCT) 和蒙牛 22H2 销售费用率
(-3.6PCT)都为大幅向下趋势,可以作证的是,2022-2023年原奶
下行周期, 双寡头也未出现价格战情况。市场对竞争格局不必过
于担忧, 建议以全新视角看乳业。

财务报表分析和预测
Summary
2022 ended smoothly, and the inflection point in 2023 is upward. In 2022, the company achieved a total operating income of
123.17 billion yuan (+11.4%), and a net profit attributable to the parent of 9.43 billion yuan (+8.3%). The company's total operating
income in 2022Q4 was 29.31 billion yuan (+14.5%), and the net profit attributable to the parent was 1.37 billion yuan (+80.1%). In
23Q1, the company achieved a total operating income of 33.44 billion yuan (+7.7%) and a net profit attributable to the parent of
basis points year-on-year (down 50 basis points in 2022 due to the impact of the epidemic + the impact of Ausnutria consolidation).
This operating target exceeded expectations, demonstrating management's confidence in the recovery of 23-year demand and
the expansion of the company's profit margin.
Liquid milk was repaired month-on-month, and the category structure continued to move upward. In 22 years, liquid milk/milk
powder and dairy products/cold drink products achieved revenue of 84.93/26.26/9.57 billion yuan, respectively,
0.0%/+62.0%/+33.6% year-on-year, and gross profit margin was 29.1%/41.1%/38.5% respectively. +0.78/+1.84/-1.79 PCT year-on-
year. Among them, 22Q4 liquid milk/milk powder and dairy products/cold drink products achieved revenue of 20.82/7.53/0.
37billion yuan, +3.1%/+65%/+72.1% year-on-year, respectively, and 23Q1 achieved revenue of 21.74/7.44/3.79 billion yuan, -
2.6%/+37.9%/+35.7% year-on-year. In the liquid milk sector, considering the impact of the Spring Festival period, Q1 liquid milk
revenue decreased year-on-year, but Q4+Q1 was flat, down -4.5% compared with 22Q2, and -4.9% in 22Q3. 23Q2-Q3 are low base,
the apparent growth rate in the later period is guaranteed, and the real demand is rigid. From the perspective of the milk powder
sector, while excluding the impact of Ausnutria consolidation, we estimate that Yili's endogenous milk powder has reached a
growth rate of 25%+, of which about 15% for adult powder and about 35%+ for infant powder.
The gross margin is in the upward channel, and the expense ratio is determined downward. In 2022, the company's gross
margin/sales expense ratio/management expense ratio/net profit margin will be 32.4%/18.7%/4.4%/7.6%, respectively,
+1.7/+1.1/+0.5/-0.3pct year-on-year. Ausnutria's performance last year was under pressure and basically did not contribute profit,
but excluding the impact of Ausnutria, the endogenous net profit margin still expanded by 10 basis points, reflecting the company's
endogenous operational resilience. In Q1 2023, it was 34.0\%/17.1\%/4.2\%/10.8\%, respectively, -0.7/-1.1/+0.9/-0.5 pct year-on-year.
The company's gross profit margin is still rising due to the volume of high gross profit products such as milk powder, and the review
history has increased from 30.2% in 2020 to 32.4% in 2022, which is highly sustainable. In 2022, due to the relatively low cost-
effectiveness affected by the epidemic, the sales expense ratio passively increased, but the 23Q1 verified downward trend, and
the cost-effectiveness ratio continued to improve throughout the year.
The long-term logic of the dairy industry is still being verified, and the net profit margin is trending. We reiterate our view that the
inflection point of the dairy industry has been reached, and this macro logic continues to be validated. First of all, the corporate
strategy has not changed, and Yili has not changed its long-term goal of net profit margin of more than 9% in 2025. Mengniu also
adheres to the OPM target of 30-50 bp per year. Secondly, the sales expense ratio of the dairy industry continues to decline, Yili
23Q1 sales expense ratio (-1.1PCT) and Mengniu 22H2 sales expense ratio (-3.6PCT) are both sharply downward, it can be testified
that in the downward cycle of raw milk in 2022-2023, the duopoly has not seen a price war. The market does not need to worry
too much about the competitive landscape, and it is recommended to look at the dairy industry from a fresh perspective.
Profit forecast and investment advice: Considering the recovery of the business and raising the profit forecast, we expect the
company's operating income from 2023 to 2025 to be 136.96/151.99/167.15 billion yuan respectively (the previous forecast is
139.18/154.33 billion yuan), a year-on-year increase of 11.2%/11.0%/10.0%; Net profit attributable to owners was
11.25/13.50/15.87 billion yuan (previous forecast was 11.10/12.78 billion yuan), a year-on-year increase of 19.3%/20.0%/17.5%;
EPS was 1.76/2.11/2.48 yuan respectively (previous forecast was 1.73/2.00 yuan). Given the valuation of comparable companies,
and considering the industry may recover in the future, we value the company with a 25x PE of 2023 to reach our target price of
44CNY. We maintain the OUTPERFORM rating.
Risk warning: the recovery of some categories is less than expected, and the consumption macro environment is sluggish.
