■ Earnings change. We lower our 2023-24E revenue by 3% each to reflect
our concern. We also trim our gross margins by 0.4pp to reflect the
destocking impact from smaller IMF brands upon the enactment of the new
license legislation. These are partially mitigated by a 0.2pp lower in SG&A
ratio, and result in a 2% cut in our 2023E net profits.
Valuation. Our new TP is based on an updated 21.0x (from previously

Yili (600887 CH, BUY) and Feihe (6186 HK, HOLD) at -1sd below average,
in view of a lukewarm dairy demand amid a faltering consumption recovery.
