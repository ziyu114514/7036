Where we are different (1): Renewables intake as a structural
tailwind to benefit secondary equipment the most
The market may underestimate the longer-term sustainability of grid investment growth
in our view, which is often perceived as cyclically driven by policies and project
(especially UHV) construction cycle. As we discussed in our report, China Grid Tech:
Grid transformation: From cyclical to structural, we believe China's grid network is on
the verge of a transformative shift and expect growing renewables in-take in particular
and slight contribution from data center & Al power consumption will likely drive nearly
60% of incremental investments over 2024-2030E, with total grid investment increasing
at a robust 8% CAGR and smart grid rising from 13.7% of total grid spending to 16% in
2030E, which will focus on advanced systems to regulate, dispatch, and process
real-time data for efficient power allocation.
China's power grids are indeed much newer than those of the EU/US, however
renewables just reached 15% of total energy generation in China, and we forecast this
to grow to 35% in 2030E. Germany's experience is instructive: In 2011-2023,
Germany's renewable energy share surged from 11% to 39% of total generation,
accompanied by a fourfold increase in grid T&D (transmission & distribution) investment
(made by companies like TenneT and E.ON). While interruptions from volatility and
intermittency have been minimal in China, potential grid shocks cannot be ignored.
Additionally, we believe fast-growing AI training & inference capex investment that follow
the trend in US, as well as proliferating smart devices for growing charging needs in
China, will potentially provide further upside. We expect data centers' contribution to
total power consumption will rise from 1.6% in 2023 to 5% in 2030E with AI taking up
around 12% of it.

The biggest driver for power grid investment growth now is the relevant intelligent
infrastructure to ensure the smooth integration of renewable energy and reliability of
power system:
Smart Power Generation
Renewable energy like wind and solar is volatile and intermittent, requiring advanced
grid adjustment systems. Coal power is the primary tool for flexibility, managing peaks
and troughs in renewable output. Nari Tech offers renewable energy generation control
solutions that integrate advanced systems like AGC, AVC, and FFR to ensure frequency
stability, voltage regulation, and reliable power quality.
Smart Dispatch
Real-time control has replaced traditional scheduling to integrate renewables effectively.
Accurate forecasting of renewables output, supported by advanced dispatch systems,
enhances grid reliability. Nari Tech's flagship product has been Open-2000 since
establishment, and has a dominant position (70-80% market share) in all five levels of
dispatch system:national, regional, provincial, local, and county. The new dispatch
system rolled out in 2020 has 20% higher content value than the previous iteration.
Smart Substations
Substations address challenges like reverse power flow, overloading, and instability from
distributed renewables. Solutions include reactive power devices, voltage regulation
tools, and equipment upgrades for grid reliability. Nari Tech offers relay protection and
SVC (Static Var Compensator)/STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) in the
smart substations.
Smart Distribution
Modern distribution networks are shifting to active, bidirectional systems. Nari Tech
offers intelligent devices like DTUs, TTUs, FTUs, and RTUs to enable fault detection,
load forecasting, and seamless integration of renewable and EV loads into the grid.
Smart Power Consumption
Users actively participate in energy markets by producing, consuming, and storing
energy. Nari Tech offers smart meters and integrated communication systems to
facilitate informed decision-making and demand-side management, strengthening grid
efficiency.
UHV Transmission
To address the mismatch between resource-rich areas and demand centers, UHV
transmission transfers large-scale clean energy efficiently. Nari Tech offers the key
component, converter valve, in Direct Current UHV lines.

Key changes to the grid and the reasons behind the change
We also expect distribution network investments to grow faster than transmission over
2024-30E, with distribution investment contribution to increase from 56% of total in
2024E to 59% in 2030E. This shift is driven by: the need to modernize local grids to
handle distributed energy resources (DERs), such as rooftop solar and energy storage
systems; expansion of microgrids and enhancements to accommodate the increased
use of electric vehicles and other decentralized loads; efforts to improve power reliability

Where we are different (2): 2025E grid investment to stay strong
but we are slightly above State Grid's target
We expect China's power grid investment, specifically those made by the State Grid,
to reach a new high of Rmb690bn in 2025E with continued fiscal support and slightly
above its announced annual target of Rmb650bn as grid investment is often served as a
counter-cyclical economic policy tool, e.g., in 2008-09 and 2015-16. There will be
continued tailwind from equipment upgrade, as "Implementation Plan for Large-Scale
Equipment Upgrades in Key Energy Areas" aims to increase the scale of energy
equipment investment by 25%+ to 2027, compared to 2023 (c.5% growth per annum).
Among the total investment of Rmb690bn, we estimate 44% goes towards transmission
investment (16% UHV and 27% HV) and 66% to distribution.
2025年1月20日
Goldman Sachs
国电南瑞 (600406.SS)
In terms of the fastest-growing segment in 2025E, we believe it will be UHV transmission
investments. We expect UHV investment to grow 43%/13% yoy in 2025E/26E as project
approval pace accelerates. Compared to four UHV lines starting construction in 2024,
we expect at least six lines starting construction in 2025E-26E. The fast-growing
upstream renewable energy installation requires advanced planning of UHV projects
(the process from environmental assessment, approval, budgeting, design, to
construction typically takes 3-5 years), to prevent the curtailment issue of wind and
solar. At the 2025 National Energy Work Conference (Dec 15, 2024, link), China
announced plans to prioritize the approval and construction of several key UHV projects
in 2025, including corridors from Western Inner Mongolia to Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei,
Southeastern Tibet to the Greater Bay Area, Gansu's Badain Jaran Desert to Sichuan,
and Southern Xinjiang to Sichuan-Chongqing. We expect six new projects starting
construction in 2025E-26E, driving the investments to a record high.

图表 22: Among the 15-16 UHV lines needed for solar and
wind bases under 14th FYP, three lines are under
lines are required for 15th FYP
Three batches of solar and wind bases and corresponding
demand for UHV lines
We believe UHV investments will stay elevated beyond 2025E, supported by strong
demand to transmit the renewable energy from mega bases despite investment yoy
growth slowing down. An UHV line with transmission power of 4-8GW on average can
transmit 10-11GW of renewable energy and 3-4GW of supporting energy. The second
batch of projects planned in 14th FYP (150GW of external transmission) will require
15-16 UHV lines, relying on five lines already in the installed base, and ten additional
new lines (seven lines pending approval). The second batch of projects planned in 15th
FYP (165GW of external transmission) will accordingly require 18-19 UHV lines. 15th
FYP projects, combined with the third batch (40GW of external transmission), provide
strong demand support to continued UHV construction. Additionally, the State Grid has
also announced reserve projects of five AC line and nine DC lines, which we believe will
sustain the UHV construction pace beyond 2025E.
2025年1月20日
Goldman Sachs
On top of UHV growth, Nari Tech will also benefit from the penetration of VSC-HVDC,
where we forecast relay protection and flexible transmission revenue segment to deliver
25%/26% yoy growth in 2025E/26E. About 4-7 months after the start of project
construction, State Grid hosts primary and secondary equipment tendering. If Nari Tech
wins the tender, it usually takes them about a year to deliver the product in order to book
revenue. We think the momentum of strong revenue recognition may sustain into
2026-27E. Nari Tech offers converter valves for UHV projects, whose significance
among UHV equipment increases from 22% in DC lines to 29% in VSC-HVDC lines.
With increased penetration of VSC-DC, the content value for converter valves per GW
grows 2.2X on average compared to a normal DC line, and Nari Tech holds a dominant
market position (c.49%) in both DC and VSC-DC lines.

A key enabler of a smarter, more flexible and more reliable grid
Nari Tech is a key enabler of a smarter, more flexible and more reliable grid, as the
company especially benefits from the structurally growing areas of grid investment, UHV
and smart grid investments. Its products range from power generation control solutions,
dispatch software, components in substations, distribution and power usage intelligent
devices, to downstream control for factories. By product nature, 40% of the company's
revenue is software-driven. Ranking by the expected revenue CAGR in 2024E-30E, we
expect:
Grid digitalization revenue (23% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 13% CAGR,
supported by growing IT spending by grid companies (this segment mainly provides
products such as asset management software, ERP software to State Grid/Southern
Grid).
Grid automation: flexible transmission & relay protection revenue (9% of firmwide in
2024E) to deliver 12% CAGR, mainly driven by converter valve tendering from the
Direct Current UHV lines, as well as relay protection products to ensure grid
reliability. We expect this segment to deliver strong growth in 2025E/26E at
25%/26% yoy due to full UHV construction and tendering pipelines.
Grid automation: distribution & consumption revenue (14% of firmwide in 2024E) to
deliver 12% CAGR, due to the complex electricity information flow and the
increasing use of smart meters.
Power generation revenue (22% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 9% CAGR, driven
mainly by power generation investment growth and also a low market share of the
company and thus high growth potential.
Grid automation: dispatch revenue (9% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 8% CAGR,
as complex electricity flows from renewable energy integration drive product
upgrades, at a relatively slower growth as product upgrades since 2020 have come
near the end.
Grid automation: substation revenue (14% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 8%
CAGR, supported by added content (SVC/STATCOM) to substation, as well as
smart substation penetration.
Industrial internet revenue (6% of firmwide in 2024E) to deliver 5% CAGR, driven by
industrial application growth.

Likely to maintain leadership in various software/hardware
technologies
Nari Tech is a leader in many product categories: In 2024, Nari Tech had a 70% market
share in digitalization software, ranking No.1; it also held a 53% market share in
digitalization hardware, ranking No.1; it held a 47% market share for UHV converter
valves, ranking as No.1. Within substation tendering, it held a 56%/34%/8% market
share in SVC&STATCOM/protective relay/network system integrator, ranking
No.1/No.1/No.4. For smart meters, Nari Tech held a 5% market share, ranking No.1 in a
very scattered market.
Market share also remained relatively stable over the past few years, reflecting a
consistent competitive landscape and highlighting Nari Tech's leading advantages. We
attribute this stability to the company's strong R&D capabilities, superior product
performance, and robust backing of its largest shareholder, which has solidified its
position in the industry.

Tendering overview and competition landscape of Nari Tech's products
Nari Tech' s ultimate controlling shareholder is the State Grid Electric Power Research
Institute (SGEPRI, or originally established as the Nanjing Automation Research
Institute).
Nari Tech' s parent company, Nari Group, was fully funded and established by SGEPRI
in 1993. In 2001, Nari Group initiated the creation of Nari Tech, incorporating mature
business units from within the group, including the Grid Division (with flagship products
like the OPEN2000 dispatching system), the System Control Division (known for its
substation automation systems), and the Industrial Control Division (which developed
distributed control systems for thermal power plants). Nari Tech was listed on the
A-share market in 2003.

Potential catalysts
China grid investment policy stance typically key catalyst
For upcoming catalysts, we need to closely watch the State Grid's work plans (whether
to further raise capex plan by mid-July 2025 as they did in 2024), the Two Sessions in
March 2025 for energy policy direction, and the release of the 15th Five-Year
Energy/Grid Plan in 2026, which will shape the future of grid investments and renewable
energy policy. We expect further valuation upside to come from AI capex growth news
which may lead to the expansion of Al-related power demand.
Key catalysts in the past mainly revolve around significant policies targeting the grid
segment:
2015 Mar: Deepening the Reform of Electric Power System (Document No. 9) was
issued to establish an open and transparent electricity market system.
2018 Jul: Three-Year Action Plan for Blue Sky Defense was introduced,
emphasizing the need for UHV networks to reduce air pollution and transition to
clean energy sources.
2019 Mar: NEA released policies on electricity IoT, highlighting smart grids, data
sharing, and energy efficiency.
2020 May: New infrastructure initiatives listed UHV transmission as one of the key
focus areas.
2020 Sep: China s pledge to achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 brought further
support for renewable energy and grid modernization.
2021 Jun: NDRC announced that starting from January 2022, new onshore wind and
solar projects would transition to grid-parity pricing instead of subsidies.
2022 Dec: NDRC and NEA jointly released a roadmap to accelerate the
development of a unified electricity market across China.
The two red-shaded boxes in the chart below represent phases of share price decline.
The first decline coincided with a broader market sell-off aligned with the CSI300 index
downturn, while the second can be attributed to renewable energy subsidy phase-out
and concerns about the transition to grid-parity pricing.

Further upside may be driven by Al demand
We expect global data center demand to grow 165% by 2030E compared to 2023, with
its contribution rising from 1%-2% to 3%-4% of global power consumption. This is mainly
due to AI queries consuming up to 10X more power than traditional queries (report link).
Our GS team estimates that US data center demand will more than triple by 2030E,
driven by hyperscalers' capex growth (report link).
Recently, there have been significant progress in China Al and large model space, and
we expect Al to take up a more significant portion of total electricity consumption. With
Doubao's (Bytedance's large model) MAU (monthly active users) rising to 60mn as
of Nov 2024 according to AICPB, securing the No.2 spot globally and daily tokens
reaching 40 trn (announced on the 2024 Volcano Engine Force Conference on Dec 18,
2024), Bytedance is set to embark on intensive AI capex investment in China (news).
Bytedance s leading large model may prompt other customer service platforms (CSPs)
to also expand their capex significantly.
The positive progress in model development and end applications could mark a start to
an Al capex and application era in China, further boosting power demand. We expect
data centers' contribution to total power consumption will rise from 1.6% in 2023 to 5%
in 2030E with AI taking up around 12% on average within data centers.
However, technological advances may increase AI model training efficiency. For
example, DeepSeek-V3, developed by Chinese company Huanfang Quantitative, was
launched on Dec 24, 2024 and is based on its self-developed Mixture of Experts (MoE)
model architecture. The model increased its generation speed significantly vs. its V2.5,
from 20 TPS (transactions per second) to 60 TPS, featuring 671bn parameters and was
trained in approximately two months at a cost of US$5.58mn, utilizing far fewer
computing resources than models developed by larger tech companies. The model only
used 2.8mn hours of GPU compute (one tenth of that used by Llama 3).
Overall, despite the intermittent advances in Al model training efficiency and thus
savings in power consumption, we still believe AI applications are in the early stage in
China, poised for compute and inference growth, with rising power demand from AGI
applications, as well as more energy-consuming terminal charging devices (such as
humanoid robots, etc.) yet to come.

Solid financial performance vs. peers
Income statement
Revenue: We forecast Nari Tech's revenue/net profit to deliver 10%/11% CAGR in
2024-30E, driven by leading segments such as power grid digitalization/power grid
automation delivering 13%/10%. Among power grid automation segments, we believe
relay protection and flexible transmission (UHV)/distribution and consumption segments
will outperform the segment average at 12%/12% CAGR, with relay protection and
flexible transmission maintaining high growth of 25%/26% in 2025E/26E.
Margin: We forecast Nari Tech's gross profit margin (GPM) to stay stable at 28%,
maintaining its out-performance versus most domestic and overseas peers, reflecting a
stable competitive landscape for high-voltage equipment and digitalization products.
Similarly, we expect Nari Tech's EBIT margin to improve from 14.9% in 2024 to 16.2%
in 2030E, supported by the company's effort to lower SG&A expenses. For ROE, we
project Nari Tech to improve from 16.5% in 2024 to 18.3% in 2030E, further
demonstrating its solid financial performance compared to the majority of its domestic
and international peers.

Balance sheet
We forecast cash conversion days for Nari Tech to stabilize at 271 days over 2024-30E,
with receivables/accounts payables/inventory days stable at 187/95/11 days
respectively. Though the cash collection turnover days is long, we don't view this as a
financial risk, due to reliable counterparties (State Grid/South Grid as SOEs) and a low
historical incidence of bad debt.
Cash flow statement
Capex: We forecast Nari Tech's capex spending to be Rmb1.7bn in 2025E, mainly
spent towards production line upgrade, infrastructure and a continued spending for IGBT
module production (they plan to expand the IGBT production capacity from 0.2mn units
to 0.3mn units).
Dividends: Nari Tech's dividend payout in 2023 was 60% (an increase versus 40% in
previous years) and we forecast its dividend payout to stabilize at 50% in 2025-30E.

Valuation
We use a 2025E P/E valuation methodology to derive our 12-month target price for Nari
Tech, in line with our China Industrial Tech coverage. Our target 25X 2025E P/E multiple
is based on a premium to its historical PEG average of 1.7X (against its 11% long-run
EPS CAGR), slightly above the regression lines for our China Industrial Tech coverage
and global GS-covered power equipment companies, and as we expect valuation
expansion to be driven by 1) strong 2025E grid investment; 2) multi-year structural grid
investment ahead driven by intake of renewable energy; 3) expanding AI power demand
potentially. We believe Nari Tech deserves a valuation premium mainly due to its stable
EPS growth and leading shareholder return within our coverage (in 2nd quartile for ROE
at 18.3% and 1st quartile for CROCI at 24.1%). Additionally, 40% of the company s
revenue falls in the category of software and thus we believe the valuation should
resemble those of the industrial software companies (Baosight, Supcon, Bochu, etc.).
Our 12-month target price is Rmb29.0, implying 26% upside.
Nari Tech is currently undervalued compared to its own historical track record as well as
domestic peers. Shares are trading at 20X 12-month forward P/E, vs. its own historical
average of 22.1X and domestic peers' historical average of 28X, and vs overseas
peers' historical average of 39X (or 17X excluding Siemens Energy and GE Vernova).
We think Nari Tech' s valuation could expand based on: 1) strong 2025 State Grid
spending; 2) to a lesser extent, stronger Al data center demand to drive valuation
expansion. Nari Tech is trading at 16X 12-month forward EV/EBITDA, vs. its historical
avg of 18.7X and domestic peers' average of 19.2X, vs overseas peers' average of
12.6X.
We assign an M&A rank of 3 for Nari Tech, due to its large market cap, concentrated
actual controller.

investment in 2025E: We currently expect power grid investment by the State Grid to
stay elevated in 2025E at Rmb690bn, slightly higher than its announced capex plan of
Rmb650bn on Jan 15, 2025. We expect possibly further raised capex or their actual
investment exceeding their announced target, due to renewable energy waiting for grid
capacity. If they do not raise capex target by mid-2025E like they did in 2024, or they do
not exceed their announced capex plan, grid investment will come below our
expectations. We also expect strong fiscal stimulus support, such as the power
equipment large-scale upgrade plan. Also if the financial situation of State Grid
deteriorates, resulting in budget cuts, grid investment may come below our expectations,
directly impacting all Nari Tech's product lines' revenues.
2) UHV project approval pace might fall behind its announced work plan, i.e., under six
projects start construction in 2025: UHV project approvals and construction require
extensive coordination across multiple provinces, involving agreements on land use,
routing, cost-sharing, which can be time-consuming and complex. Additionally, thorough
environmental assessments and potential delays in obtaining necessary permits could
further slow progress, increasing the risk of falling behind our projected construction
starts of six lines in 2025E. Fewer-than-expected UHV projects construction starts will
result in below-expectations revenue recognition for Nari Tech's converter valve
products.

Investment thesis, PTRM
Investment Thesis
Nari Tech is a leading power equipment player in China, holding dominant positions in
UHV converter valves, grid digitalization, dispatch software, automation solutions, and
secondary equipment such as SVC/STATCOM systems and relay protection at
34%-70% market share. We are positive on Nari Tech as a structural beneficiary of the
incremental investment towards China's power grid modernization needs, ensuring a
smarter, more flexible and more reliable grid, particularly as the challenges of integrating
intermittent and volatile renewable energy sources grow. We believe Nari Tech can
deliver solid 10%/11% revenue/net profit CAGR over 2024-30E, outperforming China's
grid investment of 8% CAGR as the company especially benefits from the
structurally-growing areas of grid investment, ultra-high-voltage (UHV) and smart grid.
We expect the company to maintain its leadership in its product portfolio due to its
dominant position in a stable market landscape and relationship with the State Grid. Key
catalysts include State Grid s work plans, the Two Sessions in March 2025 for energy
policy direction, and the release of the 15th Five-Year Energy/Grid Plan in 2026, and
Al-related capex growth news. Nari Tech is currently undervalued compared to its own
historical track record as well as domestic peers. However, we expect the company s
strong financial profile (GPM/OPM at 28%/16% and a leading ROE of 18% expected in
2024-30E) and its software-heavy revenue mix (40% of total 2024E revenue) to support
a valuation premium for Nari Tech among its China industrial tech peers, and hence we
are Buy-rated on Nari Tech.
Price Target Risks & Methodology
Our 12-month target price of Rmb29.0 is based on 25X 2025E P/E. Key risks include: 1)
Lower-than-expected fiscal support and the State Grid announcement for 2025 budget,
2) UHV project approval pace falling behind its announced work plan.

高盛要素概要
高盛要素概要部分通过将一只股票的主要指标与市场（即我们的覆盖范围）和可比同业相比较来评价该股的投资背景。四个主要指标是增长、财务回报、
估值倍数（估值）和综合状况（增长、财务回报、估值倍数的综合情况）。增长、财务回报和估值倍数是运用每只股票具体指标的正常化排名计算。随后
取这些指标正常化排名的均值并转化为相关指标的百分位。每项指标的具体计算方式可能随着财务年度、行业和所属地区的不同而有所变化，但标准方法
如下:
增长指标是基于一只股票的预期销售增速、EBITDA增速和每股盈利增速（金融股仅采用每股盈利和销售增速），较高的百分位表示公司增长较快。财务
回报是基于一只股票的预期净资产回报率、ROCE和CROCI（金融股仅采用净资产回报率）， 较高的百分位表示公司的财务回报较高。估值倍数基于一
只股票的预期市盈率、市净率、股价/股息、EV/EBITDA、EV/FCF、EV/DACF（EV/经债务调整的现金流）（金融股仅采用市盈率、市净率和股价/股
息），较高的百分位表示公司的估值倍数较高。综合状况百分位为增长百分位、财务回报百分位和（100% - 估值倍数百分位）的平均值。
预测的比较（所有指标均使用每股数据）。
如需了解高盛要素概要更具体的计算，请联络您的高盛代表。
并购评分
在我们的全球覆盖范围中，我们使用并购框架来分析股票，综合考虑定性和定量因素（各行业和地区可能会有所不同）以计入某些公司被收购的可能性。
然后我们按照从1到3对公司进行并购评分，其中1分代表公司成为并购标的的概率较高(30%-50%)，2分代表概率为中等(15%-30%)，3分代表概率较低
