What's Different
Integrated projects enrich product structure. The integrated project uses calcium carbide as raw material
to produce 1.4 butanediol (BDO) through the alkyne aldehyde method; Using BDO as raw material, produce
N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) products and polybutylene terephthalate (PBAT) products. The project is designed
to have an annual production capacity of 200000 tons of BDO, 160000 tons of NMP, and 30000 tons of PBAT
biodegradable materials. Some of the devices in the company's integrated project have completed the process
and produced qualified products, entering the trial production stage. According to the feasibility study report,
the estimated total investment for the integrated project is 3.387 billion yuan. The integrated project includes
tons/year NMP products.
\triangleright
Investment and construction of gasification platform upgrade and renovation project. The project aims
to replace the gasification unit based on the unchanged consumption of raw coal. The unit uses coal as raw
material and produces synthetic gas after gasification and purification; The main facilities include gasification
equipment, auxiliary production equipment, and some supporting public works. After the project is completed
and put into operation, the main product production scale is a total synthesis gas of 450900 Nm 3/h (calculated
as Nm3/h based on effective gas CO+H2); The project construction period is 18 months. The estimated total
investment for this project is 3.039 billion yuan, and the project construction funds will be provided by the
company's own funds and bank loans. According to the feasibility study report, it is estimated that the project
will achieve an average annual operating revenue of 3.665 billion yuan after completion and operation
(calculated based on the total external sales of output). However, the synthetic gas produced by this project
is the raw material gas for the company's final product, so the economic benefits will be determined by the
profitability of the final product.
