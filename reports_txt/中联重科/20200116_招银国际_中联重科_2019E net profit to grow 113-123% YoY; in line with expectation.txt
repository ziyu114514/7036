on the back of 13% ROE in 2020E-21E). Strong industry sales data points will
likely serve as near term catalyst. Reiterate BUY.
Stock Data
Key reasons for the earnings growth in 2019E. The strong net profit growth
was driven by strong demand for both crane and concrete machinery, as well
as new products such as the earth working machinery (i.e. excavators) and
aerial working platform (AWP). Besides, oversea business also reported
continuous growth. All these helped Zoomlion achieve above industry average

profit in 4Q19E grew 47% YoY to RMB1.07bn.
■ Upcoming drivers. We maintain our positive stance on Zoomlion in 2020E,
with positive drivers coming from the potential recovery of infrastructure
spending in 1Q20E, resilient property construction activities, acceleration of
the replacement of NES III trucks, strong delivery of large-size tower cranes

and fast-growing new products sales.
Risk factors: (1) Unexpected weakness on property construction activities;
(2) Slow recovery of infrastructure spending; (3) High earnings volatility.
