RMB8.74
3Q20E would surge 64-97% YoY to RMB1.48-1.78bn. The high-end of the range
is above our expectation. We expect Zoomlion's growth will continue to be driven

by both the upcycle of existing products (concrete, crane and agricultural

machinery) and the Company's expansion in new products. Besides, we believe
the subscription of new shares by management team in the upcoming fund-
raising exercise will further enhance market confidence. Maintain BUY with TP of
RMB10.2 (12x 2020E P/E).
