Interim results jumped 53%. Revenue and net profit surged by 19.5% to
RMB71.6bn and 53.3% to RMB10.0bn in 1H19, respectively. The strong results
were driven by increase of delivery GFA and margin improvement. GM for
property development expanded by 5.7ppts to 41.0% in 1H19. As a result, overall
Chengyu Huang
GM and NM improved to 39.8% and 18.2% in 1H19, respectively.
Cash collection of RMB216.8bn in 1H19. Contracted sales amount and area
increased by 17.3% to RMB252.6bn and 12.6% to 16.37mn sq m in 1H19,
respectively. Cash collection ratio was 86% and cash proceeds from contracted
sales amounted to RMB216.8bn in 1H19. So net gearing ratio stayed at healthy
level of 76.6% as at Jun 2019. In Jul, Poly Development achieved contracted
sales of RMB27bn that resulted in 58.3% of hit rate based on our full year
contracted sales forecast of RMB480bn in 2019. Although property market
sentiment becomes cloudy in 2H19, we believe Poly Development would achieve
our sales forecast.

44 projects of 8.26mn sq m land bank for considerations of RMB53.3bn in 1H19.

development were 110.7mn sq m and 76.2mn sq m, respectively. These land
banks were mainly situated at the first and second tier cities or major city clusters.
We estimate NAV to be RMB25.11 per share.
