is sufficient to its next 3-4 years development. Furthermore, cost of debt was 5.03%
in 2018 because of the central SOE status.

Company background
A large scale central SOE
Poly Development is owned by China Poly Group, which is a large scale central state-
owned enterprise (SOE) under the direct supervision and administration of the State-owned
Founded in Feb 1992, China Poly Group obtained the approval from the State Council and

in 2006. It is engaged in the property development business. In 2018, its contracted sales
amounted to RMB404.8bn, up 30.9% YoY. As a result, the Company was ranked as the
fifth largest property company in China, in terms of contracted sales amount, based on
CRIC report. As at Mar 2019, Poly Development was investing in 598 property projects
with total GFA of 230mn sq m.

and indirectly. Lastly, according to HKEx announcement, Poly Development will lead all
new property development projects in China (excluding Hong Kong and Macau).

National footprint
Being the fifth largest property developer in China and having 230mn sq m land bank as at
Mar 2019, Poly Development invests nationally. Headquartered in Guangzhou, Southern
China is the major battle field for Poly Development. Revenue from Southern China
accounted for 39.1% of total revenue in 2018, being the largest geographical contributor.
Eastern China was the second largest contributor, which accounted for 26.0% of total
revenue in 2018. The Company penetrates more than 100 cities in China. Furthermore,
Poly Development had entered the oversea property market, such as in Melbourne, Sydney,
London and Los Angeles.
In 2018, Poly Development newly acquired 132 projects with total GFA of 31.16mn sq m.
per sq m. New projects in the first and second tier cities accounted for 74% and 61% in
terms of acquisition cost and GFA, respectively. Lastly, new start and completion were
43.96mn sq m and 22.17mn sq m in 2018, respectively.

Robust sales growth
Poly Development experienced a steady contracted sales growth from RMB125.3bn in
2013 to RMB404.8bn in 2018, representing a 26.4% CAGR in the corresponding period. In
2018, contracted sales increased by 30.9% to RMB404.8bn, ranking fifth nationally and
first among SOE. In 2019, China property market is facing many uncertainties. But Poly
Development experienced a 21.8% of contracted sales growth to RMB189.0bn in 5M19.
Given RMB650bn saleable resources in 2019, we expect its 2019 full year contracted sales
to be RMB480bn, up 18.6% YoY, or representing a 73.8% sales through rate.

Business diversification
Revenue from property sales amounted to RMB182.5bn in 2018, representing 93.8% of
total revenue. The Company will leverage its brand name and marketing position to
penetrate general property service business and real estate fund.
In Jun 2019, the Company announced its plan of spinning off property management
business and listing on Stock Exchange of Hong Kong. Poly Property Management is
serving properties projects in 131 mainland cities. According to the information from NEEQ,
revenue and net profit of Poly Property Management increased by 30.3% to RMB1,853mn
full year revenue and net profit to be RMB4bn and RMB400mn, respectively.
AUM of Poly Real Estate Fund was RMB100bn. It had invested in more than 150 properties
projects. Real Estate Fund not only improves the balance sheet, but also enhances return
by receiving management fee and performance fee.
Competitive advantage
High efficiency management team
Referring to the military culture, Poly Development was built into a highly efficient
management structure. The Company has a high execution power through the clear
defined responsibility, scientific decision-making mechanism, fair job duty appraisal,
precise internal audit and organization monitoring. Furthermore, Poly Development
implements an attractive incentive scheme with share option and project investment plans
in order to stimulate staff performance. In addition, the Company pays attention to human
resource training to secure a professional and sustainable management team.
Niche strategic position
Founded in 1992, Poly Development surged with the sustainable economic growth and
urbanization. It receives ample harvest and enjoys steady growth by focusing business
development in property market. In the past, contribution from property development
always accounted for more than 90%. Now, the Company further expands business to
general property service and real estate fund. On the one hand, there is synergy as these
new business lines are related to property development business. On the other hand, it can
cultivate new earnings growth drivers.
Focus on major city clusters
Poly Development focuses on the property market in the first and second tier cities as well
as major city clusters, such as those in Pearl River Delta (PRD), Yangtze River Delta,
Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Central China, Western China and West Strait Region. For
optimization, Poly Development would strengthen the business development in the robust
cities. For example, about 60% of GFA under development is located in the first and second
tier cities. Another 30% is situated in the third and fourth tier cities where are adjacent to
the major city clusters. Especially, more than one-third of GFA under development is
located at the PRD. In terms of product design, more than 85% of properties for sales are
sq m that satisfied the demand for first time home buyers or first time upgraders.
Integrated development of property related business
After many years of development, Poly Development established multi channels for land
acquisitions, including tendering, auction, listing, M&A, co-operation, urban renewal
development etc. It had accomplished many urban renewal development projects, theme
parks, landmark buildings, signature towns and industrial parks. All of these projects
enjoyed cost advantages.
Thanks to the strong base in property development business, Poly Development is
participating in upper and lower streams of property industry. For example, the Company
is engaged in the general property servicing and real estate financing industries. It has
strategic development in property management, agent, construction and real estate funds.
Low funding cost
Poly Development strengthened cash management. Cash collection ratio was maintained
at more than 85% in recent years. Taking advantage of central SOE, the Company has
multi financing channels, such as bank borrowing, equity financing, direct debt financing,
asset back securities, etc. As at end of 2018, net gearing ratio was 80.6%. At the same
period of time, cash on hand and short term borrowing were RMB113.4bn and RMB48.8bn,
respectively. It is sufficient to fulfill any short-term financial obligation. Lastly, average
annual funding cost was 5.03% in 2018, which was lower than other major competitors.
Financial analysis
Sales of property accounted for 95%/94%/94% of total revenue in FY16/17/18. The rest of
the revenue includes property related business (construction, decoration, property
management, sales agency, exhibition, hotel etc.) and interest income from financial
business. Driven by property development business, or in specific, increased GFA
recognized and recognized ASP, total revenue grew at 15.6% CAGR from 2014 to 2018.

Source: Company data
Geographically, Poly Development operates its business in 7 regions, including Southern
China, Eastern China, Central China, Western China, Northern China, Northeast China
and overseas regions. Southern China and Eastern China are the two most important
targeted markets, together accounting for 65% of total revenue in FY18.
Revenue recorded a 5.4% decline in FY17. This was mainly due to 40% decline of revenue
from Northern China in FY17. However, revenue from Central China increased 60% during
the period, which largely compensated the decline of Northern China. But ASP in Central
China was lower than that in Southern China. Thus, although overall recognized GFA still
grew in FY17 because of increased GFA recognized from Central China, overall
recognized ASP still dropped from RMB11,652/sq m in FY16 to RMB9,948/sq m in FY17.
Source: Company data
Source: Company data
In FY18, contribution from Southern China and Eastern China increased 5ppt to 65% and
revenue from Northern regained a 43% growth, so recognized ASP rapidly recovered to
RMB12,016/ sq m in FY18.
Looking forward, we expect recognized ASP will be sustainable and follow its growth track
of its leading indicator, contracted ASP. Furthermore, the Company has disclosed its
planned GFA completion in FY19, which increases to 27.50 mn sq m, 24% increase from
22.17mn sq m actual completion in FY18.
Source: Company data
Source: Company data
Ratio of prepayment/recognized is a good revenue indicator. Normally, large ratio indicates
to 1.64 in FY17 and stayed flat in FY18, which indicates strong revenue visibility in the near
term. The Company completed more than 33% its original new start GFA plan to 43.96mn
sq m in FY18 and plans to new start 45.00mn sq m in FY19. We believe these new starts
will provide ample saleable resources for FY19/20 and support the growth of revenue.

Gross margin sustains at 30% level
As 95% of revenue comes from sale of properties, overall gross margin is largely affected
by property development business. Overall gross margin was 29.0%/31.0%/32.5% in
FY16/17/18. And gross margin of sales of properties was 28.0%/30.5%/32.7% in
FY16/17/18. Cost of goods sold mainly includes land cost, construction cost and others.
Land cost and construction together accounts for about 95% of cost of goods sold.

Ratio of land cost to contracted ASP of new acquired land are stable at 40% level. We
believe gross margin of sale of properties will sustain at 30% level in the future. However,
due to price restriction, we do not expect gross margin to significantly improve. Thus, we
forecast gross margin of sale of properties to be 32.5%/32.0%/32.0% in FY19E/20E/21E,
and overall gross margin to be 32.3%/31.8%/31.8% in FY19E/20E/21E.

Taxes & surcharges, sell expenses, admin expenses, and R&D expenses together

expenses to be stable during forecast period, which is 13.3%/13.1%/13.1% in
FY19E/20E/21E. Therefore, EBIT is estimated to be RMB47.9bn/59.2bn/68.3bn in

Net profit attributable to shareholders was RMB12.4bn/15.6bn/18.9bn in FY16/17/18,
respectively, representing net margin of 8.0%/10.7%/9.7%. We forecast net profit
attributable to shareholders to be RMB26.0bn/30.8bn/35.3bn in FY19E/20E/21E,
respectively, representing a CAGR of 23.1% next three years. Net margin, accordingly, is

Net gearing is expected to decrease in FY19 due to cautious move in
land acquisition
Total borrowing was RMB204.7bn by FY18, of which 48.7bn was short term debt. Cash on
hand was RMB113.4bn, which is sufficient to cover the short term debt. Net gearing was
55.2%/86.4%/80.6% by FY16/17/18. In 5M19, Poly Development achieved contracted
sales of RMB189.0bn, up 22% YoY. However, Poly Development has slowed down its
investment in land acquisition. We believe this was mainly because of the Company's
cautious view on current land market, as land premium is rising rapidly in 5M19. Thus, we
expect net gearing ratio to decrease in FY19, as the Company holds a stronger cash
position due to less investment.

Although Poly Development slows down its land acquisition, the Company has already
accumulated ample land bank to sustain the growth. Land bank, including GFA under
construction and for future development, reached 195.44mn sq m by end-FY18, 17.8% or
29.51mn sq m increase from end-FY17. With significant growth of new start area in FY19,
we believe current land bank is sufficient for the next 3-4 years.

Valuation
We estimate EPS of Poly Development to be RMB2.08/2.59/2.98 in FY19E/20E/21E.
Current share price is trading at 6.5/5.3x FY19E/20E P/E, which is below its 5-year average
forward P/E of 7.9x. We select 10 A-Share developers as peers. The peers are trading at
6.2/5.2x FY19E/20E P/E in average. As a leading developer with SOE background and
ample land bank, we believe Poly Development deserves a valuation premium.
With 8.0x 19E P/E, which is peers' mean plus 1 standard deviation and also closed to its
5-year average forward P/E, our target price is derived at RMB16.64, indicating an upside
potential of 29.8%. Initiate with BUY.

Industry analysis
National property sales grew 6.1% in 5M19 but volume declined 1.6%. Although new start
area grew 10% YoY, land acquisition area and accumulated land auction premium reduced
33.2% and 35.6% YoY. Construction expenditure is recovering backed by the large new
start area in 2H18, thus supporting the real estate investment (REI) in the near term.
Market cooling down after Mar/Apr
National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) released China property market data for 5M19.
National property sales grew 6.1% YoY to RMB5.17th but shadowed by 2.0ppt MoM growth
decline (4M19: 8.1%) and 1.6% decline in sales volume. We believe volume decline is
caused by weakening demand in tier 3/4 property market after its rally in 2017 and 2018.
However, completed properties for sale continues to drop for 27 consecutive months since
months. Thus, we do not expect an extensive policy relaxation or any strong stimulus to
property market. But we expect local governments in second tier cities to marginally relax
housing policy in a timely manner to attract population and maintain local market stability.
New start declerates with sluggish land replenishment
New start area grew 10% YoY, while MoM growth slowed down by 2.6ppt in May.
Furthermore, land acquisition area and accumulated land auction premium significantly
reduced 33.2% and 35.6% YoY, respectively. It may reflect the prudent attitude of property
developers and weakening land market in third/fourth tier cities. Land acquisition area is a
leading indicator of new start area. We expect new start area to continue to decelerate.
REI supported by construction expenditure
REI grew 11.2% YoY for 5M19, slightly decelerating from 4M19 (11.9%) but still maintaining
a double-digit growth. So far there is no data on 5M19 land expenditure and construction
expenditure. But for 4M19, land expenditure and construction expenditure grew 29.7% and
5.6% YoY, respectively. For the past 10 months, growth of land expenditure gradually
decelerated which is consistent with land auction premium. However, construction
expenditure or construction area, on the other hand, is recovering backed by the large new
start area in 2H18. Looking forward, we think growth of construction expenditure will offset
the diminishing new start and support the REI in the near term.
Housing price rose steadily in 5M19 but still controllable
Several local governments have already marginally relaxed its housing restriction from the
beginning of 2019 in order to attract population and support local economy. With sufficient
mortgage supply in the beginning of year and declined mortgage rate, housing price in all
tiers of cities rose in 5M19, but in a very slow way. Under current regulation framework of
"One-city-one-policy", local government would quickly react to any significant change of
local property market, especially the housing price.
In the long run, we believe housing price in first tier cities can be supported by population
influx and local industry. Housing price among second tier cities may vary by cities,
depending on local economy and population growth. With the completion of shanty town
redevelopment, some third tier cities may be hard to find a support if new demand is weak.

Major risks
Real estate market downturn
Poly Development's business and prospects depend on the performance of the PRC
property market. Property markets in where the Company has operation are affected by
local, regional, national and global factors, including economic and financial condition,
speculative activities in local markets, demand for and supply of properties, investor
confidence, availability of alternative investment choices for property buyers, inflation,
government policies, interest rates and availability of capital. Any market downturn in China
generally or cities in which Poly Development has or expects to have operations may
materially and adversely affect the Company's business, financial condition and results of
operations.
Unfavorable housing policy
China property business is subject to extensive governmental regulation, and in particular
sensitive to policy changes in the PRC property sector. The PRC Government has
promulgated various control measures in recent years, which aimed at cooling the property
sector, and the government may adopt further measures to regulate this sector. If local
governmental authorities adopt stricter regulation on property market in where Poly
Development has or expects to have operations, it may have an adverse effect on the
Company's business, financial position and results of operations.
Tightened financing condition
Property development usually requires substantial capital investment throughout the
process of project development. Poly Development's property development projects have
been generally funded through cash generated from operations including proceeds from
the pre-sale of its properties, bank loans, corporate bonds, asset-backed securities
programs and other financing arrangements. We expect the Company to continue to fund
its projects through these sources. However, it cannot be ensured that such funds will be
sufficient or any additional financing can be obtained on satisfactory or commercially
reasonable terms, or at all. Meanwhile, the Company may experience negative net cash
flow from its operating activities in the future. A negative net cash flow position for operating
activities could impair the Company's ability to make necessary capital expenditures,
constrain operational flexibility and adversely affect its ability to expand business and
enhance liquidity.
Intense competition from other real estate developers
There are a large number of property developers in the PRC and we expect the level of
competition to increase over time. Intense competition among property developers in China
for land, financing, construction materials and skilled management and human resources
may result in increased cost for land acquisition and construction, an oversupply of
properties available for sale, a decrease in property prices, a slowdown in the rate at which
new property developments are approved or reviewed by the relevant PRC Government
authorities and an increase in administrative costs for hiring or retaining qualified
contractors and personnel. If Poly Development fails to compete effectively, its business
operations and financial condition will suffer.
Substantial level of borrowings
Poly Development maintained a substantial level of borrowings to finance its operations
during FY17 and FY18. As of FY16/17/18, the Company's total outstanding interest-bearing
borrowings amounted to about RMB112.2bn/204.7bn/263.7bn, respectively. Accordingly,
its net gearing ratio, as calculated by dividing total borrowings less cash and bank balances
and restricted cash by total equity, was approximately 55.2%/86.4%/80.6%, respectively,
in FY16/17/18. High indebtedness may increase the Company's vulnerability to adverse
conditions and limit its flexibility in the planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business.
Potential failure on completing projects
The schedules of the Company's project developments and whether a project can be
completed within the planned budgets depend on a number of factors, including the
performance and efficiency of the Company's third-party contractors and its ability to
finance construction and the associated financing costs. Construction delays or failure to
complete the construction of a project according to its planned specifications, schedule and
budget may harm the Company's reputation as a property developer, leading to loss of or
delay in recognizing revenues and lower returns. In addition, if a property project is not
completed on time, the purchasers of pre-sold units may be entitled to compensation for
late delivery or may be able to terminate the pre-sale agreements and claim damages.
