Current Price
YoY and accounting for 55.7% of consensus full-year estimate. 2Q19 PPoP
growth was 20.8% YoY, driven by robust net interest income (+22.0% YoY) and
China Banking Sector
trading gains. Despite prudent provision charge (+23.2% YoY) in 2Q19, earning
growth accelerated to 17.4% YoY, which is likely the highest among nationwide
banks. As a result, 1H19 annualized ROE recovered 0.6ppt YoY to 13.6%. We
Terry Sun, CFA
expect sustainable above-peers earning growth (12-15% in FY19-21E) for PAB,
on the back of resilient NIM and improving asset quality. Reiterate BUY.
■ Results positive: 1) NIM widened by 18bp QoQ to 2.71%, thanks to higher

retail loan yield (+38bp QoQ) and lower cost of funding, esp. interbank
borrowing. PAB further lifted retail loan proportion to 58.8% as of 2Q19, on
faster growth of credit card overdrafts (3.8% QoQ) vs total loan growth (1.5%
QoQ); 2) NPL ratio was down 5bp QoQ to 1.68%, with 1.4% QoQ

Results negative: 2Q19 net fee income declined 5.5% YoY, mainly due to
weaker fees from investment banking and asset custody businesses,
notwithstanding robust growth in settlement and agency fees.
Maintain BUY and RMB 17.0 TP. We expect positive share price reaction
