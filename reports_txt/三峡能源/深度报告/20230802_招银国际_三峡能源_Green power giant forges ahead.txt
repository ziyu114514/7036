CTGR's development history
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates
CTGR's predecessor was the China Water Resources Development Corporation(中国水利
实业开发总公司) , which was established in 1985 and focused on the development of water
conservancy and hydropower projects as well as urban water supply projects.
In 1999, CTGR entered the business of new energy by participating in the shareholding of
Goldwind (a wind turbine manufacturer), and in 2005, it entered the development,
investment, and operation of wind farms. In 2008, CTGR was restructured and merged into
CTG as its wholly-owned subsidiary, responsible for the development and operation of the
Three Gorges Group's new energy business. Since then, the Company has continued to
explore the field of new energy, with the commissioning of its first solar project in 2011 and
first offshore wind project in 2016. In 2018-2021, CTGR completed the three-step strategy
of "introducing strategic investors, stock reform, and listing," entering a new stage of
development.
In 2021, CTGR was listed on the SSE main board with one of the largest IPO in China's

By 2022, China Three Gorges Group (CTG) holds a controlling stake of over 49% in CTGR,
with the actual controlling shareholder being the State-owned Assets Supervision and
vision to become a leading new energy operator. To realize this goal, the Company
formulated a three-step strategy of "introducing strategic investors, stock reform, and
listing."
CTGR's equity structure has undergone two significant changes. In 2018, the Company
introduced eight strategic investors through capital increase and share expansion, which
altered the equity structure from being wholly-owned by CTG to the strategic investor
holding 30% shares. In 2021, the Company was listed on the SSE main board with 30% of
the total shares issued. After the issuance, the CTG directly held 49% of the shares, while
the eight strategic investors held 21% of the shares.
CTGR is the strategic implementation arm of CTG's new energy business.
China Three Gorges Group (CTG) is the controlling shareholder of CTGR and is the world's
largest operator of hydropower, and it is one of the largest clean energy groups of China

Technological innovation in the wind power industry will further reduce the
cost of wind power operation
China's wind power industry is undergoing technological innovation during these years,
and new technologies will further reduce the cost of wind power. Currently, technological
innovation in the wind power industry is mainly focused on three areas: first, advances in
wind turbine technology, including large-scale, high-efficiency, intelligent, and modular
turbines. Additionally, improvements in wind farm operation and maintenance management
technology, including digitization, intelligence, autonomy, and integration; and third,
optimization of wind farm layout and design, including site selection, wind farm layout, wind
farm integration, and multi-energy complementarity.
Policy support for the solar power industry and energy storage
The solar power industry has also received policy support, and policy dividends will drive
rapid development of the solar market. In recent years, the National Energy Administration
issued a notice on solar power generation development, proposing a series of policy
measures, including increasing support for photovoltaic poverty alleviation, promoting the
construction of solar power+ energy storage projects, and accelerating the construction of
photovoltaic poverty alleviation demonstration power stations, providing strong policy
guarantees for the development of the solar power industry.
Overall, the new energy power generation industry in China is in a phase of rapid
development, with abundant resource reserves, strong policy support, continuous
technological improvement, and broad market prospects.
In the future, wind power generation and photovoltaic power generation will continue to be
the main forms of new energy power generation. At the same time, to better promote the
development of new energy power generation, it is also necessary to strengthen grid
construction and research on energy storage technologies, and improve the consumption
capacity and stability of new energy power generation.
Abundant project reserves to support continue growth in
CTGR's electricity generation
CTGR has a large projects reserve and plans to increase wind and solar power by at least
5mn kW annually during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period. The Company aims to achieve
a total installed capacity of 50mn kW with a CAGR of 26%. In 2022, the Company added
over 54mn kW of resources and have abundant project resource reserves. CTGR's mature
development and operation experience, high-quality projects, and wide distribution of
resources give CTGR strong potential for expansion.

Peers comparision and CTGR's competitive advantages
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates
We compared the main layouts of electricity operators in the new energy sector under the
latest "Big Five and Small Noble 4" power generation groups. Based on the data of 2022,
we found that CTGR has several outstanding advantages as follows:
1) In 2022, CTGR's photovoltaic installed capacity was the highest among the
listed peers of "Big Five and Small Noble 4" power generation groups. In the
future, CTGR will continue to focus on developing photovoltaic installations.
The target for the newly-added photovoltaic and wind power installed capacity of CTGR in
2023 is 5,000 MW. Photovoltaic installed capacity will make up the majority of this target,
with a planned ratio of around 6:4 between photovoltaic and wind power. Additionally, the
upstream cost of the photovoltaic industry chain has decreased, which has partially
reduced construction costs and helped to improve the overall IRR of photovoltaic projects.
Therefore, the company's willingness to invest in photovoltaic installations will up, enabling
it to achieve or even exceed the photovoltaic installed capacity targets.
Due to longer procurement cycles, the installations in 1H23 were delayed. It is expected
that new energy installation will accelerate in the 2H23.
In 2022, CTGR's power generation increased significantly, which was due to
the increase in wind and solar power installations and higher-than-national-
average utilization hours.
In 2022, CTGR's power generation increased by 46.2% YoY to 48.35mn MWh, which was
the highest among the peers we listed. The company's power generation in 1H23 is
relatively optimistic. In Jun 2023, CTGR's power generation had increased by 14.71% to
28.09bn kWh. From Jan to May, power generation and utilization hours were slightly higher
than the national average. With the improvement of wind resources, it is expected that wind
power generation will continue to improve.
3) In 2022, CTGR's revenue increased by 45%YoY, and its net profit attributable
to shareholders ranked among the top listed peers of the new energy
electricity operators.
CTGR's revenue increased by 45% YoY in 2022, and its net profit attributable to parent
company was up by 11.07% to RMB 7.155bn. The company's results growth was mainly
due to the commissioning of new projects, an increase in total installed capacity, and an
upward in power generation and grid-connected electricity.
In particular, CTGR's revenue growth rate was among the highest of comparable
companies. Although CTGR's gross profit margin and net margin decreased slightly in 2022,
but the data maintained a leading position among comparable companies. The net profit
attributable to shareholders was also among the highest among listed peers, which was
mainly attributed to the company's good cost control capabilities, technological progress,
and excellent resource acquisition capabilities.
Additionally, we believe that the company can maintain outstanding revenue and net profit,
as well as good gross profit margin and net margin. The related growth can be driven by :1)
CTGR's clear target for new installations in 2023; 2)sufficient approved and reserved
projects; 3) a significant decrease in upstream costs for photovoltaics and wind power; 4)
a great incentive scheme;
CTGR's installation progress in 1H23 was slightly slower and its stock price
has been stagnant, with its valuation partially falling. We expect its new
energy installations to accelerate in 2H23, and the stock price to rebound.
In 2022, CTGR recorded a P/E of 21.7x and a P/B of 1.9x. Its overall valuation was slightly
higher than its peers, and its EPS were lower than those of leading new energy companies
such as China Longyuan and Huaneng Renewables. Therefore, we regard CTGR's profit
and valuation attractiveness as still need to be improved. According to the company's
announcement of Jun 2023, CTGR's progress in 1H23 is slightly slower, and its stock price
has been stagnant, with its valuation partially falling. We expect installations to accelerate
in 2H23, and the stock price to rebound.
CTGR is a leader in offshore wind power generation, with advanced
technology and stable future development.
As one of the earliest central enterprises to develop offshore wind power in China, the
CTGR has nearly 5mn kW of offshore wind power capacity that is already connected to the
grid, ranking first in China. The large-scale development of offshore wind power is a
strategic focus for the company, with advanced technology and experience in this field.
In addition, CTGR has a number of offshore wind power projects in the pipeline and has
received support from the government for the development of offshore wind power. We
believe that CTGR's leadership in offshore wind power generation will be beneficial to its
long-term development.
Lower upstream costs lead to higher IRR of the wind farm
project and solar power project, prompting CTGR's
investment willingness
The wind power industry in China has entered the Grid Parity Era since 2021, leading to a
and fell to the lowest at RMB1,150/kW in Feb 2023, dropping by -73%. Therefore, lower
upstream costs have resulted in an increase in the IRR of wind power projects, making
more projects suitable for investment by CTGR. As a result, CTGR is expected to show a
higher willingness to invest in wind power installation in 2023.
Source: NDRC, CMBIGM estimates
The optimization of the industrial chain in the wind power sector reduces cost and increases
efficiency, which drives the long-term growth in IRR of the onshore wind power project. For
example, if the average tariff (incl-tax) for the project is RMB0.45/kWh, the construction
cost of a 100MW onshore wind power project falls from RMB4,500/kWh to RMB4,000/kWh,
the IRR of the project will increase from 11% to 14.3%. Additionally, if the construction cost
decreases further to RMB3,800/kWh, the IRR will increase to 15.5%.
Source: CMBIGM estimates
As the IRR for wind farm projects increases thanks to lower upstream costs, more projects
will meet CTGR's investment criteria IRR. Therefore, a higher IRR of the wind power project
is likely to boost CTGR Power's investment willingness in newly-added wind power
installations.
For solar farm, given the upstream cost continues to drop, we believe the IRR of wind farm
projects will further boost. Recently, the lowest reported price for solar module components
reached a historical low of RMB1.18/W, according to the latest group procurement. In light
of CTGR's focus on increasing photovoltaic installed capacity in 2023, we believe the
company can easily achieve and exceed its new energy's newly-added installed capacity
targets for 2023. As a result, the new project's IRR of CTGR is expected to further increase.
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates
Lower upstream costs in the short to medium term are expected to benefit the IRR of new
energy projects of CTGR. Continuous technological progress may also create opportunities
for IRR improvement. Otherwise, changes in the non-technical costs of local governments
will need to be monitored to comprehensively measure project's IRR as well.
Additionally, CTGR's accelerated deployment of wind and solar power installed capacity,
as well as active deployment of energy storage, is expected to benefit the stability of wind
and photovoltaic power generation. However, configuring energy storage may increase
construction costs and put some pressure on the project's IRR. Therefore, overall changes
in IRR should be considered comprehensively.
The improvement of power generation and average utilization hours
Due to the rapid increase in wind power and solar installed capacity, China's wind power
and solar power generation have grown significantly. The average utilization hours of grid-
connected wind and solar power equipment showed an overall upward trend, mainly due
to the significant improvement in the wind and solar power curtailment rate.

CTGR's on-grid tariff tend to be stable
Tariff policies change and trend
Tariff of onshore wind power and solar power have remained stable after the on-grid parity,
while local subsidies for offshore wind still exist, but still take time to realize grid parity.
to the present: benchmark pricing (2009-2018), guided pricing (2019-2020), and grid-parity
pricing (2021 onwards). During the benchmark pricing stage, new energy projects received
a fixed electricity price with excess payments above the local coal benchmark price as
subsidies. During the guided pricing stage, on-grid electricity prices were determined by
market competition but could not exceed the guided price in the resource area.
Since 2021, wind and photovoltaic projects in China have been enter the cusp of grid parity,
with the on-grid electricity price set according to the local coal benchmark price. The on-
grid tariff of onshore wind power and solar power tend to be rebound and stable in 2023.
For offshore wind power, the Chinese government has announced the gradual cancellation
of national subsidies for offshore wind power and the implementation of local subsidies,
promoting healthy development and competitiveness of the industry. Although it presents
challenges, the policy provides opportunities for the industry, and offshore wind power is
expected to gradually achieve grid parity in the future.
Source: NEA, NDRC, MoF Policy, Energy Iceberg, BBG, CMBIGM estimates
Grid parity lowers overall electricity prices in 2021, while the tariff tend to be stable
in 2023 as CTGR's mgmt.'s guidance
The downslope in subsidies and the promotion of grid-parity pricing have led to a general
decline in the CTGR's tariff, particularly in solar power. From 2017 to 2022, the Company's
integrated average on-grid tariff had a CAGR of -1.9%. Among them, wind power had an
average CAGR of 2.68%, photovoltaic power had an average CAGR of -9.15%, and
hydropower had a flat average CAGR.
In 2022, CTGR's overall on-grid electricity price (ex-taxes) reached RMB0.5/kWh, an
increase of 0.54%YoY (based on FY22 financial report adjustment from RMB0.4705/W in
/kWh, photovoltaic power decreased by 6.6% YoY to RMB0.50 /kWh, and hydropower
increased by 15.4% YoY on average.
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates
In 2022, CTGR participated in market-oriented electricity transactions in 19 provinces and
regions, with a trading volume of 19.087bn kWh, accounting for 40.58% of the on-grid
electricity transaction volume. The proportion of market electricity sales has increased and
is expected to continue to rise.
Source: Company data, CMBIGM estimates
For new energy's executive tariff, new energy projects have been executing market-
oriented transaction prices with some discount compared to the approved tariff. However,
with the increase of grid parity projects and the emergence of a tight supply-demand
balance in electricity, the discount on tariff has gradually decreased over the years.
Assuming a grid-connected electricity price of RMB0.45/kWh (based on the national
benchmark coal-fired electricity price) for new grid-parity projects, we estimate the CTGR
In 2022, CTGR actively participated in carbon reduction asset, green energy, and green
certificate trading, locking in an additional revenue of over RMB280mn. CTGR signed its
first ten-year green energy trading agreement as well. We believe that the scale of green
energy trading will continue to expand, bringing potential performance growth from the
green energy premium.

Expected improved progress in subsidy disbursement
CTGR's new energy subsidy funds mainly come from special funds and the China central
treasury, with low possibility of being unable to recover. However, the accumulation of
subsidies may pressure the Company's cash flow. If the subsidy receipts accelerate, it will
benefit the Company's financial expense savings and new installed capacity investment.
Incentive mechanism flexibility is expected to enhance business expansion
enthusiasm and attention to market value management
CTGR granted restricted shares at a discount to incentive objects in 2021, with a
performance assessment requirement of achieving a revenue CAGR of at least 15.0%,
16.5%, and 18.0% from 2022 to 2024. While the equity incentive will increase management
expenses, it is expected to enhance business expansion and market value management.

The Company actively explores new energy storage technologies and promotes the
development of energy storage projects. As of the end of 2022, the Company's energy
storage installed capacity totaled 1,824,800 kW, and it has built a number of energy storage
demonstration projects across the country, including the Zhangbei Energy Storage Project
in Hebei Province, the Shenzhen Bantian Energy Storage Project in Guangdong Province,
and the Jiangsu Taixing Comprehensive Energy Storage Demonstration Project.
Overall, the Company's stable operation and accelerated installation capacity expansion in
the renewable energy sector demonstrates its commitment to promoting clean energy and
sustainable development.
Financial analysis and valuation
Better proportion of new energy subsidies to account receivable, expected
further subsidies return will improve company's profit
CTGR provisions impairment of renewable energy subsidies under conservative
assumptions, which affects current profit. Accounts receivable for new energy subsidies
accounts for 92.8% of the total, which show slight improvement. The Company has set
aside RMB 560mn in bad debt reserves for subsidy receivables, which may increase the
Company's net profit and operating cash flow if the subsidies are returned and the bad debt
provision is less than the book balance of the reserve.

Profit forecast key assumptions
Installed capacity: According to the company's guidance, it is expected that the
annual wind and solar power installed capacity will increase by no less than 5mn kW
during the "14th Five-Year Plan" period. Based on the projects of the under-
will reach 31,421MW, 37,421MW, and 44,221mn kW, respectively.
We assume that the utilization hours of onshore wind, photovoltaic, and hydropower
for the CTGR will be 2,065, 1,348, and 4,250 hours in 2023. We assume that the
utilization hours of onshore wind power will increase by 1% YoY in 2024, the
utilization hours of photovoltaic will up by 3% YoY, and the utilization hours of
hydropower will remain unchanged.
(3) Tariff: We calculate the wind and solar power grid tariff for the Company in 2023-
2025 based on the weighted average price of subsidies and trading prices. We
assume that the subsidy policies for wind and solar power will remain stable during
the forecast period, and the proportion of subsidies in the grid price will gradually
decrease. Overall, we assume that the market electricity prices will remain stable
compared with last year.
(4) Cost of generation: We assume that the cost of wind and solar power generation
for the Company will continue to decrease due to technological advancement and
lower upstream costs. For 2023, we estimate that the cost of wind power generation
will decrease by 4% YoY, and the cost of solar power generation will decrease by 6%
YoY.
(5) Revenue growth: We assume that the Company's revenue CAGR will reach 16.8%
during the forecast period, driven by the continuous expansion of installed capacity
and the improvement of grid parity.

We estimate CTGR's net profit attributable to shareholders to be RMB9.7bn, RMB11.79bn,
and RMB14.44bn in 2023, 2024, and 2025, respectively, with EPS of RMB0.34, RMB0.41,
and RMB0.50/share.
Currently, CTGR is trading at 17x FY23E PE, which was lower than its peer China
Longyuan (001289 CH) 22x FY23E PE. For CTGR, its valuation was 22.59x for FY22 PE.
Thus, we regard CTGR's valuation should be re-rated and close to its peer China
Longyuan's valuation as they both are the leading new energy operators with strong
background of state-owned parent company and solid new energy installed capacity.
For CTGR, it has the growth potential in 2023 as follows: 1) speed up new energy
installation as the higher IRR of the projects with lower upstream cost, as we estimated
solar power newly-added capacity will up by 60%YoY to 3000MW and wind power newly-
added installed capacity will up by 21%YoY to 2000MW in 2023; 2) robust on-grid tariff
management capability and active green power trading enable CTGR to stabilize its overall
on-grid tariff and we expected the on-grid tariff of 2023 will reach RMB0.5/W; 3) we also
predicted further lower upstream cost to boost the GPM from 58% in 2022 to 59%,59%,60%
in 2023-25E; 4) continually stable and attractive dividend payout ratio;
Summing up, we assign CTGR with an FY23 target PE of 20x, which close to the
valuation of China Longyuan(001289 CH) 22x for FY23E, and arrive at the target price
of RMB 6.79/ share. Initiate with BUY rating.
