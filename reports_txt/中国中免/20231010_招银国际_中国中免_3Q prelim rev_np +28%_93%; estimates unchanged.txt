Valuation. We maintain our average valuation from 2018 inclusive. In our
view, there is presumably no quick fix to the flattering consumption recovery,
and now we project CTGDF to grow at a more normalised cadence over
2024-25E in tandem with the macro economy. With no major changes to
our earnings forecasts, our revised TP is based on an updated 27.5x (from
previously 29.0x) end-24E P/E which still benchmarks to -1sd below 5-year
average since 2018.
