adverse impact from a strengthening USD (against RMB). This includes

profits for the periods. Our current forecast implies 4Q22E revenue/ net
profits to be RMB17.7bn/2.2bn, with a 37% GPM, barring any unexpected
lockdown for the quarter. For now, we assume Hainan will generate
and CTGDF will share ~80%/~77% of it.
Valuation. Our revised TP is based on an unchanged 45.0x roll-forward
end-23E P/E which still represents 2-year average since 2020.
