Robust growth from duty free sales in
all channels in 1H17-BUY

More details disclosed in the interim result following the preliminary result
Research Analyst
CITS announced its interim report this evening. Although CITS already announced
its preliminary earnings growth of 16.8% yoy to RMB1.29bn and top line growth
of 22.5% yoy to RMB12.6bn a couple of weeks before, we managed to see the
Karen Tang
more detailed drivers behind the earnings growth through its interim result report.
Research Analyst
We believe a 44% top-line growth from its duty free business (retail segment) is
the main driver. In addition, the company also consolidated duty free from Sunrise
in 1H17 with RMB 1.36 billion revenue contribution.
Price/price relative
Key highlight: duty free revenue up by 44% yoy
Duty free business - revenue up by 44% to RMB6.6bn in 1H17 from
RMB4.6bn in 1H16.
Hai tang Bay, revenue grew by 21.3% to RMB3.1bn in 1H17 from
Airports/ports duty free stores, revenue grew by 74% yoy to RMB3.4bn
in 1H17 from RMB2.0bn in 1H16. Investor need to notice that Sunrise
was consolidated in this segment in 1H17. Duty free sales from Sunrise
contributed RMB1.36bn. If we exclude that, on a like for like basis, CITS's
airport/ports duty free growth is c. 6% yoy.
New airports secured in 1H17. Besides secured the airport duty free
business in Beijing T2&T3 and Hong Kong, the company also confirmed in
airports (Kunming, Guangzhou, Tsingdao, Nanjing, Chengdu and Urumqi).
from RMB5.2bn in 1H16. This was mainly due to the increasing domestic
tourism business (yoy growth of 9.1%) and ticket agency (more than
doubled yoy) offset by decreasing inbound and outbound tourism
business (yoy drop of 5.7% and 6.7%).
Valuation and risks
We believe CITS' valuation is very attractive at 22x/19x on our 2017/18 earnings
forecast, as duty-free is a policy-protected and high-barrier-to-entry business in
China. CITS' valuation is lower than average retail/travel peers in A shares. We
derive our RMB 37 TP from a DCF-based valuation (8.1% WACC, 9% cost of
equity, beta of 0.9 and 3.0% TGR, unchanged). Key downside risks include: 1)
unfavorable government policy, 2) e-commerce competition, 3) delay in lifting
shopping quota, and 4) competition from OTAs.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to
specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at https://
