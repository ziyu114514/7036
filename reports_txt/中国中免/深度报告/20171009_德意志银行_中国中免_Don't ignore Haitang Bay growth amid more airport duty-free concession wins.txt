Don't ignore Haitang Bay growth amid
more airport duty-free concession wins
Valuation & Risks
Tallan Zhou
Research Analyst
We recently talked to travel agencies and hotel managers in Haitang Bay in Sanya.
According to their feedback, traffic growth in Haitang Bay was robust from July
to September. We estimate duty-free sales in Haitang Bay could reach as high
Karen Tang
as 50-60% from July to September. While the market seems to be expecting
Research Analyst
1) potential bidding for duty-free businesses at Shanghai Pudong Airport and
approval for a downtown duty-free business in Beijing, we believe CITS's
Haitang Bay duty-free sales may surprise to the upside in 2H17 as domestic travel
momentum to Sanya is strong. In view of the national holiday (golden week),
we expect October duty-free sales to maintain strong momentum. We slightly
to reflect the better-than-expected Haitang Bay duty-free sales. Consequently, we
lift our target price to RMB40, from RMB37 previously.
The new Atlantis Sanya Resort should attract more overnight consumers to
shop in the Haitang Bay duty-free mall
Price/price relative
In the longer term, we believe the strong momentum of Haitang Bay's duty-free
sales growth will prevail. The world's third Atlantis Hotel Resort is scheduled to
open at the beginning of 2018. Atlantis Resort is not only a luxury hotel but also
a water park, located only 2km from the Haitang Bay duty-free shopping mall.
We expect Atlantis to attract an incremental 2-3 million tourists to the Haitang
Bay area; we believe Atlantis' entertainment facilities should encourage tourists to
stay overnight and these tourists will likely be the key traffic driver for the Haitang
Bay duty-free shopping mall.

Catalyst ahead? CITS keeps winning new key airports. What's left?
According to Duty Free Expert news, CITS is the confirmed winner of the
outbound duty free concession (concessionaire rate of 35%) at Guangzhou Baiyun
Intl Airport. To recap, CITS won the bidding for inbound duty free with a 42%
Deutsche Bank AG/Hong Kong
concessionaire rate at the beginning of May 2017. The recent departure duty-
free concession win will make CITS the exclusive duty-free player at Guangzhou
Intl Airport. Since the merger of CITS with ChinaTravel HK Group, we have seen
the new management becoming more aggressive in gaining duty-free market
share at major airports this year. So far, CITS has won the bidding at HK Intl
Airport, Beijing Capital Intl Airport and Guangzhou Baiyun Intl Airport. The duty-
free period of Sunrise Duty Free Group (Shanghai), which operates at Shanghai
Pudong International Airport, will expire at the end of 2018E. This leaves only
Shanghai as the last piece of the pie for CITS to take, which could be a potential
positive catalyst in the near term, in our view.
Valuation and risks
We believe CITS's valuation is very attractive at 22x our 2018 earnings forecast,
as the duty-free business is protected and enjoys barriers to entry in China. CITS’s
implies a forward PER of 25x on our 2018 earnings forecasts. We derive our
TP based on DCF (8.1% WACC, 9% cost of equity, beta of 0.9 and 3.0% TGR,
unchanged). Key downside risks include 1) unfavorable government policy, 2) e-
commerce competition, 3) delays in lifting shopping quota, and 4) competition
from OTAs.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to
specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: ( i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
Unless governing law provides otherwise, all transactions should be executed through the Deutsche Bank entity in the
investor's home jurisdiction. Aside from within this report, important conflict disclosures can also be found at https://
