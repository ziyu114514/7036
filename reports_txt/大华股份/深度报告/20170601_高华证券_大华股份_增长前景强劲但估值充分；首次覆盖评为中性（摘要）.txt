Overseas and solutions business to drive growth, with R&D focus
Global branding and sales network expansion
The surveillance business has a dumbbell-like structure, with sales/marketing network and R&D
on the two ends. Dahua identifies market share as a very important focus point. As of 2016, we
estimate Dahua had 8.5% market share in the domestic market and 2.9% market share in the
overseas market, up from 4.3% and 0.5% in 2011. Currently, overseas revenue accounts for 38%
of the company total, and management expects to increase this to 60%-70% over the next three
to five years. We expect overseas revenue to reach 50% of total revenue in 2019E.
In terms of sales network, Dahua has over 2,000 in-house sales staff for the domestic markets,
covering 280 regions and 3,000 counties in China. Its distribution networks reach further into the
countryside. Dahua classifies its customers into three groups: 1) smart city/safe city; 2) big
enterprise; and 3) SME/retail customers. For city-level projects, Dahua would send in an entire
team to be based in the city, communicating with clients on a daily basis. For big enterprise
customers, Dahua uses in-house sales to cover on a consistent basis. And for SME/retail
customers, the distribution channel is put in play.
For the overseas market, Dahua is transforming itself away from being an OEM to overseas
surveillance product/service providers by: 1) promoting its own-branded products through
distributors; and 2) winning solutions project orders from country/city governments (for example, a
border project in Hungary, a safe city project in Mexico, a police force project in Turkey). There're
over 1,000 in-house salespeople covering overseas markets for Dahua, 100 local salespeople in
North America facing big system integrators. So far Dahua has set up 35 subsidiaries outside
China, and management identifies global expansion to be a very important strategy. Management
is planning to further invest in and expand its global sales network in the future.

Transformation from distribution to solution
Dahua was established in 2001 and started out selling digital control dispatch machines and
DVRs. Over the years, it gradually expanded its product range to front-end cameras, control
center equipment, and software.
For the first 15 years or so in China, Dahua mainly relied on distributors to sell its products.
Starting from 2014, Dahua ventured into the solutions market with the restructuring exercise of its
sales and R&D teams. The result of Dahua's restructuring can be seen in its revenue growth and
margin recovery from 2014 to 2016. In the overseas market, Dahua was initially an OEM for
overseas surveillance brands. In 2014, the company started setting up subsidiaries in overseas
markets and promoting its own branded products. In 2016, Dahua entered into the solutions
market overseas.
Currently, the solutions business already accounts for over 50% of Dahua's revenue in China,
with slower progress in overseas markets. In China, Dahua has been quite active in terms of
2017年5月31日
大华股份 (002236.SZ)
participating in PPP projects, as an inroad into gaining more city-level solutions business. We
believe PPP projects could initially boost Dahua's revenue growth. However, longer-term
profitability and cash flow levels are still uncertain.

Focus on R&D
Dahua positions itself as a technology company, and it is continuously focused on R&D. As of
end 2016, Dahua had 5,321 employees in its R&D department (61% of total), and R&D expense
as a percentage of revenue has consistently increased from 5.8% in 2007 to 10.7% in 2017.
Going forward, management expects R&D expense as a percentage of revenue to stay above
10% at least. Dahua established four research institutes in 2015-2016, focusing on chip, big data,
artificial intelligence, and advanced applications. The surveillance front-end industry has lived
through two waves of technology upgrade previously: (1) from analog camera to IP camera; and
(2) from isolated network structure to connected network structure. Looking forward, we believe
we are at the initial stage of the next wave of upgrade to Al-embedded surveillance products and
systems. We are already seeing the change in the industry; surveillance is evolving from simply
being the eyes of public and private sectors to being the eyes and brains in that it not only
captures videos and images, but also does more and more complex analysis to help with various
business needs. In this new intelligent era, Dahua strives to be the intelligent IoT solutions
provider and service operator with a focus on video.

Revenue
Over the past decade, Dahua's revenue was mainly driven by front-end products, followed by back-end
products. Going forward, we expect front-end products will continue to be the biggest revenue driver as
Dahua continues to gain market share in both domestic and overseas markets.
As of 2016, front-end products accounted for 49% of Dahua's revenue, followed by 33% in back-end products.
In 2017E, we expect revenue growth to accelerate to 35% yoy from 32% yoy in 2016, mainly driven by
Dahua's expanding market share and active participation in PPP projects.
In terms of geographic breakdown, we note that Dahua's revenue contribution from overseas markets
expanded from 9% in 2005 to 38% in 2016. Going forward, management expects overseas revenue to
contribute 60%-70% of the total in three to five years' time. In 2015, due to a higher contribution from the
solutions business, gross margin in the overseas market surpassed gross margin in China. Going forward, we
expect revenue contribution from solutions to continue rising as a percentage of the total.

COGS
Both external and internal factors contributed to Dahua's margin recovery in 2016. Externally,
demand picked up from the latter half of the year, and competition became more rational. Small
players' margin has been compressed to near loss-making levels. Internally, after two years of
restructuring to better fit with the solutions business, we have started to see some results, as
Dahua's domestic solutions business takes up more than half of total China revenue now. Going
forward, we expect Dahua's gross margin will continue to improve before stabilizing at around
39%.
SG&A
As a percentage of revenue, SG&A increased to 27% in 2016 from 21% in 2005 as Dahua moves
from a distribution business model to a solutions model. Going forward, management is planning
to further invest in and expand its global sales network. We expect SG&A as a percentage of
revenue to continue to rise at a steady pace.

Income statement
In 2005-2016, Dahua grew its revenue by 45X from Rmb293mn to Rmb13,329mn, at a
CAGR of 41%, mainly driven by the growth in its front-end product suite, the share of which
increased from 1% of overall revenue in 2006 to 49% in 2016. This is mainly driven by the
rising penetration of surveillance cameras in China, as well as overseas markets. By 2020E,
we expect Dahua's revenue to reach Rmb38,121mn, at a CAGR of 30% from 2016. Front-
end products will still be a big driver of this growth with incremental as well as
upgrade/replacement demand for cameras, and its contribution will increase to 57% by
2020E, based on our estimates.
In 2005-2016, Dahua grew its EPS by 30X from Rmb0.02 to Rmb0.63, or a CAGR of 36%.
We notice that EPS growth lagged Dahua's revenue growth, mainly as a result of declining
gross margins due to competition. By 2020E, we expect Dahua's EPS to reach Rmb1.57, up
by a CAGR of 26% from 2016, slower than the revenue CAGR as a result of rising sales and
marketing spend on overseas expansion. The surveillance industry has been consolidating
with big players such as Dahua gaining market share on a consistent basis. In 2016, gross
margin improved by 0.5ppt after two years of decline, and net margin improved by 0.1ppt
after two years of decline. On the other hand, we note small players' profitability level
continues to deteriorate, with some listed companies turning negative in 2016. As a result,
we believe Dahua's gross margin should continue to improve going forward.
Balance sheet
Dahua has consistently operated at a net cash position over the past decade. As of 2016, its
net cash to EBITDA ratio was 1.1X, implying a strong balance sheet.
ROE was 25% in 2016, an improvement from 2014/2015 post its internal restructuring, and
we expect it to stay relatively stable over the next three years.
and 110 days in 2015, and we expect this to stabilize over the next three years.
Cash flow
Dahua's capex as a percentage of revenue has been in a range of 2%-6% over the past ten
years, and has consistently had positive and growing free cash flow (EBITDA - capex), and
we expect the company to maintain its healthy cash flow over the next three years.
Dahua announced a dividend of Rmb0.10 per share for FY2016, representing a payout ratio
of 16%. The company does not have an explicit dividend policy, and its payout ratio has been
in a range of 10% to 34% over the past eight years. We forecast a 16% payout ratio in
2017E-2019E.

Valuation and stock price drivers
We forecast a 32% revenue CAGR and a 24% earnings CAGR for Dahua in 2016-2019E, driven
by continued market share expansion and stabilizing profitability levels. We apply the 20X
average P/E multiple for Dahua's global and domestic peers in 2018E to Dahua's 2018E EPS to
arrive at a 12-month target price of Rmb19.0, implying 4% upside. All the stocks included have
market caps of more than US$1 bn.
We believe P/E is the most important valuation metric that investors are focused on, and it is in
line with our valuation methodology for the A share tech space.

Introducing M&A framework for Dahua
We have previously examined our Asia Pacific technology coverage using an M&A framework
(see Navigating the noise (6): Introduce M&A framework, update roadmap, July 4, 2016). In the
framework, we examine companies' potential as M&A targets and rank them from 1 to 4 based on
our assessment of three key factors.
Firstly, we look at whether there are any impediments, such as shareholder
structure/preferences, industry regulations/government policies, and takeover defense
strategies that could prevent a transaction from occurring. We then consider four qualitative
factors 1) attractiveness of technology; 2) attractiveness of customers; 3) cost synergy potential;
and 4) other/intangible value, and two quantitative factors: 1) market cap; and 2) valuations.
For companies ranked 1 or 2, we incorporate an M&A component into our target price.
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
We gauge whether there are any impediments to M&A because, if there are, a company is
unlikely to become an M&A target even if it ranks 1 or 2 on qualitative/quantitative criteria.
When assessing potential impediments, we take into consideration:
major shareholder preferences (we assume that shareholders with a 20% or greater
stake have significant influence, or a blocking stake), and take into account: any
potential actions by major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third
party (including whether they would likely be receptive, or if they may be opposed to
selling), or if they have announced a preference to raise their stake in the company;
regulatory and or government policy impediments; and
possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill.
We assign a "No" qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are applicable and
a "Yes" qualification if these considerations do not apply.
Four qualitative assessment criteria
Technology: We look at whether or not a company has attractive technology capable of
generating future value, as well as its technological capabilities and intellectual property
rights. We assign a rank of "4" if its technology is unattractive, "3" if it is moderately
attractive, "2" if it is attractive and "1" if it is very attractive.
Customer base: We look at whether or not a company has an attractive customer base
and product applications. We also take customer retention and end-market exposure
(including sales channels) into account. We assign a rank of "4" if its customer base and
product applications are unattractive, "3" if they are moderately attractive, "2" if they are
attractive and "1" if they are very attractive.
Cost synergies: We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for profit
margin/ yield improvement via acquisition of an M&A target company. We assign a rank
of "4" if there is low possibility of synergies, "3" if there is some possibility, "2" if there is
high possibility, and "1" if there is a very high possibility.
Other: We look at whether or not a target company possesses attractive assets,
including brand strength, outstanding management/employees, and intangible assets.
We assign a rank of "4" if they are unattractive, "3" if they are moderately attractive, "2" if
they are attractive, and "1" if they are very attractive.

Two quantitative assessment criteria
Market cap: We rank the companies in four tiers, as shown below, based on the
assumption that the smaller a company is, the easier it is to acquire. We also take
regional qualities (such as differing market cap ranges between regions) into account.
2) Valuation: We look at whether a target company's three-year average P/E and
EV/DACF are below the industry/peer average for the same period, as we believe
companies trading at a discount to peers are more likely to be acquired.
We assign a rank of "4" if the company appears overvalued relative to its respective
industry peer group, "3" if its valuation is in line with the peer average, "2" if its valuation
is discounted, and "1" if its valuation is significantly discounted. We take into account
differing valuation multiple ranges between the companies depending on their region
and their peers.
Within this framework, we assign an M&A rank of '3' to Dahua.
This is mainly due to its relatively large market cap of US$7,794mn, and shareholding structure
(41% held by founder and Chairman Fu Liguan whose shareholding has been stable over time).
We believe the company is more likely to be an acquirer rather than a target.

Key risks
1. Fluctuation in government/public spending
As government- and public-related projects accounted for over 40% of total domestic
demand in 2016, we see fluctuation risks if there are any policy changes at the central
government level and spending delays at the local government level.
For example, in 2014-2015, demand in government-related projects slowed due to slowing
macroeconomic growth in China. This led to Hikvision's revenue growth slowing down to
36% yoy and 37% yoy in 2014 and 2015, from 53% yoy in 2013. Starting in 2H16, industry
participants have noted a recovery in demand, and this could pose an upside risk to our
forecasts.
2. Competitive intensity
There are over 1,500 surveillance product providers in China. Although Dahua's size is much
larger than the rest, it is still not insulated from pricing competition, especially in the relatively
low-end, standardized distribution channels.
ASP for mature surveillance products generally declines by 6%-7% yoy. However, in periods
of weaker demand, surveillance product providers tend to cut pricing more aggressively in
order to protect market share and maintain revenue growth. On the other hand, products with
technology leadership and limited supply tend to have a high pricing premium initially.
