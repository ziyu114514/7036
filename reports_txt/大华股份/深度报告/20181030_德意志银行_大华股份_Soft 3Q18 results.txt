Soft 3Q18 results

Aiming to be the long-term winner in the technology convergence trend
Research Analyst
Dahua reported weak 3Q18 operating profits (growth deceleration and opex hike)
but EPS was saved by non-op gains (forex gain, etc). Dahua regards the growth
deceleration as a temporary issue (China deleveraging policy and trade war
uncertainties) and reiterates its long-term positive view on the industry. Dahua
believes the convergence trend in AI, 5G and security surveillance technologies
will quickly expand the industry TAM, and that it can capitalize on this trend by
leveraging its total solution products. Reiterating Buy rating.
Soft 3Q18 operating results: top-line miss + rising opex
Dahua reported 3Q18 EPS of CNY0.17 (+4% YoY; -39% QoQ) and operating profit
of CNY167mn (-53% YoY; -75% QoQ) on sales of CNY5.2bn (+23% YoY; - 15%
Price/price relative
QoQ). The sharp operating profit decline stems from 1) softer-than-expected top-
line growth (sales missed Bloomberg consensus by 10%) and 2) an opex hike. The
firm attributes the growth deceleration to the trade war uncertainty (impacting
N. America sales), and the Chinese government's deleveraging policy. Saved by
a non-op gain of CNY273mn (higher forex gain, tax rebate, and reduced asset
write-off expenses), EPS missed expectations slightly, by 2%. Despite sales on the
decline, opex rose 18% QoQ to CNY1.7bn, owing to increased sales/marketing
investments for overseas markets and R&D expenses for total solution products.
4Q18 outlook and other key Q&A
Dahua expects 4Q18 net profit to fall within the range of CNY815mn to
CNY1.17bn. The mid-point of the guidance suggests net profit of CNY993mn
(+106% QoQ; +6% YoY), driven by the seasonal demand. 4Q tends to be the peak
season of the industry. We summarize key Q&As during the investor call as below:
1) Long-term industry outlook and growth drivers? The convergency of AI, 5G and
security surveillance technologies will create many new business opportunities
for Dahua in areas such as smart city, smart home, etc. 2) Threat from new
competitors (Huawei, and Internet giants)? The aforementioned convergence
trend will bring in new competitors as well, but the market will be big enough
for multiple players to grow. In addition, Dahua is one of the few firms that
can provide total solution capabilities (front-end/back-end hardware, software/
algorithm, service and channel), which serve as its core competency. 3) Why
negative cash flows in 3Q18? Prolonged payment terms from some clients and
government projects.

Valuation and risks
We maintain our Buy rating, but reduce our 2018-20 EPS forecasts by 10%-13%
to price in higher opex and slower sales growth assumptions for overseas markets
(negative impacts from trade war). We trim our TP from CNY24.5 to CNY22.5.
Our TP is based on 0.8x PEG, or 20x 2019E EPS. 0.8x PEG, which is in line with
regional peers. Risks: market share loss, weak orders from solution projects, and
forex.
Maintain Buy rating with 12-month forward target price of
CNY22.5

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their

publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the

suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous

and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the
