New capacity on the way, but yet to see meaningful shipments of NMC battery;

Hold
Guoxuan High-Tech, the third-largest battery player in China, aims to double its
+852-2203-5716
capacity by 2020, and even to triple it starting in 2021. The company started with
the LFP (lithium iron phosphate) battery, and it is now trying to ramp up the NMC
(lithium nickel cobalt manganese oxide) battery business. However, meaningful
progress is yet to be seen in the NMC battery, with Guoxuan having only 0.4%
NMC market share by 9M18. We set our target price at 15x 2019E P/E, in line with
the industry average. With 9% upside potential, we maintain our Hold view on
Guoxuan. This report marks the transfer of coverage from James Kan to Sharon
Ding.
Weak 3Q due to lower shipments; keep an eye on NMC battery
Guoxuan recorded RMB4.1bn revenue in 9M2018, achieving only 59% of our
estimate, as a result of weak shipments due to the subsidy cut in the middle
of this year. Gross margin in the first nine months also missed our expectation
by 2ppt, a result of ASP pressure and lower volume. In terms of NMC battery,
management mentioned there is no technical or customer issue, but it is awaiting
massive commercial shipments. The company is yet to prove it can repeat its
success in LFP battery.
Cutting target price to RMB13.3 and maintaining Hold; risks
Despite the company's aggressive capacity expansion plan, we are yet to see
meaningful shipments in NMC battery. We lower our 2018 and 2019 earnings
estimates by 12% and 10%, respectively, to factor in its weaker-than-expected
shipments and ASP pressure. Our target price of RMB13.3 (down from RMB15.58)
is based on a target multiple of 15x 2019E P/E, in line with the battery industry
average; the lower TP reflects a shift from a 15.4x multiple and our lower
estimates. We maintain our Hold rating. Risks include faster or slower capacity
ramp-up and shipments.

Capacity overview - aggressive expansion on the way
According to management, Guoxuan currently has around 10Gwh effective
capacity, of which 70-80% is LFP capacity. Total capacity, including that under
construction, is around 21Gwh and is expected to be ramped up in the next year
or two. The company envisions another 10G in the pipeline, eventually bringing
its capacity to 30Gwh by ~2021. Upcoming capacity will include both LFP and
NMC, with the detailed split dependent on market conditions.
Source: Company info, Deutsche Bank estimate
Global EV capacity is expected to quadruple to about 500Gwh by 2020 compared
to the end of 2017 (see report from our Korea team here). Guoxuan is among the
battery players that are building capacity to capture the secular growth, and has
demonstrated comparable margin to CATL, the No.1 player in China, thanks to
Guoxuan's self-supplied cathode materials.
However, as per the company's schedule, we expect to see Guoxuan's capacity
commencement mostly falling in the second half of each year, thus creating a
larger gap between its estimated sales versus year-end capacity, compared to a
smaller gap for CATL, as the latter's capacity commencement schedule is more
evenly distributed throughout the year.

Yet to see meaningful progress in NMC battery
According to Reali, Guoxuan's NMC installation market share reached only
c.0.4% in the first nine months of this year. Meanwhile, management mentioned
that installation market share is only part of the story because some of the
company's sales volume is not included. It seems to us that Guoxuan is yet to
have meaningful presence in NMC battery space.
According to the company, there is no issue with NMC production or clients, but
it takes time to make commercial sales and it wants to ensure there are no safety
issues.

Our target price of RMB13.3 is based on target multiple at 15x 2019E P/E, which
is in line with the battery industry average. The company is currently trading at
16x/14x 2018/19 DBe EPS, and we believe the valuation is fair. We thus maintain
Hold.

Investment thesis
Outlook
Guoxuan is the third-largest EV lithium battery player in China, with c.5%
EV lithium battery market share in terms of installation by 3Q18. We believe
Guoxuan's aggressive capacity expansion and competitive advantages should
help it to grow market share and make it one of the beneficiaries of the Chinese
government's target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020. However,
battery unit pricing decline and EV subsidy policy change may put pressure on
its margin outlook. In addition, we are yet to see Guoxuan have meaningful entry
into the NMC market. Hold.
Valuation
As Guoxuan has listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO in 2015, we
believe its historical P/E band may not reflect its future outlook. We adopt a 2019E
P/E multiple of 15x for the company, which we believe has factored in its growth
trajectory and is in line with battery manufacturers' average.
Risks
Key industry up/downside risks: 1) significant changes in the Chinese
government's EV subsidy policy; 2) weaker/stronger-than-expected volume
growth in the next three years; 3) quicker/slower-than-expected ASP drop or
quicker/slower-than-expected cost cuts.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the

suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
