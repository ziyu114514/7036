A mixed picture of future growth and
near term margin pressure; Hold
Valuation & Risks
James Kan
Optimistic on the long term outlook despite short term hiccup
Research Analyst
Guoxuan High-tech delivered flat YoY sales revenue and -17% YoY NPAT drop
in 1H17, which was attributed to 1) uninspiring downstream battery demand,
led by EV policy change, 2) batteries contract ASP decline, and 3) upstream raw
material price hike. Extrapolated from the company's 9M17 bottomline guidance,
we believe that margin pressure will likely remain for the coming quarter. In
the long run, Guoxuan is planning to strengthen its market-leading position to
deliver high quality product with scale, and we think the company will still be the
beneficiary of the rising EV tide in China. In our view, the current share price has
largely factored in the expected strong growth in the future; maintain Hold.

1H17 results at the low end of guidance
Guoxuan announced 1H17 results on Aug 30, 2017. The company's total revenue
stayed roughly flat YoY at RMB2.4bn, mainly due to lukewarm downstream
demand from EV bus. In the meantime, NPAT arrived at RMB445mn (down -17%
YoY) in 1H17, representing 36% of FY17 DBe and 43% of market consensus. The
reported bottomline was at the low end of the company guidance of RMB435m.
- RMB535m (-18.5% YoY to 0.3% YoY), mainly on account of raw material price
hike coupled with declining NMC batteries contract ASP.
2017 subsidy scheme putting pressure on battery producers
While the current subsidy scheme favors high quality battery producers in the
long term with capacity acting as the major entry barrier, we believe he short term
impact to the battery industry is inevitable. As a result of EV policy change, China
registered c.269k units of EV in 7M17, or merely 38.5% of market expectation
of 700k units in 2017. Guoxuan, a high quality battery producer, has booked
GPM of 35.7% in 1H17, -11.6ppt YoY decline and lower than company's guidance
of a largely stable GPM. The company also released 9M17 NPAT guidance of
RMB635m – 695m (-13.9% YoY to -5.7% YoY), implying no sign of a significant
turnaround in the near term.
Future growth priced in; maintain Hold on margin uncertainty
We cut our 2017DBe EPS by 12% to factor in 16.5% YoY ASP decline in 2017,
while we have already built in conservative volume assumptions. Though near
term disappointment, Guoxuan will still be a key beneficiary of longer term high
EV growth in China. We maintain Hold rating for Guoxuan on a mix of future high
growth and near term margin pressure. Our target PEx multiple remains at 25x
and set the TP at average EPS of 2017/2018DBe to factor in the further growth
in 2018. Guoxuan's new TP is thus set at RMB31.3, 4.3% downgrade from our
original TP. Major risks include higher-than-expected China EV volume sales and
more-resilient-than-expected ASP trend.
Investment Thesis
Outlook
Guoxuan is the fourth-largest EV lithium battery player in China, with c. 10% EV
lithium battery market share in terms of sales in 2016. We believe Guoxuan's
aggressive capacity expansion and competitive advantages should help it to
grow market share significantly and make it a major beneficiary of the Chinese
government's target to put 5mn EV units on the road by end-2020. However,
subsidy scheme change and new EV policy may put pressure on its margin
outlook. Hold.
Valuation
As Guoxuan has just listed on the A-share market through a reverse IPO, we
believe its historical P/E band may not reflect its high growth and ROE, as the
previous assets of the shell company witnessed limited growth in the past several
years. We maintain a P/E of 25x for the company, inline with adjusted industry
average (excluding the outliers), and we roll forward to average of 2017/2018E
EPS after factoring in the 1H17 results.
Risks
Key Industry up/downside risks: 1) Significant changes in the Chinese
government's new energy subsidy policy 2) Weaker/stronger-than-expected
volume growth in the next three years 3) Quicker/slower-than-expected ASP
drop or slower-than-expected cost cuts Key company downside risk: 1) Quicker/
slower-than-expected ramp-up processing of Hefei third phase and Laixi factories.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed rate instruments (thus receiving these cash flows),
increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus cause a loss.
The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the higher will be the
loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the most common adverse
macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client segmentation, regulation
(including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax policies, currency convertibility
(which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or the liquidation of positions), and settlement issues
related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors to be considered. The sensitivity of fixed income instruments
to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to FX depreciation, or to
specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. It is important to note that the index fixings may -- by
construction -- lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of the
proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed to
a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. It is also important to acknowledge
that funding in a currency that differs from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Naturally,
options on swaps (swaptions) also bear the risks typical to options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including, among others, market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk.
The appropriateness or otherwise of these products for use by investors is dependent on the investors' own circumstances
including their tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities, and as such,
investors should take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the
contents of this publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a
result of the high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater
than the amount of funds initially deposited. Trading in options involves risk and is not suitable for all investors. Prior
to buying or selling an option investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options", at http://
your Deutsche Bank representative for a copy of this important document.
Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; ( ii) the value of currencies may be affected by
numerous market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and
debt markets and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government imposed
exchange controls which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are
affected by the currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
