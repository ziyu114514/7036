力。此外，相比宁德时代公司业务规模教小，国轩高科应会面临更大的产品售价和利润
率下滑压力。因此,我们将公司 2019-2020 年的盈利预测下调 20-30%。

较原先 2018 年盈利指引低超过 30%。由于 OEM 厂商于 6 月 26 日新补贴政策生效前加快
新能源汽车销售，这推动了国轩高科核心新能源汽车电池业务一季度的快速增长，一季度公
司收入同比增长加快至65.3%。但公司一季度毛利率同比下降2.8个百分点至30.0%。公
司节省了部分行政及销售成本。但是，由于融资成本不断增加和有效税率上升，公司一季度
净利同比仅增长 25.2%。
新能源汽车需求增长具不确定性 迭加进一步降价带来利润压力，盈利增
长可见度仍然低
随着政府进一步削减补贴，我们预计 2019 - 2020 年中国的新能源汽车需求增长可见度将偏
低。虽然一季度新能源汽车电池销量同比增长 182.6%, 但这主要是由于 OEM 厂商在新补
贴政策生效前加快销售所致。此外，补贴削减将对动力电池生产商的平均售价和毛利率构成
进一步压力。国轩高科与国内领先的宁德时代相比不具备相同的技术和成本竞争力, 当面临
政府大规模削减补贴及竞争变得激烈时,国轩高科将处于较危险的境地。因此,我们将公司
2019 年收入预测下调 14.2%, 只维持公司 2020 年收入预测。考虑到利润率承受更大压力,
我们将 2019 年和 2020 年公司盈利预测分别下调 33.7%和 24.4%。总体而言,我们预计
2019年和 2020年的盈利分别同比增长 6.9%和 23.8%。
应收账款上涨也需格外注意
2018年底,公司应收账款占 2018年总收入 123%, 2017年底这个比重为 91%, 2016年
底这个比重为 57%。应收账款周转天数也从 2017 年的 268 天增加至 2018 年的 382 天,
2016 年为 175 天。2016 年和 2017 年的经营现金流量仍然为负。经营现金流出从 2017 年
的人民币 1 亿元增加至 2018 年的人民币 15.59 亿元。虽然 2019 年一季度经营现金流显示
出改善迹象, 但对于全年经营现金流量情况, 我们仍需观望。
