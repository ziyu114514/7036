SG Micro: No. 2 player in China's analog device market
Founded in 2007 and based in Beijing, SG Micro specializes in analog IC design and sales. It has
two main product lines: PMIC (power management IC) and signal chain, which are widely used in
cell phones, TVs, digital cameras, computers, consumer electronics, automobile electronics,
industrial automation, and IoT devices (e.g., sharing bikes). SG Micro has a diversified portfolio of
over 1,000 products and over 2,000 customers. It competes mostly with global peers such as TI,
ADI, and Maxim.
We are positive on SG Micro's growth outlook for the following four reasons.
Compared with its overseas peers, SG Micro has many local customers to provide
superior service and time-to-market design, enjoys abundant supply of junior engineers,
and has a high valuation level in the A-share market to facilitate its potential acquisition
of small local companies and attract talent.
Analog is a fragmented market where smaller players can take share and remain
profitable. Richtek and Silergy are such examples. For more on China's semiconductor
design industry, see our report: Design and Conquer – in both new and traditional
markets; Buy SG Micro, published on November 13, 2017. While SG Micro has less than
1% market share in PMIC and signal chains, it delivered a net income CAGR of 14.5%
over 2012-2016. We expect SG Micro to continue the growth with a CAGR of 27% in
2017E-2021E driven by increased production and margin improvement from new
products launches.
SG Micro offers a relatively more differentiated technology and product portfolio than its
Chinese peers. It leads in low power, high current, and high precision analog design.
While most Chinese companies focus on PMIC, SG Micro has a niche position in signal
chain products. The revenue breakup between PMIC and signal chain products is 57%
and 43% as of 1H17, respectively.
The Chairman and CEO of SG Micro, Dr. Zhang Shilong, has a track record in analog
R&D over the past 20 years. He has previously worked as an engineer in top analog
firms in the US, including Burr-Brown and TI, and was also recruited by the Chinese
government through “the Thousand Talents Plan” (the Recruitment Program of Global
Experts by China). To maintain its technology advantage over peers, we believe a low
attrition rate of employees, especially senior engineers is critical in an analog
semiconductor industry. SG Micro has had a very low employee turnover rate of below
5% since inception in 2007, which we believe is partially attributed to competitive salary
package and the relatively generous employee stock compensation. As of 3Q17, 7% of
total shares are owned by employees while 46% is owned by Dr. Zhang and
shareholders acting in concert. We think having an experienced leader at the head of an
experienced and stable team should stand SG Micro in good stead to gain analog
market share from global competitors like TI, ADI and Maxim.
Our 12-month target price of Rmb 116 is based on long-term discounted P/E of 40X, derived from
EPS and discounted back to 2018E using a peer average COE of 11.3%, implying a 2018E P/E
average of 40X. We note that analog stocks often enjoy a valuation premium over other
semiconductor companies due to analog's diversified product and customer bases. For example,
in the US, analog stocks have over 30% higher 2018E P/E and 600bps lower growth rate than
other semiconductor design (Exhibit 3). Hence, SG Micro's valuation premium over other A-share
semiconductor stocks is justified in our view. We believe the stock will trade further up to our
implied target multiple of 57X 2018E P/E given its diversified portfolio, improving product mix with
higher margins and continually increasing market share while retaining its technological
advantage.
2017年11月13日
圣邦股份 (300661.SZ)
We initiate SG Micro with a Buy rating and upside potential of 23%.
Note: ADI's EPS CAGR is not included as growth is distorted by its acquisition of Linear Technology in 2017.
Key risks to our view include:
1) Intensified competition among Chinese analog companies: We are aware of several
sizable Chinese analog names, and while the market is fragmented, we view the potential
increase in competition as a key risk.
2) Delay in new products launch: SG Micro's new products should have higher gross margin, if
the launch delays or sell-through is below our expectations, the margin recovery road (to global
peers' average level) will be challenging.
3) Supply chain management risk: TSMC provides 99% of wafer supply to SG Micro, and SG
Micro's new products with better cost structure will also rely on TSMC's advanced technology.
Although SG Micro is actively looking to cooperate with other suppliers, any capacity issue from
TSMC could potentially cause problems for the company's normal operation given the high
reliance on wafer supply from TSMC.

Product overview: A diversified portfolio of PMIC and signal chains
SG Micro has two main product lines, namely PMIC and signal chains, representing 60% and
40% of its total revenues in 1H17E, respectively. The company has a diversified portfolio of over
1,000 products. According to Gartner, PMIC had US$10.2bn TAM in 2016, similar to signal chain
TAM of US$10.3bn, but signal chain products tend to have a longer life cycle and more stable
margins. Often, a young analog company can ramp up a PMIC business faster than a signal
chain business. SG Micro has accumulated technology and new designs in its PMIC business in
the past two years and expects its PMIC business growth to surpass that of signal chain in 2017-
2019. The company expects its revenue mix of PMIC to increase to 70% in 2018 from 60% in
1H17.

Diversified customer base and limited direct competition in China
SG Micro sells most of its products through distributors to over 2,000 diversified end-customers; it
sells directly only to ZTE. SG Micro's distributor partners are well known in China and include
Beigaozhi, Colorbeam, Linpo, Kei Kong, etc. The top-five distributors contribute around 62% of
revenue. While SG Micro works directly with end-customers for design-in, its distributors fill the
orders and handle logistics.
The smartphone sector represents 40% of SG Micro's total revenues today, but it is aiming for the
smartphones, consumer, and auto/industrials/medicals sectors to represent around 30% each in
the near future.
SG Micro sources 99% of its wafers from TSMC, the world's leading foundry, and relies on JCET,
TongFu, and Unisem for packaging and testing.
Exhibit 5: SG Micro has a wide range of distributors and customers

In analog, SG Micro competes mostly with overseas companies (such as TI, ADI, and Maxim); it
competes with Silergy in the standard DC/DC converter market. Its gross margins are lower than
most of its peers due to its new entrant status in the China market and lack of cost advantages.
Chinese analog companies, Silergy, SG Micro, and FineMade are fabless design companies that
purchase wafers as well as packaging and testing services, which are more expensive than
internal productions at most overseas IDM (integrated design manufacturing) peers. Despite its
high-margin signal chain products, SG Micro has lower margins than Silergy because Silergy has
a proprietary wafer manufacturing process that can reduce PMIC wafer cost by 20% relative to
TSMC's generic process. However, SG Micro has said that TSMC has recently launched an
180nm analog process that offers a similar cost structure as Silergy's in-house process; we
expect the cost structure to improve over the next two years, assuming Silergy's cost structure
remains in a steady state. In addition, SG Micro indicated that its new products tend to have
higher margins so that, as its new product increases in the mix, its margin should improve
gradually into 2018 and 2019. We expect around 100bps improvement in gross margins through
2019E (vs 3Q17).

Earnings analysis: EPS CAGR of 27% in 2017E-2020E
Revenue and profitability: Given its lower R&D intensity and improving product mix, we expect
SG Micro's revenue growth to accelerate to 26% in 2018 from 17% yoy in 2017E, and achieve a
23% CAGR in 2017E-2021E, below Silergy's organic growth CAGR of 50% when it was operating
in a similar scale in 2013-2015. In 2013-15, Silergy benefited from the rapid growth of the SSD
module business mainly driven by the company's focus on PMIC that has a large TAM and a
quick ramp-up with the right end-application. Looking forward, SG Micro plans to drive its growth
through PMIC design-in for IoT, innovative devices (e.g., sharing bikes and Segway) and battery.
SG Micro's GPM increased to 45% in 1H17 due to a temporary reduction of low-margin
smartphone business in the portfolio mix, but returned to 41% in 3Q17. The company expects its
GPM to improve gradually as the mix of new products increases in the portfolio through 2018E-
2021E. We expect its GPM to improve by 2ppt to 43% in 2021E from 41% 2018E and help drive
its EPS growth at 27% CAGR in 2017E-2020E.

We expect SG Micro's OPEX as a % of revenue to stay stable at c.23% in 2017E-2021E given its
aim to continuously expand its product lines to narrow the gap with global leader TI, and its net
margin to improve to 19.9% in 2021E from 17.6% in 2017E driven by GPM improvement and
better net interest income. We expect SG Micro's ROE to improve moderately to 18.7% in 2021E,
from 14.9% in 2018E, driven by continuous market share gains and net margin recovery.
Balance sheet: SG Micro has a strong balance sheet. It has a very short cash conversion cycle
which averaged at 20 days in 2014-2016, below that of Silergy and On Bright at 92 and 107 days,
respectively. SG Micro's inventory days were shorter (average of 90 days vs. 103 and 95 days at
days at Silergy and On Bright). We attribute SG Micro's short cash conversion to its superior
supply chain management at its packaging partners and expect its cash conversion cycle to
remain healthy. Although our earnings model does not factor in any potential M&A in the future,
we believe that the strong net cash position of over Rmb800mn by 2021E could potentially
provide solid support for SG Micro to acquire small and private Chinese analog houses of good
quality (in our discussion with SG Micro management, the company indicated its interest in this
approach as a potential future strategy).
Capex: We also believe SG Micro will maintain its capex at a low level as it has done in the past
given the nature of the fabless analog business model where the focus is on OPEX. We also note
that the company has also not indicated any capex plans or initiatives in the near future. We
2017年11月13日
圣邦股份 (300661.SZ)
forecast SG Micro's capex to sales ratio to stay at around 2% and free cash flow to grow at a
CAGR of 25% in 2017E-2021E.
Dividends: We also assume a dividend payout ratio of 10% in 2017E-2019E, in line with the
management's guidance (there is no past comparison as the company was only listed this year).
Leverage/debt: SG Micro has zero debt as of 3Q17. While we do not rule out the possibility of
the company levering up in the short to medium term, we believe SG Micro has limited
requirement of raising funds in the next few years given the abundant cash at hand.

Analog firm trading at a premium; expect further rerating
We initiate SG Micro with a Buy rating and a 12-month target price of Rmb116. We value our A-
share China fabless companies using a long-term discounted P/E methodology in order to
capture long-term growth. For SG Micro, we apply its A-share peers' average 2018E P/E of 40X
to 2021E EPS and discount it back to 2018 using a peer average cost of equity of 11.3%, as
shown in Exhibit 12. Our target price of Rmb116 implies a 2018E P/E of 57X and 23% upside
potential.
average of 40X. We note that analog stocks often enjoy a valuation premium over other
semiconductor companies due to analog's diversified product and customer bases. For example,
in the United States, analog stocks are trading at a 30% premium to the average 2018E P/E for
other semiconductor design firms while posting a growth rate that is 600 bps lower (Exhibit 3).
Hence, we believe SG Micro's valuation premium over other A-share semiconductor stocks is
justified.
We believe our implied 2018E P/E of 57X should be achievable in the next 12 months based on
the following reasons:
We expect its new PMIC products with higher ASP to boost the earnings growth from
2017 after significant investment in R&D since 2015; the company is shifting its business
toward new applications with high margins, such as automobiles, medical equipment,
industrial controls, and IoT from its current high exposure to smartphone (40%-45% of
total revenues).
As one of China's leading analog brands, SG Micro benefits from the trend of adopting
"Made in China" products by customers like Huawei and ZTE, which we believe will help
it gain market share from global competitors (namely TI, ADI and Maxim).
We believe the company can maintain its technology advantage given its strong design
team. SG Micro continues to attract top engineers by offering competitive pay package
and has a low turnover rate (below 5% since inception in 2007). A stable team is crucial
for an analog company compared to a logic design house; analog design houses require
more years of apprenticeship before a new analog professional can become productive.

Introducing M&A rank for SG Micro
Across our global coverage, we examine stocks using an M&A framework, considering both
qualitative factors and quantitative factors (which may vary across sectors and regions) to
incorporate the potential that certain companies could be acquired. We then assign an M&A rank
as a means of scoring companies under our rated coverage from 1 to 3, with 1 representing high
(30%-50%) probability of the company becoming an acquisition target, 2 representing medium
(15%-30%) probability and 3 representing low (0%-15%) probability. For companies ranked 1 or 2,
in line with our standard departmental guidelines we incorporate an M&A component into our
target price. M&A rank of 3 is considered immaterial and therefore does not factor into our price
target, and may or may not be discussed in research.
In the Asia technology sector, we examine companies' potential as M&A targets based on the
assessment of (1) impediments, such as shareholder structure/preferences, industry
regulations/government policies, and takeover defense that could prevent a transaction from
occurring, (2) qualitative factors, including: (i) attractiveness of technology, (ii) attractiveness of
customers, (iii) cost synergy potential, (iv) other/intangible value; and (3) quantitative factors,
including (i) market cap, and (ii) valuations. For details of our Asia technology M&A framework,
see our report Pan Asia: Technology: Navigating the noise (6): Introduce M&A framework, update
roadmap, dated July 4, 2016 for details.
Shareholder structure and potential impediments
We gauge whether there are any impediments to M&A, because if there are, a company is
unlikely to become an M&A target even if it ranks 1 or 2 on qualitative/quantitative criteria.
When assessing potential impediments we take into consideration:
(1) Major shareholder preferences: We assume that shareholders with a 20% or greater stake
have a significant influence, or a blocking stake, and take into account any potential actions by
major shareholders in the event of a possible acquisition by a third party (hostile or otherwise), or
if they have announced a preference to raise their stake in the company;
(2) Regulatory and or government policy impediments; and
(3) Possible takeover defense measures such as a poison pill.
We assign a "No" qualification if one or more of the three considerations above are applicable and
a "Yes" qualification if these considerations do not apply.
Qualitative assessment criteria
1) Technology: We look at whether or not a company has attractive technology capable of
generating future value, as well as its technological capabilities and intellectual property rights.
We assign a rank of "3" if its technology is unattractive or moderately attractive, "2" if it is
attractive and "1" if it is very attractive.
2) Customer base: We look at whether or not a company has an attractive customer base and
product applications. We also take customer retention and end-market exposure (including sales
channels) into account. We assign a rank of "3" if its customer base and product applications are
unattractive or moderately attractive, "2" if they are attractive and "1" if they are very attractive.
Cost synergies: We look at prospects for growth in business scale and scope for profit margin/
yield improvement via acquisition of an M&A target company. We assign a rank of "3" if there is
low or some possibility of synergies, "2" if there is high possibility, and "1" if there is very high
possibility.
2017年11月13日
圣邦股份 (300661.SZ)
4) Other: We look at whether or not a target company possesses attractive assets, including
brand strength, outstanding management/employees, and intangible assets. We assign a rank of
"3" if they are unattractive or moderately attractive, "2" if they are attractive, and "1" if they are
very attractive.
Quantitative assessment criteria
1) Market cap: We rank the companies in four tiers based on the assumption that the smaller a
company is, the easier it is to acquire. We also take regional qualities (such as differing market
cap ranges between regions) into account.
Valuation: We look at whether a target company's three-year average P/E and EV/DACF are
below the industry/peer average for the same period, as we believe companies trading at a
discount to peers are more likely to be acquired.
We assign a rank of "3" if the company appears overvalued relative to its respective industry peer
group or largely in line with the peer average, "2" if its valuation is discounted, and "1" if its
valuation is significantly discounted. We take into account differing valuation multiple ranges
between the companies depending on their region and their peers.
Within this framework, we assign an M&A rank of '3' to SG Micro
Our M&A rank of '3' for SG Micro mainly reflects its protective shareholding structure (nearly 46%
held by Chairman Mr. Zhang Shilong and other shareholders acting in concert). Moreover,
as Mr. Zhang has laid out a very long-term vision/plan for the company, we believe he is likely to
retain a controlling stake as long as possible. Also, we believe the company is more likely to be
an acquirer rather than a target as the former would be a good way to quickly expand product
lines to compete with global peers, and the company also indicated that it could consider
acquisitions as a strategy.

Key risks to our investment thesis
We identify the following downside risks:
1) Intensified competition among Chinese analog companies: We are aware of several
sizable Chinese analog names, and although the market is fragmented, we view the potential
increase competition will be the key risk. For example, Silergy is the Chinese leader and focuses
on DC/DC PMICs; On Bright focuses on AC/DC PMIC; 3PEAK strives to develop high-end signal-
chain products; FineMade makes PMICs for LED and battery applications, etc. Thus, if Silergy (or
other companies that are currently focusing on PMICs) also start to produce signal chain products,
we believe the competition may intensify.
2) Delay in new products launch: SG Micro's new products should have higher gross margin, if
the launch delays or sell-through is below our expectations, the margin recovery (to global peers'
average level) road will be challenging.
3) Supply chain management risk: TSMC provides 99% of wafer supply to SG Micro, and SG
Micro's new products with better cost structure will also rely on TSMC's advanced technology.
Although SG Micro is actively looking to cooperate with other suppliers, any capacity issue from
TSMC could potentially cause problems for the company's normal operation given the high
reliance on wafer supply from TSMC.
4) Greater than expected employee turnover: High-level engineers and engineer managers
are very sought after in China. Any slowdown in the growth of the company and decline in
employee stock compensation can potentially negatively impact the employee turnover especially
among senior engineers.
