2Q24 mid-point NPM is 25.5% vs. 19.2%/26.5% in 1Q24/2Q23. The company
attributed the growth to 1) its broad coverage of semiconductor equipment (etching,
deposition, cleanser, etc.), 2) increasing market share, 3) economies of scale

gradually showing, and 4) improving operational efficiency and stable decrease in
expense ratio. Maintain BUY with an unchanged TP at RMB405.

of our 2024 full-year
estimates
(Rev./NP:
accounted for
RMB30.9bn/RMB5.5bn), or 41%/51% of Bloomberg consensus estimates
(Rev./NP: RMB30.0bn/RMB5.4bn). Revenue seasonality remains consistent,
with mid-point 1H24 revenue representing 40% of that of FY24E (RMB30.9bn,
per our forecast), similar to 1H23 (38% of FY23 revenue). This historical pattern
suggests the potential for strong sequential growth in 3Q-4Q24E, in our view.
Looking forward to 2H24, we expect the pace of semi supply chain
localization in China to remain steady. Naura signed new equipment orders
exceeding RMB30bn in 2023, with over 70% related to semiconductor
manufacturing tools. We expect Naura to deliver robust revenue growth on capex
expansion from downstream clients (including memory and foundry) and the
semi localization trend. In addition, we believe the company could be one of the
beneficiaries amid the recently launched "Big Fund III" (US$47.5bn) in China.
We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura, with an unchanged TP at RMB405,
