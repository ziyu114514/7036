domestic semiconductor equipment (up 47.0% YoY in 9M24) due to China's

investors but have not been announced yet (2024 bookings were
announced in Jan, 2024). We maintain our sales growth forecasts for
2024/25E at 39.7%/26.5% YoY.

equipment sales. We revise down our 2024/25E GPM forecast by
1.3ppts/1.1ppts to reflect the seasonality trend in 2024/25E, but we expect
GPM to continue its upward trend (43.7%/44.3%) in 2024/25E on a
favourable product mix. We slightly lower our NP forecasts by 3%/4% in
24/25E considering continued investments in R&D.
Share Performance
Maintain BUY with TP adjusted to RMB426, based on 30x rollover
2025E P/E, close to its historical 2-year forward P/E. New TP also reflects
1.0x PEG. Potential risks include 1) worsening China-US trade relations, 2)
heightened geopolitical tensions, 3) slower-than-expected R&D.
