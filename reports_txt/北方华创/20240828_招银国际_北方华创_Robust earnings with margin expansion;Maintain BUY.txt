our FY24E forecast, consistent with the company's historical seasonality, which
China Semiconductors
saw 38%/46% in 1H23. GPM improved to 45.5% in 1H24 (vs. 42%/41% in
1H23/FY23), while NPM expanded to 22.5% in 1H24 from 17.7% in FY23. We
Lily YANG, Ph.D
think Naura's 1H24 results confirm that the company's growth trajectory remains
intact. Looking forward, we expect Naura to 1) ride the tailwinds of
semiconductor localization trend, 2) grow on product coverage expansion and

market share gains, and 3) benefit from economies of scale and improving
GPM. Reiterate BUY with TP unchanged at RMB405.
Stock Data
revenue/NP increased by 42.2%/37.0% YoY (vs. 38%/120% YoY in 2Q23)
and 10.5%/46.8% QoQ. We maintain our previous revenue projection for
2024/25E, given the in-line results. The company's 1H24 semiconductor
equipment revenue increased by 55.1% YoY, making up 92% of total
revenue (vs. 87% in 1H23). We believe that escalating geopolitical tensions,
coupled with the push for faster domestication of semiconductor equipment
and favorable policies/subsidies, have contributed to the company's
enhanced revenue in 1H24. We expect the equipment segment to grow
45.9%/28.5% YoY in 2024/25E, and maintain our total revenue projection

Share Performance
growth.
Better-than-expected GPM expansion, driven by favourable product
mix and economies of scale. 2Q GPM was 47.4%, up 4.0ppt sequentially.
We revised up our 2024/25E GPM forecasts by 5.2ppt/3.9ppt, as we believe

Naura will continue to benefit from these tailwinds and maintain GPM at a
similar level. We revised up our 2024/25E NP forecasts by 9%/1%, on
higher GPM estimates. The accretive impact will be partially offset by higher
R&D and other operating expenses, since Naura's priority is to expand its
product coverage.
We reiterate our BUY rating for Naura, with an unchanged TP at
RMB405. The TP implies a valuation at 35.77x 2024E P/E, close to 1SD
above 2-year historical average forward P/E, which we think is justified

considering Naura's leading position in domestic semiconductor equipment
market. Naura is our favourite pick under the semiconductor localization
theme. Risks: 1) intensified competition from overseas and domestic peers
and 2) escalating geopolitical tensions.
