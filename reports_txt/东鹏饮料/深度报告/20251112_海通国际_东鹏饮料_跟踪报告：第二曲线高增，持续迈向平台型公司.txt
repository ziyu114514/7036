维持优于大市
English Summary
High Profit Growth Meets Expectations, Driven Significantly by Non-Recurring Items. In 25Q1-Q3, the company achieved a revenue
of 16.844 billion yuan, representing a year-on-year (YoY) increase of 34.1%. Its net profit attributable to shareholders reached
3.761 billion yuan, with a YoY growth of 38.9%, maintaining a continuous high performance growth. For the single quarter of 25Q3,
the revenue stood at 6.107 billion yuan, up 30.4% YoY; the net profit attributable to shareholders was 1.386 billion yuan, rising
slowed down to 32.74%, indicating a relatively stable growth rate of core profits.
Core Categories Face Pressure and Slowdown, New Products Drive High Growth. In 25Q3, the revenue from the core category of
energy drinks was 4.2 billion yuan, with a mere YoY increase of 15.1%, showing a significant growth slowdown. Geographically, in
25Q1, the revenue growth rate of Guangdong, the company's home base, dropped to 2.1% YoY, and the growth of the mature
South China region slowed down. In contrast, emerging markets such as North China, East China, and Southwest China achieved
high YoY revenue growth of over 30%. As a leader in functional drinks, the company has accelerated the enrichment of its product
portfolio in recent years to reduce reliance on a single core product. In 2025 Q1-Q3, the new electrolyte drink product "Dongpeng
Busui La" achieved a revenue of 2.847 billion yuan, accounting for 16.9% of the total revenue, a YoY increase of 7.2 percentage
points. The company also launched new product categories such as the low-sugar tea drink "Dongpeng Guo Zhi Cha". In 25Q1-Q3,
the total revenue from other categories reached 1.424 billion yuan, with its proportion increasing to 8.5%. Although the gross
profit margin of new products is relatively low, and the change in product structure has exerted marginal pressure on the overall
gross profit margin to a certain extent, the successful launch and growth of these new products have injected a new growth engine
into the company.
Gross Profit Margin Declines Slightly, but Expense Control is Effective with Obvious Operating Leverage. In 25Q3, the company's
gross profit margin was 45.2%, a YoY decrease of 0.6 percentage points. The decline in raw material prices brought certain cost
dividends, but the increasing proportion of new products also had an impact on the gross profit margin level. Meanwhile, the sales
expense ratio was significantly optimized, and the operating leverage was obvious. The early deployment of freezers led to a YoY
decrease of approximately 2.6% in the sales expense ratio in Q3, and the net profit margin rose to 22.7%, an increase of 1.8% YoY.
The company has continuously invested in supply chain construction, having built 9 major production bases. The gradual
commissioning of new bases has significantly improved the regional supply efficiency. The economies of scale combined with
refined operations have enabled the company's gross profit margin and net profit margin to increase steadily, and the optimized
expense control has further enhanced its profitability.
Long-Term Logic Remains Clear, Channel Expansion Continues to Deliver Results. The company will continue to promote its multi-
category, national, and global strategies. While the growth rate of mature markets slows down, emerging regions such as North
China, East China, and Southwest China have all achieved revenue growth of over 30% YoY, making the regional structure more
balanced. By the first half of 2025, the company's channel terminal outlets reached 4.2 million, a net increase of 200,000 compared
to the end of 2024, indicating further sinking and expansion of its marketing network. On the product side, in addition to energy
drinks, new products such as electrolyte drinks and fruit teas have achieved rapid sales growth, and the product portfolio has
become increasingly rich. Leveraging its advantages in channels, brands, and products, the company is expected to consolidate its
leading position in markets such as energy drinks and electrolyte water, and steadily move towards the goal of becoming a
comprehensive beverage group.
Profit Forecast and Investment Recommendation. We predict that the company's operating revenue from 2025 to 2027 will be
20.88 billion yuan, 25.39 billion yuan, and 30.03 billion yuan respectively, with YoY growth rates of 31.8%, 21.6%, and 18.2%. The
net profit attributable to shareholders will be 4.57 billion yuan, 5.77 billion yuan, and 6.89 billion yuan respectively, with YoY
growth rates of 37.4%, 26.2%, and 19.4%. The earnings per share (EPS) will be 8.8 yuan, 11.1 yuan, and 13.2 yuan respectively.
Referring to the valuation of comparable companies, we assign a 30x PE multiple to the company for 2026, corresponding to a
target price of 333 yuan, and give an "Outperform" rating.
Risk Tips: Intense industry competition; Rising raw material prices.
ESG Comments
Environmental:
The company has not been punished for any environmental issues.
Social:
The company actively protects the rights and interests of shareholders, creditors, consumers, and customers.
Governance:
The company's governance structure did not undergo significant adjustments.

海通国际 A 股覆盖：海通国际可能会就沪港通及深港通的中国 A 股进行覆盖及评级。国泰海通证券（601211.CH），海通国际于上海的母公司，也会于中国发布中国 A 股的研究报告。
