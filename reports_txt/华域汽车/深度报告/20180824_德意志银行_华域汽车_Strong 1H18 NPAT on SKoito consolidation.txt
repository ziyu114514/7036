Strong 1H18 NPAT on SKoito

Research Analyst
1H18 NPAT up 48% YoY to RMB4.8bn
Huayu announced its 1H18 results with NPAT at RMB4.8bn, up 48% YoY. The
earnings improvement was supported by topline growth (up 19% YoY) and surge
Vincent Ha, CFA
in investment gain (up 55% YoY). The investment income was mostly associated
Research Analyst
with RMB918m revaluation gain on Huayu's original stake at Shanghai Koito
Automotive Lamp (SKoito), triggered by Huayu's acquisition of the remaining
SKoito stake in 1Q18. Excluding this non-recurring item, Huayu’s 1H18 core NPAT
Price/price relative
grew 8.5% YoY.
Overseas business is still lagging
In 1H18, Huayu's topline grew by 19% YoY to RMB82bn, with domestic market
increasing by 27% YoY, thanks to the additional contribution by SKoito. Huayu
Vision Technology (or previously known as Shanghai Koito) recorded revenue of
RMB7.7bn in 1H18. Management is confident that the subsidiary will achieve 20%
revenue growth with solid demand from its key client SAIC and improved product
mix. For the overseas business, weakness continued with revenue down 3% YoY,
as consolidation is still taking time and U.S demand remained lackluster. On a
positive note, overseas margin improved in 2Q18 compared to 1Q18, according
to management.
Valuation and risks
Our target price is based on 12x FY18/19E P/E; we believe this is justified given a
FY17-20E three-year net profit CAGR of 11%. The company is currently trading at
~10x forward P/E, which is relatively lower compared to Asian auto parts players
(16x median, 22x mean) and global peers (13x median, 15x mean). We maintain
Buy on attractive valuation and yield. Key downside risks: weaker auto sales and
unexpected increases in raw material prices.

Macroeconomic fluctuations often account for most of the risks associated with exposures to instruments that promise
to pay fixed or variable interest rates. For an investor who is long fixed-rate instruments (thus receiving these cash
flows), increases in interest rates naturally lift the discount factors applied to the expected cash flows and thus
cause a loss. The longer the maturity of a certain cash flow and the higher the move in the discount factor, the
higher will be the loss. Upside surprises in inflation, fiscal funding needs, and FX depreciation rates are among the
most common adverse macroeconomic shocks to receivers. But counterparty exposure, issuer creditworthiness, client
segmentation, regulation (including changes in assets holding limits for different types of investors), changes in tax
policies, currency convertibility (which may constrain currency conversion, repatriation of profits and/or liquidation of
positions), and settlement issues related to local clearing houses are also important risk factors. The sensitivity of fixed-
income instruments to macroeconomic shocks may be mitigated by indexing the contracted cash flows to inflation, to
FX depreciation, or to specified interest rates – these are common in emerging markets. The index fixings may – by
construction – lag or mis-measure the actual move in the underlying variables they are intended to track. The choice of
the proper fixing (or metric) is particularly important in swaps markets, where floating coupon rates (i.e., coupons indexed
to a typically short-dated interest rate reference index) are exchanged for fixed coupons. Funding in a currency that differs
from the currency in which coupons are denominated carries FX risk. Options on swaps (swaptions) the risks typical to
options in addition to the risks related to rates movements.
Derivative transactions involve numerous risks including market, counterparty default and illiquidity risk. The
appropriateness of these products for use by investors depends on the investors' own circumstances, including their
tax position, their regulatory environment and the nature of their other assets and liabilities; as such, investors should
take expert legal and financial advice before entering into any transaction similar to or inspired by the contents of this
publication. The risk of loss in futures trading and options, foreign or domestic, can be substantial. As a result of the
high degree of leverage obtainable in futures and options trading, losses may be incurred that are greater than the
amount of funds initially deposited - up to theoretically unlimited losses. Trading in options involves risk and is not
suitable for all investors. Prior to buying or selling an option, investors must review the "Characteristics and Risks of

Participants in foreign exchange transactions may incur risks arising from several factors, including the following: (i)
exchange rates can be volatile and are subject to large fluctuations; (ii) the value of currencies may be affected by numerous
market factors, including world and national economic, political and regulatory events, events in equity and debt markets
and changes in interest rates; and (iii) currencies may be subject to devaluation or government-imposed exchange controls,
which could affect the value of the currency. Investors in securities such as ADRs, whose values are affected by the
currency of an underlying security, effectively assume currency risk.
