  "notice_content": "　　卓胜微(300782)\r\n　　Maxscend released its FY24results.Revenue went up by2.5%YoY toRMB4.5bn,missing CMBI estimates/BBG consensus by2%/1%.NP declinedsignificantly by64.2%YoY to RMB402mn,missing CMBI estimates/BBGconsensus by28%/21%.GPM/NPM declined by7.0ppt/16.7ppt to39.5%/9.0%in FY24(vs.46.4%/25.6%in FY23)due to margin pressure from subsidiaryXinzhuo’s ramp-up as the company transitions from a fabless model to a fab-litestrategy.We remain constructive on Maxscend’s long-term growth prospects asit builds platform-level manufacturing capability and strategic supply chainindependence.However,we maintain HOLD rating as near-term marginpressure persists,with TP adjusted downward to RMB82.0,based on arolled-over45x2026E P/E.\r\n　　4Q24experienced net loss for the first time due to fab ramp-up;marginpressure remains an overhang in2025.In4Q24,revenue declined by14.2%YoY but increased by3.4%QoQ,while bottom-line saw a net loss ofRMB24mn.Mgmt.attributed the loss to increased depreciation and highmask costs tied to the migration of key products onto its in-house6/12-inchlines.NPM was-2.1%in4Q24(vs.6.6%/23.2%in3Q24/4Q23).We believeMaxscend will face ongoing margin headwinds especially in1H25(GPM:38.0%,on our estimates),given fabs’ramp-up and slow recovery in end-market demand.We forecast Margin to gradually recover in2H25(GPM:41.7%,on our estimates)on seasonality and emerging demand from AIedge devices.We project overall GPM to be slightly up to40.2%in FY25E(39.5%in FY24).\r\n　　Module momentum continues as vertical integration starts to pay off.Module sales(42%of total rev.)grew by18.6%YoY in FY24,while discretesales(56%of total rev.)declined by7.6%YoY.The growth in modulerevenue reflects the modularization trend in RFFE industry.Lookingforward,we expect module business to be the key growth driver(+25%YoYin2025E).The rise in module shipments reflects Maxscend’s in-housewafer and packaging capabilities,enabling faster product iteration andtighter component integration.Gross margins for module/discrete segmentswere36%/42%in FY24,down from46%/47%in FY23,but are likely toimprove as utilization increases,in our view.\r\n　　Maintain HOLD,with TP adjusted down to RMB82.We view2025as atransition year for Maxscend,and we revise down our revenue/NP forecastsby7%/42%in FY25E,given a slower-than-expected recovery in demandand stronger margin erosion on fab ramp-up.Our new TP is based on45x2026E P/E,10%higher than peers’avg.of40.7x considering its leadingposition in RFFE market and important role in semiconductor localization.Potential upside catalysts:stronger-than-expected recovery and fastersemiconductor localization due to geopolitical risks.Potential downsiderisks:slower-than-expected capacity ramp-up,delay in R&D progress.",
