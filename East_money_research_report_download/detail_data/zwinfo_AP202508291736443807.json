  "notice_content": "　　中际旭创(300308)\r\n　　Innolight delivered exceptionally strong2Q25results.Quarterly revenuewas a record RMB8.1bn,up36%/22%YoY/QoQ,driven by robust demand forhigh-end optical modules.Net profit surged to RMB2.4bn,up79%/52%YoY/QoQ,beating BBG consensus by28%.Both GPM and NPM hit recordhighs at41.5%/29.7%,outperforming consensus by5.7ppt/7.2ppt.Innolightannounced its first interim dividend of RMB0.4per share,boosting shareholderreturns.Maintain BUY and raise TP to RMB415,based on30x rollover2026EP/E(previously27x2025E P/E),as we revise up earnings forecasts to reflectour positive outlook on the company,indicating sustained momentum in AI-driven demand and mgmt.’s superior execution.\r\n　　Sequential revenue improvement driven by optical transceivers’salesincrease(up40%/98%YoY/QoQ).Mgmt.highlighted strong shipments of800G products,with1.6T commencing ramp-up in2Q and shipment toaccelerate through2H25.Notably,the company’s silicon photonics(SiPh)based1.6T solutions are gaining traction with leading cloud customers.\r\n　　AI capex cycle to support sustained growth.Overseas revenue(86%of1H25sales)remained the primary growth driver.Per Bloomberg consensus,combined capex from key hyperscalers(Amazon/Google/Meta/Microsoft)isprojected to grow53%/17%YoY to US$329/350bn in2025/26E,revised upby5.7%/5.6%vs.consensus in May2025.We raise our2025/26E revenueforecasts by5%/5%,respectively,factoring in stronger-than-expected AIinfrastructure investments.We project2025E revenue to increase60%/32%YoY.\r\n　　Significant margin expansion due to robust800G/1.6T shipments andSiPh adoption.In1H,optical transceivers’GPM rose6.1ppt YoY to40.0%,while NPM increased by5.8ppt YoY to29.7%.The record margins weredriven by1)a higher sales contribution of800G/1.6T products,2)increasingadoption of higher-margin SiPh solutions,and3)efficient supply-chainmanagement(raw material inventory rose17%QoQ in2Q).1.6T products,predominantly shipped in SiPh form,yield a better margin than earliergenerations.We lift2025/26E GPM projections to43.0%/42.7%from39%/38%,anticipating further margin expansion as1.6T shipments scaleup and SiPh solutions increase.Mass production of1.6T products in2Hshould support sequential margin improvements.\r\n　　Maintain BUY,with TP adjusted to RMB415,based on30x rollover2026EP/E,equivalent to1-SD above5-year historical avg,justified by Innolight’sleadership in a fast-growing AI optical market.Our NP forecasts for2025/26E are revised up by28%/30%,on higher revenue and GPM\r\n　　geopolitical/tariff uncertainties,supply chain disruptions and intensifiedcompetitions,etc.",
