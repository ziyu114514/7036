  "notice_content": "　　卓胜微(300782)\r\n　　Maxscend released2Q25results.Revenue was RMB948mn in2Q25,up25%QoQ from a low base in1Q but down13%YoY,reflecting continued softness inend-market demand and intensified competition.During the period,GPM fell to27%(-4ppt/-14ppt vs.1Q25/2Q24)in2Q25,missing BBG consensus estimatesof34%,due to1)ongoing price pressure,2)impact from depreciation,and3)lower-than-expected fab utilization.Net loss widened to RMB101mn in2Q(NLM:-11%)from-RMB47mn in1Q(NLM:-6%).We cut our2025/26E revenueforecasts by21%/22%to reflect weaker-than-expected demand and persistentpricing pressure.We also lower GPM projections by9ppts/7ppts to32%/37%in2025/26E,factoring in near-term margin headwinds from elevated depreciation.Maintain HOLD with TP of RMB81.5.\r\n　　Revenue declined on soft demand,while product developmentprogress stayed intact.China’s smartphone shipment grew3.3%YoY in1Q25on government subsidies but decreased4%/4%YoY/QoQ in2Q asdemand fell.The weak recovery in market demand(2025smartphoneshipment to grow by0.6%/1.9%YoY,per IDC/Counterpoint)and slower-than-expected industry consolidation weighed on Maxscend’s performance.1H25sales dropped25%YoY,although RF modules now accounted for44%of total revenue,up from36%/42%in FY23/24.This shift demonstrates thecompany’s progress in product development(i.e.,L-PAMiD,equipped within-house MAX-SAW,reflecting a fully localized supply chain).We expectmodule revenue to exceed50%of total sales in2027E,aligning with industrymodularization and localization trends.However,without a strong reboundin demand,we expect Maxscend’s overall revenue to decrease by9%in2025E.\r\n　　Margin headwinds persist.Maxscend booked a D&A expense ofRMB323mn in1H25,up22%YoY from RMB265mn in1H24.Althoughdepreciation growth may have peaked,absolute expense is expected toremain elevated in the near term as the company ramps up its12-inch IPDline(1H25capacity:5kwm).We think improved fab utilization across the6-inch and12-inch lines should help ease margin pressure over time.Weexpect overall GPM to be32%in2025,given ongoing margin erosion as fabramps up.\r\n　　Maintain HOLD.We see2025-26E as transitioning years for Maxscend.Ournew TP is based on45x2026E EV/EBITDA(vs.prior45x2026E P/E),slightly higher than0.5-SD below5-year historical avg.of44x,reflectingongoing business model shift toward fab-lite/IDM.While Maxscend is well-positioned in the RFFE market and China’s localization,we think its marginrecovery may take another year.Upside catalysts:stronger-than-expectedrecovery,accelerated localization.Potential downside risks:slower capacityramp-up,R&D delays.",
