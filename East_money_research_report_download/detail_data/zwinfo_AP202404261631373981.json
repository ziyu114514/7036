We believethe strong 1H24 outlook is mainly driven by 1) datacenter connectivity(optic/copper) products, cooling and power solutions, and 2) auto bizmomentum on stronger NEV and ADAS/AD demand from overseas markets.Looking forward, despite recent macro headwinds and iPhone shipmentweakness, we believe Luxshare is well-positioned to capture opportunities indatacentre connectivity business, automotive connector business, gain share iniPhone/MacBook/iPad/Watch OEM/components and Apple’s multiple productlaunches in 2H24E.
