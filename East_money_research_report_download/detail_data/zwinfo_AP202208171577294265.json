  "notice_content": "　　生益科技(600183)\r\n　　Shengyi Tech’s  2Q22 revenue/NP to shareholders declined  13.5% YoY/47.9% YoY to RMB4,607mn/RMB453mn. 2Q results miss was  due to 1) weak demand from consumer markets, 2)  ASP pressure due to peers’ aggressive price war and 3) significant energy cost increase. GPM decreased slightly to 23.2% in 2Q from 23.6%  in  1Q.  Looking  forward,  we  expect  PCB  to  outperform  CCL  business, driven by capacity ramp up for auto market and easing margin pressure. We cut our forecasts for 2022/23E and slightly tweaked TP to RMB19.2. Maintain HOLD.\r\n　　CCL  business  under  pressure.  CCL/prepreg  sales  declined  18.3%/4.4% YoY/QoQ in  2Q  (vs. 4.0%/-4.8% in  1Q). GPM decreased to 22.7% in 1H22 from 25.7%/29.3% in 2H21/1H21.  2Q  may be the weakest quarter for CCL, due  to  deteriorating   demand  and  price  war.  However,  2H22  could  still  be challenging as market demand is still on its way of slow recovery, especially for consumers. ASP should have reached  the  bottom given little room to cut price further. \r\n　　PCB  business  to  continue  outperform.  PCB  sales  grew  14.2%/9.1% YoY/QoQ in 2Q  (vs. 7.2%/-12.2% in 1Q). GPM decreased to 21.2% in 1H22 from 16.5%/18.8% in 2H21/1H21. The majority  of  PCB sales  were  from  the telecom market, which remain stable.  We believe the growth was mainly from the  auto market. Auto PCB  has  experienced fast growth in 2021, with revenue contribution  increasing  from  1%  to  8%,  thanks  to  production  ramp  up. Prismark forecasts PCB market to grow 4.2% YoY in 2022, moderate growth after  significant  growth  of  24.1%  YoY  in  2021.  We  think  Shengyi  will outperform  peers,  driven  by  strong  demand  from  auto  market,  increasing capacity and easing margin pressure. \r\n　　Maintain  HOLD,  TP  adjusted  to  RMB19.2.  We  cut  Shengyi’s  FY22-23Erevenue by 9%-10% considering CCL demand recovery could be slow. We derive our TP using the same 16.6x  target  P/E multiple,~  avg. 1-yr forward P/E.  TP  was  adjusted  to  RMB19.2  on  valuation  rollover  to  2023E  P/E.Potential downside risks include: 1) worse-than-expected global economy that curbs  consumer  spending,  2)  continuous  ASP  pressure  and  3)  increasing manufacturing costs, i.e. energy costs.",
