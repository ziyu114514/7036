  "notice_content": "　　隆基股份(601012)\r\n　　LONGi  realized  3Q20  net  profit  of  RMB2,240mn;  beat  our  expectation.  The Company continued to deliver outstanding GPM from wafer and module at above 30%/20%  respectively,  despite  the  fact  that  poly-si  and  PV  glass  price experienced substantial hike during the quarter. We think LONGi’s supply chain management  and  insight  to  the  market  helped  sustain  its  leading  profitability. Looking ahead, we expect LONGi to accelerate wafer and module sales to 2.6bn piece and 5.8GW respectively. We raise FY20-22E EPS forecast by 8.2%-30.0% to  RMB2.25/3.10/4.06,  respectively.  Our  TP  is  lifted  to  RMB90.0  based  on 29.0x FY21E PER. Maintain BUY.\r\n　　3Q20 results beat again. 3Q external wafer/module shipment surged 23.7% /114.6%  respectively  to  1.57bn  piece/5.91GW.  Major  expenses  were maintained  stable,  while  net  financial  turned  negative  as  LONGi  employed higher debt. Operating cash flow exhibited strong rebound as bills rece ivables accumulated  in  1H20  were  released  during  the  quarter,  and  advanced customer  payment  from  domestic  clients  were  mostly  paid  in  cash  due  to tightened module supply. 3Q20 net profit was RMB2,240mn, up 51.9% YoY and largely flat QoQ. In 9M20, LONGi realized net profit of RMB6,357mn, up 82.4% YoY, accounting for 81% of our previous 2020E earnings estimates. \r\n　　Supply  chain  management  was  a  key  highlight  in  3Q20.  Poly-si  price experienced a sharp hike from Jul after supply disruption in Xinjiang. LONGiwas able to manage supply shortage impacts through building low costs polysi inventories in 1H20, and signing long term purchasing as well as upstream investments contracts to secure poly-si supply. For PV glass, we think LONGi took similar measures as poly-si, and the Company also intends to develop more  new  suppliers  with  incentives  such  as  large-scale  order  or  direct investments.  Mgmt.  disclosed  3Q20  GPM  of  wafer/module  were  above 30%/20% respectively, which were higher than our expectation. \r\n　　GPM guidance to remain stable in 4Q20.  LONGi had lifted wafer price for several  times  in  view  of  poly-si  price  hike.  Mgmt.  remained  confident  to maintain  wafer  sales  profitability  with  pricing  adjustments  as  low  costs inventories were consumed. For module end, we think LONGi will be able to pass through majority of poly-si and PV glass costs change to downstream PV farm developers. Overall, we think LONGi will be able to sustain its profitability. \r\n　　Lift FY20-22E earnings by 8.2-30%. LONGi’s supply chain performance and costs passthrough capability continued to exceed our expectation. Based on wafer/module shipment of 26bn pieces/5.8GW in 4Q20 with slightly lifted ASP, we revise FY20E EPS projection by 8.2% to RMB2.25. For 2021-22E, on the back of accelerating capacity  growth  and more optimistic ASP  outlook, we raise EPS forecast by 20.4%/30.0% respectively to  RMB3.10/4.06. We roll over valuation to FY21E based on 29x P/E multiple. Our  TP  is raised  by 24.3%to RMB90.0. Maintain BUY. \r\n　　Risk factors: 1) short of Poly-Si and PV glass to support capacity expansion in 2021E; and 2) cell technology upgrade to HJT at faster-than-expected pace.",
