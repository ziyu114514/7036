  "notice_content": "　　迈瑞医疗(300760)\r\n　　In2024,Mindray reported revenue of RMB36.7bn(+5.1%YoY)and attributablenet profit of RMB11.7bn(+0.7%YoY).GPM dropped by1.1ppts YoY to63.1%,primarily due to1)pricing pressure on IVD reagents and mid-to low-end medicalequipment,2)weaker IVD testing demand following DRG2.0implementationand inter-hospital recognition of test results.The proportion of revenue from IVDreagent declined in4Q24.The Sino-US trade frictions may raise costs for US-sourced raw materials in2025E,while Mindray is actively seeking substitutes toprotect margins.In1Q25,Mindray’s revenue fell by12.1%YoY to RMB8.2bn,mainly due to1)over20%YoY decline in domestic revenue,as revenuerecognition lagged behind procurement recovery,2)a high overseas revenuebase in1Q24(up nearly30%YoY),resulting in slow1Q25overseas growth of4.3%YoY.\r\n　　Steady growth from overseas.In2024,overseas revenue grew by21.3%YoY to RMB16.4bn,accounting for44.7%of total revenue(+6.0ppts).Ex-North America revenue rose26%YoY to RMB13.8bn,with Asia-Pacificcontinuing as the growth engine.Mindray achieved further breakthroughs inhigh-end markets,with high-end strategic customers contributing14%ofoverseas revenue.With enhanced localization and installations of high-endproducts such as the MT8000,we expect the overseas revenue to grow bya mid-teens percentage in2025E.As the US contributed only~6%ofMindray’s total revenue,the impact of trade frictions may be moderate.Diversified manufacturing across13countries and proactive inventorymanagement should help mitigate related risks.\r\n　　Domestic market remained under pressure.In2024,domestic revenuedecreased by5.1%YoY to RMB20.3bn.Revenue from PMLS and MISsegments fell31%YoY and2%YoY,respectively,due to weak hospitalprocurement.According to IQVIA,China’s medical equipment marketdecreased12.3%YoY in2024.Policy headwinds including DRG2.0,inter-hospital recognition of test results,and reagent price cuts further weighedon IVD revenue.IQVIA estimated a decline in the biochemical market andflat growth in immunology market in2024.Therefore,Mindray’s domesticIVD revenue increased1%YoY in2024.However,Joinchain data shows a67.5%YoY increase in medical equipment bidding value in1Q25,indicatingpotential recovery of domestic medical equipment procurement.Weanticipate the revenue recovery will occur in2H25E,primarily due to thetime lag between the bidding process and revenue recognition.\r\n　　Maintain BUY.Given the uncertainties of the timeline of domesticprocurement recovery and trade frictions,we revise down our earningsforecasts.We expect revenue and attributable net profit to grow9.4%and6.5%YoY,respectively,in2025E.Based on a9-year DCF model,we adjustour TP to RMB249.19(WACC:9.2%,terminal growth rate:3.0%).",
