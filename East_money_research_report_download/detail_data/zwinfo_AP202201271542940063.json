  "notice_content": "　　生益科技(600183)\n　　Shengyi Tech announced FY21 preliminary results, expecting FY21 net profit to Current Price RMB 20.56grow 56-73% YoY to RMB2.62bn-RMB2.90bn. Mid-point of 4Q21 net profit isexpected to reach RMB421mn, representing +11% YoY and -55% QoQ. Midpoint of FY21 result is ~6%/-9% below consensus/our forecasts. We loweredFY21-22E EPS by 9% and adjusted TP to RMB23.50 based on 19x FY22E P/E(vs. previous 22.5x FY22E P/E). Downgrade to HOLD.\n　　Robust FY21 results but weaker 4Q net profit. The company deliveredrobust 9M21 growth of 44% YoY, but 4Q21 earnings declined 55% QoQ,mainly due to weaker sales and lower GPM. Looking forward, we see slowergrowth due to high base in FY21 and uncertainty in macro economy.\n　　Resistance to transfer material cost pressure to downstream clients.The copper price has increased significantly in past year, with 50% YoYbased on average daily close price. LME 3M Copper price remains high,closed at US$9,846 per ton as of Jan 25, 2020. We believe demand havedeteriorated due to prolonged period of increasing material costs. Meanwhile,it also put pressure on GPM, due to increasing difficulty to transfer the pricecost to downstream clients.\n　　Bright spot on auto PCB. Shengyi’s auto-related business accounted for~25% of total revenue. Its clients include traditional and EV auto companies.In 2021, auto sales had the highest order visibility and higher price upside.We expect the auto sales will continue to grow in 2022, driven by robust EVmarket demand and continuous electrification.\n　　Downgrade to HOLD and adjusted TP to RMB23.5. Our new TP ofRMB23.5 is based on lowered 19x FY22 P/E (vs. previous 22.5x due tolimited CCL ASP upside). Trading at 17.4x FY22E P/E, we think the valuationis fair due to slower earnings growth in FY22/23E. Potential upsides includecontinuing transferring of material costs and higher-than-expected marketdemand. Potential risks include less-than-expected transfer of material costsand weaker market demand.\n",
